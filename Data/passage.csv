0,"It’ll be just like old times this weekend for Tom Brady and Wes Welker. Welker revealed Friday morning on a Miami radio station that he contacted Brady because he’ll be in town for Sunday’s game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium. It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up. But Brady’s definition of ""catching up"" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal ""catching"" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension. ""I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ "" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. ""And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ "" Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy. ""That’s the only thing we really have planned,"" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. ""It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something."" Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough.",how about that morning we go throw?
5,"One of the biggest surprise announcements at Apple's iPhone event on Wednesday was the introduction of AirPods, Apple's totally wireless headphones. AirPods really do look beautiful and futuristic, but one of the first questions we had about these wireless headphones was about theft. What happens if someone steals your AirPods? What if you're on the subway and someone snatches one or both out of your ears and runs away? Does Apple have a way of preventing this kind of theft? The short answer, unfortunately, is no. Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you'll have to buy new ones, just like any other Apple product. There's no anti-theft measures in place to protect your shiny wireless earbuds. That said, if one of your two AirPods is lost or stolen, Apple says you'll be able to buy just one. (Apple didn't say how much it would cost to buy just one.) So there you have it. Until Apple creates some kind of Touch ID for your ears, you'll have very few security measures to ensure your AirPods don't get lost or stolen. So be careful with them — at $159, they're not cheap.","Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you'll have to buy new ones, just like any other Apple product."

But, why? Why would you favour a pair of pants that look like they might have been found in the lost property bin of a secondary school? Are they fused to him? Are his legs allergic to grass? Is he constantly hungover? In fact, the reason the oldest player at Euro 2016 wears those snazzy, grey marl bastards is down to a longstanding superstition or ""kabbalah"", as he explained during an interview, in 2005: ""The more good games I had in them, the more I got used to them. I had many good games in them, especially at Hertha Berlin in the Champions League and with the Hungarian national team."" He'll be hoping they provide Hungary with plenty of luck during the European Championships.","""The more good games I had in them, the more I got used to them."

8,"5/5 say yes. Cheers to your health! All five of our experts give red wine a purple-stained smile. At 125 calories for a five-ounce pour, it's a lighter choice than beer and mixed drinks, says Julia Zumpano , a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic’s Heart & Vascular Institute. And yes, it's got more antioxidants, too—including resveratrol, that famous compound billed as the miracle in chocolate and vino. But recent research has given resveratrol the side eye as the reason for wine's healthy glow. The aptly-named inCHIANTI study, a 16-year-long look at the blood, urine and dietary questionnaires of hundreds of people living in the Italian wine-making region of Chianti, recently found that resveratrol wasn't associated with disease or lifespan, to the shock and dismay of wine lovers everywhere. But that doesn't mean red wine does nothing for you—just that resveratrol might not be compound that deserves all the credit. ""Many studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, especially wine, is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and mortality compared with both no alcohol consumption or consumption above moderate,"" says Luigi Ferrucci , founder of the inCHIANTI study and now scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. ""The mechanism of this association is not clear, and does not appear to be related to resveratrol."" And even if it does have a positive effect, some experts say there's likely not enough in a glass to make a difference. ""Despite the common belief, resveratrol content in wine is very low, highly variable and thus unpredictable ,"" says Juan Carlos Espín , a research professor in the department of food science and technology at the Spanish National Research Council who studies the compound. Red wine's wide spectrum of polyphenols is the more important part, and you'll probably have to commit to the habit (moderately!) to get lasting health benefits, he says. What we do know, says David Katz , MD, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, is that drinking habitually but moderately prevails in the Mediterranean diet. ""So whatever the mechanisms, moderate alcohol intake—perhaps red wine especially—is associated with health and long life,"" Katz says. Light drinking in general—up to a drink a day for women, and two for men—is known to be good for you, says James O'Keefe, MD, chief of preventive cardiology at Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. It’s associated with lower risk for coronary artery disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure and stroke. And all of our experts agreed that red wine takes the ribbon. ""Red wine is clearly the drink of choice if you are doing light to moderate drinking for your health, and daily consumption just before or with the evening meal may be the most protective pattern,"" O’Keefe says. In fact, O’Keefe says his grandma Dorothy used to enjoy a happy hour drink every night, and she lived to be 103. ""She used to joke, ‘The key to a long healthy life is to not drink too much...but then again, don't drink too little either.’""","Red wine is clearly the drink of choice if you are doing light to moderate drinking for your health, and daily consumption just before or with the evening meal may be the most protective pattern,"" O’Keefe says"
13," The controversial past of public bathrooms Target, facing a boycott over its policy of allowing transgender customers and employees to use the bathroom of their choice, says it will spend $20 million to expand bathroom options at all of its U.S. stores. Target ( TGT CFO Cathy Smith said Wednesday that the company has heard objections to the transgender bathroom policy from some customers, though she said other customers had voiced support. In response, Target has decided to expand its use of a third, single-toilet bathroom at all of its stores, which can be locked by users. That bathroom can be used by any customer who needs some privacy, including parents with small children of a different gender or those who are uncomfortable with a public bathroom in which a transgender person is allowed. ""We put that in motion for some time prior to the [June] shareholders meeting,"" said spokeswoman Katie Boylan. ""At the end of the day, Target is all about inclusion. We want everyone to feel comfortable in our stores."" There are about 1,800 U.S. Target stores, and all but 300 already have the single occupancy bathrooms available. All but about 25 of those stores should have the new bathrooms by the end of the year, and the remaining stores should get them early in 2017, Boylan said. The retailer reported disappointing sales and cut its forecast on future sales Wednesday morning, sending its stock lower.

This raises the inevitable question: Is it safe?

That's why they invited BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons to stand on the bridge above a sample panel of glass, and go to town on it with a sledgehammer. But the result may not have been what they were looking for: OK, so in a sense, the experiment was a success. Although Simmons' first blow shattered the glass, he was unable to structurally compromise the underlying layers even after he let loose on it dozens of times. But that won't stop this video from making people who see it want to puke from terror. And is it really good press for this bridge to show it splintering instantly like a drunk college student's iPhone screen? Imagine if people were on that bridge and it cracked like that? Would they really care about the physics of its structural integrity? Or would they stampede to the other side, trampling each other like frightened elephants? That's the problem with glass bridges—everyone wants to give them a shot, but nobody is actually ready to accept death.","Although Simmons' first blow shattered the glass, he was unable to structurally compromise the underlying layers even after he let loose on it dozens of times."
15,"After adding a much requested pinch and zoom feature last week, Facebook-owned photo sharing giant Instagram is taking away a popular feature-photo maps. According to technology news site Mashable, Instagram is killing the feature that allowed you to see a map of where a given user's photos were taken (if they designated a location for the photo). You could also zoom in on maps to get a closer view of where photos were taken in a particular city or region. Instagram's base of approximately 500 million users can still see their own personal photo maps, but just no longer access other users' maps. ""Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other priorities,"" the company said in a statement to Mashable. The removal of a feature is a rarity for Instagram, which has been on a tear recently adding new features as it looks to compete with mobile messaging rival Snapchat. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. For example, with Pinch and Zoom, users can use the pinch and zoom gesture on their iPhone screen to zoom on photos and videos in the main feed, on other user’s profiles, and in the explore tab of the app. A few weeks ago, Instagram debuted a new feature called Stories, operating similar to Snapchat’s feature with the same name. Like Snapchat’s Stories, the Instagram version allows users to collect a number of individual photos and videos into a ""story"" that they can share with their followers. The Facebook-owned app also recently launched an events-themed video section, which is comparable to a feature that Snapchat has been offering for some time. Earlier this year, Instagram started filtering its main feed using an algorithm, following in the footsteps of parent company Facebook.",the feature that allowed you to see a map of where a given user's photos were taken (if they designated a location for the photo).
16,"The subway is a germaphobe’s nightmare: the steep stairs that dare you not to hold the handrail, the ticket-vending touchscreen tacky with fingerprints, the smush of people packed together, all with questionable levels of hygiene. This must mean that subway cars are just as packed with microbes . But should we be worried? A group of researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health wanted to find out, so they took a bunch of trips on the Boston city subway and started swabbing. In their new study published in the American Society for Microbiology’s journal mSystems , the scientists report on what they found when they sampled the seats, seat backs, walls, poles, ticketing machines and hanging straps on the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. They were amazed at how much the city subway looks, microbially speaking, like a mosaic of humans. The most dominant bacteria on all of the surfaces were from people's skin and mouths. And the kinds of colonies that thrived in certain places, like hanging grips, depended on how that surface is used: the scientists found enriched colonies of breathing-borne bacteria on touchscreens and vaginal bacteria on fuzzy polyester seats. Happily, though, the scientists didn’t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes. ""I was surprised by the degree to which these environments really do look like people,"" says senior author Curtis Huttenhower, associate professor of computational biology and bioinformatics. ""But if you think about the relative size of a bacteria compared to how porous clothing is, it’s no surprise that we’re shedding all sorts of bugs."" In the future, this kind of technology might be helpful to monitor the microbes in different environments, like a subway, an airport or a kindergarten classroom. If the colonies started to shift from their normal state, that could signal the start of flu season or an early outbreak of norovirus, for example, and officials would get an early cue that it’s time to step up interventions like handwashing. So ditch the tissue when you hold the train pole. Riding the subway, Huttenhower says, is just like shaking a bunch of people’s hands.",scientists didn’t find pathogenic organisms that typically cause sickness or antibiotic-resistant genes
17,"Ever wonder why there are only like, 12 Gryffindors in Harry's year? Ever wondered how many students are at Hogwarts? J.K. Rowling's response in an interview back in 2000 gave the answer: about 1,000.  But when you look closer, that number doesn't make a lot of sense. Why are there so few students in Harry's class? This screencap shows Percy Weasley taking the first-year Gryffindors to their common room. In this scene, there are only about 18 students. Even in the books, Gryffindors in Harry's year besides Dean, Seamus, and the other usual suspects are rarely mentioned. That's almost half as many students as there should be, if Hogwarts has 1,000 students as Rowling said. There are seven years, and four houses. So theoretically, there should be about 35 Gryffindor students in Harry's year, almost double the 18 we see. So, why the lack of students? This Tumblr user has a very sad answer: TLDR: There are fewer kids in Harry's year and thereabouts because of the war with Voldemort. Which is a pretty sad thought. If that was the case, we should expect a bit of a baby boom in the years under Harry, as that tends to happen following major wars. Voldemort's reign occurred from about 1970 to 1981, so we would expect small classes in the years above Harry as well, but larger ones in the years below. Of course, none of this explains the sheer numbers of the Weasley family.",because of the war with Voldemort.

The dance was downright infectious. But did you ever actually listen to the lyrics? It begins in the first verse, right after the lyrics ""When I dance they call me Macarena, and the boys they say ‘que estoy buena’..."" Macarena is a siren, enticing young men to come and dance with her. If they can manage to curry her favor, she may even take them home with her. So far, nothing too unusual, right?

Then at the end of the second verse, it becomes totally clear what’s happening: Wait...TWO GUYS?! At ONCE?!

21,"By Mark Alsip and Kavin Senapathy Depending on whom you ask, Goop.com is either a ritzy lifestyle publication or a grab bag of the ridiculous, from advice on vaginal steam treatments to a shopping section featuring a $73 wooden spoon and a $576 earring (you read that right; it’s a single earring for the left ear). The site’s curator, actress and aspirational human being Gwyneth Paltrow, isn’t only out to sell a lifestyle but to protect us from the so-called toxins she claims lurk in beauty products, foods and non-steamed vaginas found in average neighborhoods, poisoning unsuspecting commoners. The site’s name is derived from Paltrow’s initials and features her face throughout, at times smiling, other times solemn, and occasionally covered in high-end luxury goop, known as face cream or mask for the frugal department store shoppers. In other words, Goop is an internet extension of all things Gwyneth. As Paltrow herself has been called a hypocrite, for everything from smoking cigarettes once a week to attending a swanky gala mere hours after publicly shopping on a food stamp budget, so too should Goop be judged. When celebs and sites whose advice fans hold dear warn against exposure to certain ostensibly harmful chemicals and in the next breath sell products containing those same substances, we wonder whether they’re disingenuous or sincerely misinformed. This chemical hypocrisy is a common phenomenon as co-author Mark Alsip frequently reveals on his Bad Science Debunked blog, and one Goop is no stranger to. In the Goop article ""Full-On—Yet Totally Non-Toxic—Lipstick,"" the site recommends seven ""better-than-good-enough-to-eat"" lip colors that aren’t ""potentially toxic."" This and other Goop articles suggest dire health consequences from topical use or ingestion of several chemicals including aluminum, and personal care products containing it are squarely in the lifestyle maven’s crosshairs. An entire Goop exposé dedicated to ""toxic"" lipsticks features aluminum, the most common metal in the Earth’s crust, prominently as an ingredient to avoid. Since Goop asserts that aluminum is harmful even in small amounts, we wonder whether Paltrow’s team intentionally overlooked that two of the three Rituel de Fille ""Forbidden"" lipsticks the site sells contain aluminum hydroxide. Paltrow’s unscientific definition of a ""dangerous"" chemical compound seems to be the mere presence of aluminum rather than the amount and mode of exposure, an important distinction toxicologists make. Nearly a dozen products on Goop contain the element in various compounds, and peddling the item on the same website that calls it dangerous is indefensible. Aluminum, Paltrow’s site warns, can contribute to heavy metal toxicity, calling the condition ""one of the greatest threats to our health and well-being."" Perhaps Goop needs to add a disclaimer: Expect hyperbole. Though Goop says that heavy metal toxicity is ""quite common,"" experts disagree. ""Unfortunately for quacks (and fortunately for us), genuine heavy metal poisoning is increasingly uncommon,"" explains Dr. David Gorski, outspoken critic of alternative medicine, at the Science Based Medicine blog. ""[O]ften the diagnosis of ""heavy metal toxicity"" made by alt-med practitioners is based on 'provoked' urine levels, a methodology that has no validity.""","contain the element in various compounds, and peddling the item on the same website that calls it dangerous"
22,"An Afghan migrant attacked a woman at an asylum centre in Austria because she was reading a bible. The attack took place in the town on Timelkam in the state of Upper Austria. The attacker was a 22-year-old migrant from Afghanistan who became annoyed that the 50-year-old woman had been invited by Christian residents to read the bible. Austrian paper Kronen Zeitung says he ran into the kitchen where the woman was talking and attempted to stab her in her upper body. Her thick winter coat protected from serious harm, however she fell and injured her ear due the force of the blow. Police arrived at the scene and arrested the migrant. He admitted he had overreacted, although he told police this was due to ""personal problems"". He also stated that he had never seen the woman before the attack. There have been numerous incidents of Christians coming under attack in migrant centres across Europe. One charity said that over 700 Christians have been attacked in German asylums homes since May 2016, with the majority of perpetrators being Muslim. Christian charity Open Doors said that 83 per cent of the cases reported included multiple assaults, while almost half of victims claim they have received death threats from fellow migrants. Another 44 said they had been sexually assaulted. Over 90 per cent of the attackers were Muslim, and in 205 cases the attackers were not only Muslim but also guards at the centres. Breitbart London also reported in August how an Iranian-born German politician who converted to Christianity said that Christians face ongoing persecution in migrant homes. Mahin Mousapour said Christians in asylum centres were being told they are ""impure as a dog"". ""Toys of Christian children are being destroyed, Christian asylum seekers are told not only to wash their dishes after eating but also that they must clean the entire kitchen as it would otherwise be ‘unclean’. Many Muslim asylum seekers call all Christians unclean.

The studio made the announcement via press release on Tuesday, but THR had more on the move: Script issues are said to be the cause of the delay, though the move comes in the aftermath of 'The Lone Ranger's' failure at the box office this summer. That's not the official line from Disney, as the studio insiders told Deadline.com that the film's script was still being worked on and that the move was not cause for alarm. Prior to the ""Pirates 5"" shift, it was speculated that Disney could move ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" out of summer 2015 because of an already overcrowded calendar that also includes ""Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" Pixar's ""Inside Out"" and Marvel's ""Ant-Man."" All three of those films will arrive in theaters between May and July. (Whether ""Star Wars"" eventually moves to December of that year is still unconfirmed.)

In its quest to figure out how to make money and possibly move closer to an initial public offering, Snapchat is taking a huge dive into video advertising. Yes, according to Adweek, Snapchat will now run video ads in between your friends’ stories to give advertisers a better shot at reaching some of the company’s 150 million daily users. The video ads will be known by the extremely clever name Snap Ads Between Stories. The company’s first chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, known for his role in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s IPO, told Adweek this huge rollout was just the beginning. ""I think advertising is a very large opportunity, and we’re just getting started."" Imran Khan But, the company’s already done way more than ""just get started."" Snapchat already has 10 advertising partners lined up, including Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Verizon, Procter & Gamble, Warner Bros. and Express. To help encourage companies to start advertising on its platform, Snapchat also partnered with a number of creative agencies with expertise in making Snapchat ads, as well as agencies that can help with the tech and analytics side of advertising. Peter Sellis, Snapchat’s head of monetization product, told Adweek, We have to be thoughtful about the inventory, ad load and the ad experience. But we also know that we cannot build custom ad-tech solutions for every big type of advertiser, for every vertical. And so these [partners] really excel in those kinds of ways. Though the ads will occasionally show up in between different stories as users auto-advance, they won’t appear in the middle of one story in an attempt to not overwhelm users, according to TechCrunch. To that end, Snapchat also will apparently review every ad. I don’t know how much reviewing every ad will really help Snapchat’s users, but it’s good to see Snapchat being proactive about this rollout. Sellis added, By doing this the right way, focused on creativity and doing it early, it allows us to be extraordinarily conservative.

29,"I was about eight when someone showed me how to draw this. It started with two sets of three parallel lines that were joined diagonally left to right, then capped off at the top and bottom with pointy bits. It was a fierce, beautiful ""S,"" and drawing it was addictive. Soon all my schoolbooks were covered in the ""S."" I never questioned what it meant or where it came from. I just knew I loved it. But it turns out I wasn't the only one. I recently googled the ""S"" and discovered that although everyone loves it, no one knows its origins. Various Reddits and notice boards are full of really nostalgic people without a clue. It seems the ""S"" has appeared throughout all of North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia. Some people think it's a 90s thing; others report seeing it as early as the 1960s. There were theories that it was the symbol of some 80s hair-metal band. Other people thought it was the original emblem for the clothing brand Stussy. Others thought it was an incarnation of the Superman logo. No one was sure. I thought I'd ask the office. ""That's the Superman 'S,'"" mused Ben, our in-house graphics guy. I asked him if that meant it was actually from Superman, but he said it wasn't. ""No, I think it's just what kids think when they're drawing it. They really just draw it because it's cool."" I got on the phone to DC Comics to find out if they knew anything. According to Benjamin LeClear, who manages the comics library at their studio in Burbank, California, the ""S"" has nothing to do with Superman. ""It doesn't look like any of the emblems from the old Superman Shield logos,"" he said after rummaging through their collection. ""His 'S' has a lot of open space and almost never connects to itself."" LeClear told me he'd become intrigued and, like me, launched his own mini investigation on the web only to turn up nothing. ""I didn't realize what a crazy urban myth and mystery this pointy 'S' thing is,"" he said. ""I would love for this to be Superman-related, but I don't think it is. Though Superman has the most famous 'S' symbol of all time."" ""It's the Stussy 'S,'"" exclaimed Ramona, one of our producers. Like Ben's guess, she didn't think it was actually an emblem associated with Stussy, but refused to believe it had any other name. ""It's definitely called the Stussy 'S,'"" she said, then drew her own version that wasn't as good as mine. Pretty much every forum on the web mentions Stussy—the Californian surf/street-wear company founded in the 80s. A lot of people seem convinced the symbol was originally a Stussy logo, so I called Stussy. ""No, this is not an original Stussy Logo,"" stated Emmy Coates, who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985. ""I personally get asked this a lot, but people have been drawing this 'S' long before Stussy was established. People have just assumed it was Stussy, and it's sort of spread from there. It's actually quite amusing."" I finally asked Coates what she thought the symbol looked like. ""It looks like Suzuki logo,"" she replied. I was tempted to call Suzuki but didn't. I needed to zoom out and take in the bigger picture, so I got in touch with an expert in symbols and semiotics: Paul Cobley. Cobley is a professor in language and media at Middlesex University in London. According to him, the theory that it was a hair-metal symbol was also ridiculous—""It's certainly not the Saxon logo,"" he said. ""Theirs was far more sharp and had a staff."" Then he offered the most likely yet bland explanation of all. That is, it's fun to draw. ""The reason kids go through this is probably because it's a Moebius strip ,"" he said, referring to the sort of looped one-surface shapes M. C. Escher was fond of drawing. ""It can't be drawn continuously, but it does have a perpetual flow."" Moebius strip. I think he was onto something. Most nine-year-olds can't draw, so when someone hands them a magical recipe to create something fairly cool on demand, that'll go viral. Especially when the shape has the sophisticated, mathematical lineage of a Moebius strip. Yes I'd learned the term ten minutes earlier, but whatever. The ""S"" isn't a Stussy logo or a Superman emblem or a gift from aliens. I think it's just the most fun ever.",it's just the most fun ever

37,"Does student debt derail young people from the American dream of owning a home? That depends on which headline you click. So what’s really going on here? The findings of the two studies don’t exactly contradict — one finds that student loan borrowers say they’re delaying buying a home because of their payments and the other notes that young people with college debt are more likely to buy a home than those who never went to college. But the way the research is framed may change the way we view the results, said Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos, a left-leaning think tank. ""There are important reasons to look at homeownership and what’s happening among young households because it’s still the greatest opportunity to generate wealth that young people have,"" he said. ""But what I find frustrating about the debate around student debt and homeownership is that it looks at only two binary variables: Whether you have student debt and whether you own a home. The debate assumes that if it’s not having an impact on homeownership, it’s not having an impact at all."" It’s hard to deny that the debt is having an impact, given the rising cost of a college degree combined with stagnating wages over the past several years, Huelsman said. Student debt is It’s hard to deny that the debt is having an impact, given the rising cost of a college degree combined with stagnating wages over the past several years, Huelsman said. Student debt is making it more difficult to save for retirement, research from his organization found. Still, he understands where the obsession with student debt on homeownership comes from. ""People tend to look at homeownership as a marker of economic health,"" he said. The idea that student loans may be putting young people at risk of missing such an important economic milestone draws attention in large part because it raises the question as to whether skipping college is a smart financial decision. But it’s not the act of going to college that makes it more difficult to buy a home — it’s the debt. And in fact, for those who complete college, buying a home is easier than for high school graduates, even with the debt that comes with the degree. By age 35, somewhere between 40 and 50% of college graduates own homes, regardless of whether they took on debt to attend school, compared with roughly 30% of those without a degree, a recent The idea that student loans may be putting young people at risk of missing such an important economic milestone draws attention in large part because it raises the question as to whether skipping college is a smart financial decision.

His organization has found that student debt does delay major life decisions like homeownership. ""But for us the resounding answer is no, you should not skip college."" Instead students should be mindful of the cost and the amount they’re borrowing when choosing a school, he said. While today’s college graduates may have a more difficult time saving for a home than their parents and grandparents—who were less likely to have to worry about student loan payments—there are other reasons why they could be delaying homebuying, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist at real estate website, Zillow. Fewer than 40% of Americans under 35 own a home, compared with more than 60% of Americans overall, While today’s college graduates may have a more difficult time saving for a home than their parents and grandparents—who were less likely to have to worry about student loan payments—there are other reasons why they could be delaying homebuying, said Svenja Gudell, the chief economist at real estate website, Zillow. Fewer than 40% of Americans under 35 own a home, compared with more than 60% of Americans overall, according to census data . The average age of first-time home buyers also ticked up over the past several decades; in the 1970s, the median age of a first-time home buyer was 29 or 30, according to Zillow . Today, it’s roughly 32. High rents in major cities mean that many millennials don’t have extra money to put aside, she said. And even those young people who do have the funds set aside may find themselves priced out. ""You’re just having a hard time finding a home that is affordable for millennials, especially in these areas where the job market is going really well,"" Gudell said. ""You see these markets that have a fair amount of good jobs that also have a fair amount of wage growth; their inventory is so tight that you’re having trouble finding an affordable home."" All of this is to say that the financial lives of young people are complicated in part because of student debt and so it’s hard to say exactly why 20-somethings are pushing the goal posts forward on this economic milestone. ""There are so many things going on in terms of how people are building their own family finances to the extent that they can, that to just look at two pieces of that — student debt and the choice to buy a home — it’s incomplete,"" Huelsman said.",student debt does delay major life decisions like homeownership
39,"There are basically two types of drivers: those who get worked up about people driving slowly in the left lane, and those who do it all the time and have no idea they're upsetting everyone else. In case you're in the second group, some background: every state has some sort of law that discourages people from traveling in the left lane on multi-lane roads and highways. It's not that you're never allowed in the left lane, just that you should only use it when necessary, for passing, then get back over. That's because even if you're driving fast, there's always someone going faster. If you promptly get back over after passing, that car will be able to pass you, allowing everyone on the road to get to their destinations as quickly as possible. If you don't, it'll inevitably lead to buildups of traffic and likely raise the chance of accidents. The system works best when people aren't hogging the left lane. That's one reason why National Motorists Association has declared June Lane Courtesy Month in an effort to to raise awareness about the importance of getting out of the left lane. State laws restrict driving in the left lane Every state has some law on the books restricting use of the left lane. In 29 states (shown in yellow), the law says any car that's moving slower than the ""normal speed of traffic"" should be in the right lane — so even if it's going at the speed limit, a car that's not moving as fast as the other cars around shouldn't be in the left. Georgia has increased the penalty for violating this law to a misdemeanor. In 11 states (shown in green), the laws are even stricter — specifically saying the left lane is only for turning or passing. Most of the remaining states say cars need to get over if they're blocking traffic that wants to pass, or if they're traveling more slowly than the speed limit. Police are cracking down on left lane drivers Traditionally, these laws have seldom been enforced, and were often just used as a legal excuse for police to pull people over for unrelated reasons.  Recently, though, police in several states — including Washington, Texas, and Ohio — have increasingly been issuing tickets to people they spot traveling slowly in the left. It impedes traffic and probably makes everyone less safe There's a certain rationale for these laws and enforcement campaigns. When drivers travel in the left lane, it makes the road more congested and probably more dangerous for all parties involved. Research shows that many traffic jams result from a surprisingly small number of slow cars obstructing traffic, with their effects rippling outward. A small buildup of cars that can't pass because someone is driving slowly in the left — right next to another car traveling slowly in the right — is the exact type of scenario that can start this cascade of traffic. Now, some people counter that as long as they're going the speed limit, they don't have to move over — and by slowing down would-be speeders, they're making the roads safer. Apart from the fact that in 44 states, simply going the speed limit doesn't permit drivers to travel in the left lane, this argument doesn't make a lot of sense based on research into how accidents occur. Unfortunately, there isn't much research on the effect of impeding people from passing in the left lane specifically. But there is evidence that slowing down and changing lanes is more dangerous than speeding. Lanes changes account for about four percent of all car accidents in the US, and perhaps as much as ten percent of accidents on highways. Meanwhile, research has generally shown that the strongest predictor of an accident isn't speeding, but variance from the average speed of traffic — and a car going five miles per hour slower than the surrounding traffic has a greater chance of causing an accident than one going five miles per hour faster than it. If relatively slow drivers are scattered among the right and left lanes, faster drivers have to repeatedly slow down and weave back and forth, changing lanes many times to pass all of them. If the slower drivers are all driving in the right lane, a faster driver can pass several at a time, then get back into the right, cutting down on the total number of lane changes and eliminating the slow downs. There's even some evidence that this is why accident and fatality rates are so much lower on the German autobahn, compared to US interstates, even though speed limits are higher (or in some places nonexistent) in Germany. Lane discipline is much more strictly maintained there, allowing drivers to travel more safely at faster speeds.",it'll inevitably lead to buildups of traffic and likely raise the chance of accidents

53,"The first time Bill Clinton proposed to Hillary Rodham was at twilight in England’s romantic Lake District in the spring of 1973. She declined. The couple had recently graduated from Yale Law School and were at a crossroads in their two-year relationship. While the spurned Bill returned home to teach at the University of Arkansas and prepare to run for office, Hillary moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and rented a room near Harvard to study for the bar exam and begin work for Marian Wright Edelman at the Children’s Defense Fund. Hillary loved Bill but could not imagine herself making a life in his home state of Arkansas . Though she had grander ambitions, she still felt pulled in two directions. And then she got a nudge in what proved to be the right direction from an unexpected source: the biggest failure of her young life — one that she kept secret from friends and the public for 30 years, and that would have historic implications as well. The sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was. Like her Rhodes scholar boyfriend, Hillary had been a politically minded overachiever for years. The Illinois native and former Goldwater girl had become a Democrat at Wellesley College during the late 1960s and enjoyed her first taste of national fame when she delivered the commencement address at the school’s graduation — one of several student addresses featured in the June 1969 issue of Life magazine. After Yale, the sky was the limit, or perhaps Arkansas was. As legendary Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein chronicles in A Woman in Charge, there were plenty of reasons for Hillary to avoid Arkansas. For one, moving there would mean she’d likely have to take a teaching job like Bill or work at a local law firm — not exactly her life’s ambition . Her friends thought she was crazy to even consider it, and Bill’s mother, Virginia, who had met Hillary in New Haven, was not a big fan of hers. Bill had always dated flashier women, including a former Miss Arkansas, and Virginia was not convinced that Ms. Rodham was good enough for her son. But after Hillary rejected his proposal in England, Bill was able to talk her into visiting Arkansas that summer ... and into taking the Arkansas bar exam. Still, when Bill and Hillary parted after her brief stay in Arkansas, Bernstein writes, ""their situation seemed totally unsettled."" After sitting for the Arkansas bar exam, Hillary, along with 816 other aspiring lawyers, took the District of Columbia’s bar exam in July 1973. Passing that test was the No. 1 prerequisite to securing a decent legal job in the nation’s capital. Hillary then started her job at the Children’s Defense Fund, which she loved. Living alone in Cambridge, and without Bill, was hard, though. Hillary spent most of her salary, she later admitted, on telephone calls. ""Despite the satisfaction of my work,"" Clinton reflects in her autobiography, Living History, ""I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand."" Then, in early November, Hillary received shocking news: She had failed the D.C. bar exam. A full two-thirds of the test’s takers had passed, many of them with a far less impressive educational pedigree than hers. ""For the first time in her life, she had flamed out,"" writes Bernstein, ""spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her."" The future Mrs. Clinton was hardly the first person, or future leader, to fail a major examination. A Harvard Law School grad, and future first lady, named Michelle Robinson, failed her first attempt to pass the Illinois bar exam. Two future California governors, Pete Wilson and Jerry Brown, fared no better with the California bar. Winston Churchill famously failed the entrance examination to Britain’s elite Sandhurst military academy ... twice. ""[M]y heart was pulling me toward Arkansas,"" Clinton reflects in Living History. ""When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought maybe my test scores were telling me something."" Northeastern University professor Daniel Urman doubts that the failure was a ""deal breaker"" for her move to Arkansas and that Clinton’s reading it as a sign probably stems in part from a ""motivated retelling of history."" Still, it’s hard not to conjecture what turn her life — and history — might have taken had she passed the D.C. exam. A few weeks after the bad news, Bill came to visit Hillary in Boston and the two spent time exploring the city and planning their future. He had rented a small house on 80 secluded acres outside of Fayetteville and was eager for her to join him. Which she did, taking up her own post at the University of Arkansas in 1974 after several months in D.C. working on the Senate’s impeachment inquiry staff tied to the ongoing Watergate scandal. In 1975, she finally said yes to a subsequent proposal from Bill, and the two were married in Fayetteville. Hillary would keep her exam failure hidden, however, even from close friends, for the next three decades until she mentioned it, almost in passing, in Living History. The bottom line, as she would write: ""I knew I was always happier with Bill than without him.""",She had failed the D.C. bar exam.

The Harvard grad sat down with The Guardian's Hadley Freeman to discuss her final farewell to ""Parks And Rec,"" funny women in Hollywood and the ""full princess fantasy."" After allegations of ""slut-shaming"" Hollywood actresses during an October 2013 Twitter debacle, Jones clarified and expanded on her perception of a ""pornification"" of pop culture in a column for Glamour magazine. This week, the actress told The Guardian: ""I'm just asking people to take a breath and talk about it. I also wanted to say there's more than one way to be a woman and be sexy -- like, you're a really great dancer, or you're really f**king smart."" I had the full princess fantasy: the white horse, the whole being saved from my life, which is ridiculous. What do I want to be saved from? My life's great!

I'm happy, but the fact that I'm not married and don't have kids – it's taken me a long time to get to a place where I actually am OK with that, where I actually don't feel like I'm some sort of loser. Jones also discussed her frustration with the value put on marriage as an achievement for women -- and how she overcame the narrative that women can't be happy without it: While Jones has had to defend some of her positions, there's no question she is committed to women's equality -- if not superiority, as she quipped (but seriously though...) to The Conversation in 2013: ""I do think because women are so clever and flexible and such good communicators, it's been hard for men to evolve and keep up. I think we could do a little better to help them out."" We definitely agree that a woman can be sexy in many more ways than just her appearance.

58,"The California city of San Rafael might be one of the more beautiful places in the country, but if you’re a smoker, it might not be the place for you. Last week, the San Francisco suburb made active a smoking ban that officials say is the strictest in the country, prohibiting smoking cigarettes in your own home. The ordinance specifically bans smoking in dwellings that share a wall with another unit, including apartments, duplexes and condominiums. The hope is to eliminate second-hand smoke from creeping through doors and windows, ventilation systems, floorboards and other susceptible openings. According to a U.S. Surgeon General report, secondhand smoke kills about 50,000 Americans per year, including 430 infants. The San Rafael City Council unanimously approved the ban last year. ""I'm not aware of any ordinance that's stronger,"" said Rebecca Woodbury, an analyst at the City Manager’s office, to ABC. ""It doesn't matter if it's owner-occupied or renter-occupied. We didn't want to discriminate. The distinguishing feature is the shared wall."" While California outlawed smoking in bars, clubs and restaurants in 1995, the San Rafael ban is the first to move the restrictions inside the home -- a move that the American Lung Association called ""groundbreaking."" ""This legislation will improve the health of all Californians by reducing exposure to smoke that drifts into housing units from balconies, patios, and other units,"" said the association's president and CEO, Jane Warner. But not everyone celebrated the move. ""This...smoking ban actually intends to punish people for what they do in their own homes,"" said San Rafael resident Thomas Ruppenthal to the council. ""I really feel this is tyranny."" Some housing advocates also spoke out against the ban, claiming that it targeted low-income earners, The Sacramento Bee reported: Brian Augusta, of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, said that targeting multifamily units disproportionately affects low-income people who can't afford standalone homes. ""If smoking is an addiction, and it clearly is, are we telling people that they have to quit smoking - without support - or leave their homes?"" he said. In the same article, Kimberly Amazeen of the American Lung Association offered a rebuttal. ""The real discrimination is against low-income families who can't escape exposure to deadly secondhand smoke,"" she said, ""and they can't find another place to live because of their income or health.""","The ordinance specifically bans smoking in dwellings that share a wall with another unit, including apartments, duplexes and condominiums."

As many as 63% of respondents said their leadership skills are not being fully developed. And it seems to be a key reason behind their willingness to leave: While 71% of those likely to leave in the next two years are dissatisfied with how their leadership skills are being developed, that number drops to 54% among those who are planning to stay beyond 2020. As Punit Renjen, chief executive officer of Deloitte Global, told Bloomberg, young workers' pursuit of leadership skills even at the expense of switching jobs is a new phenomenon. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent trend of flattening organizations, which was highlighted in The Washington Post. In an effort to cut costs, organizations have removed levels of bureaucracy, which means there's not much of a corporate ladder to climb anymore. ""The biggest driver of disengagement is people feeling like they're stuck in a job, and there's nothing for them there,"" one expert told The Post. ""It's easier to quit your company and find a new job than find a new job within your own company."" Restoring some semblance of a corporate ladder may require a good deal of structural reorganization. In the meantime, managers can take small steps to help their employees develop into leadership positions. The Wall Street Journal recommends creating mentoring programs in which workers are paired with more senior employees at their company. You can also rotate your employees through different jobs, so they gain new knowledge and expertise. As for individual employees, US News & World Report suggests being proactive instead of waiting for a leadership position to open up. If you work for a large company, you can speak to someone in human resources and ask what you should be learning to reach the next level. You can also volunteer to take charge of a particular project, so that management recognizes your capabilities.",Insufficient opportunities to develop their leadership skills.
66,"One often discussed question is whether it’s better to keep your laptop plugged in, or if you should use it on battery power. Turns out, the answer isn’t entirely straightforward. Let’s take a look. Know Your Laptop Battery For both types of batteries, the following statements are true (for modern laptops ): A battery cannot be overcharged. There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. There’s no danger of a battery being overcharged if you leave it plugged in all the time. As soon as it hits 100%, it will cease charging and won’t start again until the voltage falls below a certain level. Fully discharging a battery will damage it. Having a battery fully discharged for an extended period can put it into a deep discharge state, from which it might never recover. So, based on this, do we conclude that you should simply leave your laptop plugged in all the time? Not quite. Things That Damage Lithium Batteries Charge/discharge cycles. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Every battery has a finite number of times it can be charged and discharged. Voltage level. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life. The higher the charge level (measured in volts per cell), the shorter the battery’s life. High temperature, over 30 degrees celsius. This can cause irreparable damage. Charge Level Lithium-ion batteries charge to 4.20V/cell, which amounts to 100% of its capacity. At this level, the battery will have a lifespan of 300-500 discharge cycles. Every 0.10V/cell reduction in the charge doubles the number of discharge cycles, until the optimum is reached: 3.92V/cell, with 2400-4000 discharge cycles. Unfortunately, at this level the battery is only 58% charged, so the runtime will be little more than half of a fully-charged battery. Heat And then there’s heat. Elevated temperatures, typically classified as being over 30 degrees celsius, will shorten the life of a battery irrespective of any other factors. Simply leaving your laptop in your car on a summer’s afternoon is a bad idea. When the stress of high temperature combines with the stress of high voltage, the effects are even greater. The Battery University tests showed that a battery stored with a 40% charge at 40 degrees would see its capacity fall to 85% after a year. Charged to 100% the capacity falls to 65% under the same conditions. For a fully charged battery at 60 degrees the capacity plummets to 60% in just three months. The evidence seems clear. Keeping the battery permanently charged at 100% will slowly shorten its life. Keeping it at 100% and exposing it to high temperatures will shorten it much quicker. Should You Remove The Battery? If heat is such a danger, it begs another question. Should you remove the battery altogether when using your laptop on AC power? If you do choose to remove the battery, ensure that you store it properly. This means charged to between 40% and 70%, and kept at room temperature. Recommendations Curiously, the industry as a whole doesn’t seem to have settled on a single answer for the question about whether to use your laptop on AC or battery power. Apple’s advice is no longer on its website, but you can still read it online . The company recommends against leaving a laptop plugged in all the time. Instead, it suggests: An ideal user would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing Leaving your laptop plugged in will not cause short term damage, but if you only ever use it on AC power you’ll almost certainly find that after a year the battery’s capacity has been significantly reduced. Similarly, if you only ever use it on battery power you’ll get through the battery’s discharge cycles quicker. So, the best solution is something of a compromise between the two: use it on battery power some days, and keep it plugged in on others. And in all cases, you’ll want to ensure it doesn’t get too hot. How do you use your laptop? What steps do you take to keep your battery lasting for as long as possible? Let us know in the comments.

68,"You know orange juice has a lot of sugar -- 21 grams in one small cup -- but is it worse than a cola? 1. The dark secret in your glass of sunshine. When fruit is stripped of its skin, pulp, flesh and other fibrous parts, it's distilled down to its sweet essence. That means that orange juice has roughly the same amount of sugar as the demon of the nutritional world, soda -- about 5 to 8 teaspoons per cup. Add to this: the sugar in pure, natural juice and the sugar in sugar-sweetened beverages are both densely packed with calories, say Naveed Sattar, MD, PhD, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. In a recent article in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal, Sattar points out that eating whole fruit is associated with a reduced (or neutral) risk of diabetes, but drinking fruit juice is associated with an increased risk. 2. The cold truth. The marquee vitamin in orange juice, vitamin C, is good for your immune system, and it's an antioxidant that protects cells from free radicals. But some of its benefits are overrated: No studies have been able to conclude that vitamin C helps cure colds. Further, you may not realize that the information on the label of your store-bought juice (even not-from-concentrate brands) refers to the amount of vitamin C that was present when the product was packaged, explains Alissa Hamilton, PhD, a former Food and Society Policy Fellow with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the author of Squeezed: What You Don't Know About Orange Juice. All juice loses nutrients over time (that's why the people at the juice bar urge you to drink their blends ASAP), and modern storage technology has radically extended the shelf life of mass-market juices. For example, today’s more efficient mode of storage is to strip the liquid of oxygen and then keep it in million-gallon tanks. The juice can remain in those tanks for upwards of a year. Then after it goes into the carton, it can sit on a truck, in a supermarket, and in your fridge, steadily losing vitamins. 3. The hidden extras. When juice is processed and treated for storage, it inevitably loses flavor. To remedy this, Hamilton says that big juice manufacturers work with chemical companies to come up with ""flavor packs"" that make the juice taste like the beverage we know and love -- those are added to the juice before it's packaged for sale. The chemicals in the flavor packs are essences and oils found naturally in oranges, but they don't necessarily come from the same oranges that are in that carton of juice. Hamilton discovered that some of the flavor-makers are known to source their ingredients from countries like Brazil, which has different restrictions and pesticide controls than we have in the U.S. 4. The juicy conclusion: With its links to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and gout and its utter lack of nutrients, soda is still worse for you than orange juice. The problem comes when non-soda drinkers swap out all their fruit or water for juice, an increasingly common diet habit. ""People know that soda is bad for them, but I had one patients in my clinic drinking 2 liters of orange juice a day thinking he was getting all these health benefits, all while gaining weight, causing liver problems and increasing his risk of diabetes,"" says Sattar. He urges people to drink fruit juice sparingly.","juice has roughly the same amount of sugar as the demon of the nutritional world, soda"
70,"The smiling poop's ability to transcend language barriers and political differences has seen it become one of the most popular emojis in existence, writes Samantha Selinger-Morris. And its ineffable charm resonates in surprisingly profound ways. It may sound like a situation ripped from an old Seinfeld script, but it's a social quandary most of us have struggled with, fruitlessly. It's Christmas, you dip your hand into a hat to select the name of the person to whom you must give a Kris Kringle gift, only to discover it's the office snitch. What can you give them that will convey your distaste, but without you ending up being yanked into the Human Resources office? Last week, Sydney baker Andres Fatso offered up what she thinks will be the perfect solution: smiling poop emoji cupcakes. ""You know, [you think], 'You're a little shit sometimes',"" says Ms Fatso, who posted an image of her chocolate cupcakes — massive chocolate icing swirl on top, to resemble the poop, with white and black candy eyes and a smile — on Instagram, where she has more than 35,000 followers. ""I'm going to give you a shit emoji.'"" Until fairly recently, one could safely assume that any ""gift"" involving faeces would likely be reciprocated with a slap in the face, or the accusation that you have the emotional maturity of a four-year-old. But in the past 12 months, the smiling poop emoji has become an unexpectedly beloved icon, among both the young and the not-so-young. Its ability to ease uncomfortable social interactions — from discussing opposing political opinions to admitting first-world guilt — has seen it proliferate, well, almost everywhere. Artisans on Etsy now offer everything from earrings to buttons and slippers in the shape of the emoji. In July, music lovers at the Splendour in the Grass music festival, near Byron Bay, flocked to sit in a giant inflatable smiling pink poop emoji tent, created by a Spanish art collective. (In it, guests were treated to — you guessed it — soft serve chocolate ice-cream that resembles the emoji.) In September, Indian actress Deepika Padukone was featured in a Vanity Fair magazine spread of hot young talents in which she declared that her most ""overused emoji"" was the smiling poop. And earlier this year, a couple in Western Australia transformed a termite mound, off the side of a highway they frequently travel on, into a smiling poop emoji, with giant accessories from Kmart. ""The poop emoji is just the most flexible of all the characters out there,"" says Jeremy Burge, the Australian founder of Emojipedia (a Wikipedia for emojis). He says it is currently one of the most popular of all the approximately 2,000 emojis in existence, and that he sees it regularly, in the form of a throw cushion, being sold in Tube stations in London, England, where he currently lives. ""It's a mixed meaning. It's smiling, so it's happy, but it's poop,"" Mr Burge says. ""You could [mean, by using it], 'This is great'. But, more to the point, you could use it anywhere, and people don't quite know what you mean by it. You can use it in any context."" For Lisa Williams, the Torquay-based owner of an Etsy boutique that sells an inflatable foil smiling poop emoji balloon, the emoji is the perfect way to communicate to friends that most modern of messages — that something is a ""first world problem"". ""If something was a bit crappy, we would use it [in a text], in a joking way; you know, 'We're all fairly lucky, nothing in our lives is that bad',"" says Ms Williams, 38. It meets an entirely different need for the children and tweens who buy the balloon, however: ""They can sort of say, 'shit', with their poo emoji, without having to use the language, or get in trouble."" The emoji similarly enables grown-ups to dodge censorship, says Dr Pauline Bryant, a visiting fellow in the Linguistics Program at the Australian National University, because we can express ""disgust, dislike, disapproval, without having to actually spell out words that might actually get blocked by a [computer] filter"". ""And there is so much going on in the world that needs a comment like a poo emoji. Political things, and, generally, the state of the world,"" she says. Indeed, although the emoji was first introduced in 2010, it surged in popularity in the last year, thanks in part to the contentious American presidential election. Last month, a hacker placed a smiling poop emoji on the front page of American president-elect Donald Trump's website. It was pulled down quickly, presumably by Mr Trump's staff, but not before the Internet exploded with gleeful headlines. (""Someone took a shit on Donald Trump's website; Great job, Internet!"" wrote entertainment website AV Club.) Earlier this year, both Democrats and Republicans rejoiced at the launch of Politicians To Poop, a Chrome browser extension that allows computer users to ""poopify"" the names of both presidential candidates, by replacing all mention of them with the smiling poop emoji. As online technology magazine CNet.com, put it: ""The smiling poop emoji is the hero the US deserves."" And, adds Dr Bryant, the poop emoji is also useful for helping people discuss dissenting political opinions with loved ones, in a text or email, without upsetting them. ""How can you be mad, or offended, by an emoji that actually looks like soft serve ice cream with big eyes and a smile?"" she says. The idea of excrement being co-opted to enable the discussion of serious topics can seem counterintuitive. But emojis, in general, have been gaining legitimacy. Oxford Dictionaries declared — for the first time ever — that the ""word of the year"" for 2015 was a pictograph (the ""Face with Tears Emoji""). Meanwhile, classic texts like the Bible, and Moby Dick, have been translated into emoji. And the smiling poop emoji, in particular, was used last year by a serious charity. Water Aid, which raises funds to provide clean water and toilets to the 2.4 billion people who lack them, launched its #GiveAShit campaign, with the poop emoji at its centre. The charity enlisted celebrities to post a customized smiling poop emoji that resembled them, to their Instagram accounts. (""Isn't it uncanny?"" actor Allan Cumming wrote, on Instagram, of his poop, which sported round black spectacles and a swoop of grey hair.) This isn't to say that the emoji is entirely unproblematic. Someone — presumably a critic — tore down the Western Australian smiling poop emoji termite mound after a week. And, by combining symbols that convey disgust and glee, the emoji can lead to confusion. Mr Burge recalls being texted a variety of emojis — including the dancing girl, the smiley face, and the smiling poop — after a night out with friends. ""You kind of go, 'Was that just telling a story about what happened?' You don't really know what they mean by that. Did anything go wrong?"" he says. Still, for many others, the emoji has an ineffable charm that resonates in surprisingly profound ways. ""If that poop's not happy, why are you not happy?"" said my eight-year-old daughter, when I asked her why the emoji was so popular. (Rainn Wilson, the star of the American version of the TV show The Office, feels the same, tweeting in July: ""He's a pile of poo but he still has a smile on his face. He's hanging in there. So can you!"") ""It is deep, if you think about it,"" says Ms Fatso, the baker, who is also a full-time nurse. She says the smiling poop always puts a smile on her face, and is a welcome contrast to the suffering she sees almost daily. And, she adds, giving a smiling poop emoji to someone you don't like — in any form — could even shift the relationship in a new, positive direction. ""It could really turn that relationship around. [The other person] might think, 'They've got humour! They're happy to call me a shit, and they can be honest and up front about it.""",Its ability to ease uncomfortable social interactions
82,"USA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills ""During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza. ""The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder. ""Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. ""That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company... which has been around since my grandfather,"" he said. ""Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will ""protect your job."" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades – and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. ""At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. ""Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages. ""In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens – filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work – since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing. ""The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.""","Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will ""protect your job.""

85,"Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong Schools are reaching a crisis point. By 2025 there will be 3 million pupils of secondary school age, but not enough young people are choosing to become teachers themselves. Teacher training places are going unfilled. Early last September, half of places on some such courses were sitting empty with just days to go before classes began. Government recruitment targets have been missed in the majority of subjects, including physics (by 19 per cent) and mathematics (by 16 per cent). Design and Technology only reached 41 per cent of its recruitment target this year. Meanwhile we’re shedding existing teachers from our schools at record rates: 10,000 departed the profession between 2010 and 2015, and the pace of that loss is speeding up as disillusionment grows. Another £3bn cut to budgets is anticipated in the coming years – likely to be confirmed in Philip Hammond’s Budget next month – meaning that spending will reduce by 8 per cent per secondary pupil within the next three years. In short, there simply aren’t enough teachers to educate our young people and it’s a crisis that is entirely politically manufactured. Three years ago, half of teachers said they were considering leaving the profession. At that point, as well as dealing with a spiralling workload, they were also being insulted each morning on the radio, in the press or in parliament by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove. The very man who should have been fighting their corner in an age of cutbacks instead spent his days inventing some very creative names for teachers: ""the blob"", the ""enemies of promise"", ""soft bigots"" with ""low expectations"". Gove was later replaced by Nicky Morgan, who, instead of repairing fractured relations, sought to rub salt into the glistening wounds. She accused teachers of ""doing battle"" unnecessarily with the Government and ""doing down the profession they represent in the process"". And, when similar research was carried out last year, nothing had improved. MPs picked apart the result of all this mud-slinging this week: ""As the population grows, efforts to recruit and retain good quality teachers become even more critical,"" they warned. ""While recruiting sufficient new teachers is, of course, necessary, the Government should place greater emphasis on improving teacher retention ... Not only is this a more cost-effective way to tackle some of the issues, but more teachers staying in the profession for longer would strengthen the pool of leadership positions."" But why would anyone want to put in the hours (60+ per week, of which less than half is actually spent in the classroom teaching children) to build their career to leadership level when the Government pig-headedly refuses to do the one thing that would actually help solve this problem: listen to teachers, and acknowledge what they are saying? Teachers aren’t uniquely sensitive creatures; they are experts in their field and, by voting with their feet and leaving their vocation, they are sending a warning to the Government that something is seriously wrong. And it’s easy to discover what, because they have been talking about it openly for years. First, there’s the unreasonable workload. That, as teachers themselves have pointed out, is not exclusive to their profession. However, in teaching, the weight of the workload is compounded by data-gathering, form-filling, or any of the other myriad examples of endless bureaucracy that the Government requires in their futile efforts to continuously compare one school with another. Then there’s the apparent ignorance from the Government of what teachers are actually trying to achieve. As one former teacher, Zoe Brown, who quit last year, told The Independent: ""In some ways I don’t feel like a teacher at all anymore. I prepare children for tests and, if I’m honest, I do it quite well. It’s not something I’m particularly proud of, as it’s not as if I have provided my class with any transferable, real-life skills during the process. They’ve not enjoyed it, I’ve not enjoyed it, but we’ve done it: one thing my children know how to do is answer test questions."" On top of that, there are ideological concerns for some about the forced academisation programme, which gives businesses influence over young people; the truly chilling effect of year-on-year pay freezes (the clue’s in the name); and an enforced increase in employee contributions to pension plans which make even experienced teachers worse off year-by-year. Little wonder they are looking for alternatives in the jobs market. Of course, not all teachers who are considering leaving within the next five years will go through with that threat. ""Considering leaving"" teaching may also mean weighing up the remaining benefits against the drawbacks of starting over in another line of work. The pay in teaching may not seem competitive when compared to other graduate roles, but the 12 weeks’ paid holiday a year is some recompense; it may sound like a virtual nirvana for others trapped in an unfulfilling role with just quarter of that annual allowance of time to oneself. Yet the MPs are right to set off a flare: with Brexit fast approaching, immigration can no longer be relied upon to fill teaching gaps. Important subjects such as technology and the sciences are being neglected in our schools as specialist teaching posts sit vacant – many in the very disciplines that will create the jobs of the future, in a high-tech economy. Ministers play fast and loose with the carrots – attractive bursaries to train, higher pay and debt write-offs for new teachers entering in-demand subjects – while appearing oblivious to all the sticks they are throwing at the same time. Teaching must be made more attractive. MPs have some interesting ideas on how to achieve this, such as capping the number of hours outside the classroom that teachers are expected to work, but there’s no need for complicated brainstorming sessions. The simplest thing that the Government could do to make education a more enticing career is to simply open their ears.","At that point, as well as dealing with a spiralling workload, they were also being insulted each morning on the radio, in the press or in parliament by the then Education Secretary Michael Gove."
86,"A warning that the game would no longer be supported in unlocked, rooted or jail-broken devices was already given by Niantic before the latest Pokemon Go update. However, some of the players didn’t seem impressed with this decision. A message, which reads, ""This device, OS, or software is not compatible with Pokémon Go,"" are shown in the jailbroken phones. The players who are facing this issue are now asking for their money back. A Reddit post , made by a user in this regard was highly upvoted. The user mentioned about his experience with the Google customer service while he tried to get the refund for his Pokemon Go in-app purchases. GnothiSeauton, the creator of the original post said, ""I wouldn’t have had a problem with [the update booting jailbroken/rooted/unlocked phones] if they blocked rooted users from launch."" ""However, doing it 2 months into the [game] show after rooted users have invested time and money into the game, is completely unscrupulous,"" he added. There is only a little hope for the players who spent money on Pokemon Go to get back their money by using this type of protest. Niantic has taken this strict step to decrease cheating in the game, which is obviously understandable. However, some of the players think that rooting the phone is no crime as many people roots their Android devices to make them more customizable. On the other hand, there are also people who buy unlocked phone to avoid some extra charges. Some workarounds for the Android users facing this issue has come up on various gaming websites and forums. One of such popular method is to install another program in the phone which can give you back the access to the game. Pokemon Go is back on track with the release of the Buddy update, after the drastic downfall it had seen over the course of the last month. However, players facing this type of issues can hamper the game once again. It’ll be better for Niantic if they sort out something soon in this matter.","game would no longer be supported in unlocked, rooted or jail-broken devices"
90,"""Bigorexia"" is on the rise—male body standards have changed drastically since superheroes looked like George Reeves Do you want a body like a Marvel superhero? Be prepared to eat—a lot. In a recent interview with BuzzFeed, Chris Hemsworth’s stunt double, Bobby Holland Hanton, told the outlet that he has to eat 35 times a day to ""anywhere near [Hemsworth’s] size."" Henton, who claims that he also worked out twice a day to stay in superhero shape, previously told Muscle and Fitness that his high protein diet (which consisted of turkey, chicken, nuts, eggs, and spinach) was a massive impediment to having a healthy social life: ""It made me kind of unsociable in a way because you can’t go out with friends or family because you’re picking what you can and can’t in the menu. ... It was a big challenge for me."" Hanton’s interview illustrates the extreme pressures that men face to be as fit and as big as humanly possible. Following the success of ""The Avengers,"" and most recently ""Captain America: Civil War,"" a number of workout and diet regimens promise to help men look like Thor, Hawkeye, and the Captain (in as little as six weeks!). These routines have become so widespread that as Muscle and Fitness reports, they are arguably more popular than the actors who popularized them: ""The physique he built has made ‘Chris Hemsworth Workout’ the top search suggestion when you punch the actor’s name into Google."" There are several different Marvel-themed programs that will help men seeking maximum muscularity achieve their fitness goals, many of which are prohibitively expensive. If the USDA estimated in 2016 that the average adult male aged 19-50 spends around $69.80 every week on food, that’s based on the expectation that these men eat around three meals a day—with perhaps a snack in between. Hanton eats 10 times that amount, meaning that a fitness enthusiast hoping to keep pace with his diet would spend $698 a week to do so. That comes out to $36,000 a year. (To clarify: That's a top-end estimate it's possible Hanton is not eating full meals every time he eats.) That’s not even adding in the costs of paid programs like CrossFit, which commonly set members back around $200 each month. In addition to the cost, there are a number of dangers to the Marvel plan. The first is overexertion: As Time reported in February of last year, working out too much can actually be just as harmful for one’s health as working out too little. Researchers in Denmark found that ""people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise."" In the case of Gerard Butler, the famously grueling workout he was subjected to for ""300"" stopped him from exercising at all after the movie wrapped he quit working out for a year. In a 2007 interview with Film Monthly, the Scottish actor claimed that he would never make the choice to put his body through that again. Extreme fitness programs can be dangerous in a variety of ways: They are bad for your body, decrease life expectancy, and are associated with a high rate of injury. As fitness instructor Erin Simmons argued in a 2014 article on CrossFit, crash exercising can be a gift to doctors because it ""means job security for medical professionals."" Simmons spoke with a number of ""strength and conditioning coaches"" about the rise of regimes like CrossFit and ""not a single one of them"" would recommend it. She continues, ""These same athletic trainers warn every single athlete against CrossFit and tell them the health risks of being involved in it."" With the extreme risks and financial burden associated with looking like Steve Rogers, it’s worth asking: Is this emphasis on getting big at all costs making us any happier? In 2015, a BBC report noted that ""bigorexia"" (more accurately known as ""muscle dysphoria"") is on the rise in young men. Rob Willson, who serves as the president of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation, told the BBC: ""We know about 10 percent of men in the gym may have muscle dysmorphia."" Dr. Michele Kerulis of Adler School of Professional Psychology told The Daily Mail that rate may be even higher: She claimed as many as 45 percent of frequent male gym goers male suffer from disordered body image. That estimate seems very high, but it’s impossible to ignore the fact that male body standards have changed dramatically since Superman looked like George Reeves, rather than a human action figure. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to build muscle mass or be fit, but it’s worth remembering that there’s a reason Chris Hemsworth has the ability to look like a Norse God: He’s paid to. He has the luxury to spend absurdly long hours in the gym because it is his job. For the rest of us, attempting to live our lives by those same standards isn’t just impossible. It might be killing us.","Extreme fitness programs can be dangerous in a variety of ways: They are bad for your body, decrease life expectancy, and are associated with a high rate of injury."

By combining the best features from a backpack, duffel bag and general luggage, we have created the ultimate travel bag to help you spend less time fussing with your luggage and more time enjoying your journey. The NOMATIC Travel Bag has over 20 features that make it the most functional travel bag ever. On top of being packed with incredible functionality, the bag has a sleek minimalist design, is made of strong weather-proof materials and is built to last. Our Innovative strap system allows you to switch between backpack and duffel in seconds and have no dangling straps. The NOMATIC Vacuum Bag is included with every travel set and is both water proof and air tight. This added feature will help you pack all you need in half the space, leaving more room for other travel essentials. In addition to the vacuum bag, a laundry bag comes with each travel bag to complete the set. When closed, the laundry bag was designed to fit perfectly inside the door of the shoe compartment of your travel bag. When you arrive at your destination, the laundry bag expands and hangs on a door knob so you can easily toss dirty clothes in. When the trip is over and the laundry bag is full, it will fit back into your travel bag perfectly and keep your dirty clothes separate and organized. The NOMATIC Travel Bag is equipped with an RFID safe pocket and a TSA approved lock. This ""mini safe"" keeps your scannable and valuable items safe during travel from pickpockets, room service, and other potential threats. Perfect place to safely travel with valuables and RFID scannable items. TSA Approved lock included. The padded and secure laptop pocket allows you to leave your backpack or laptop bag behind and travel like a pro with just one bag. The laptop pocket can hold a 15"" laptop comfortably. Plus with the airport security friendly design, you won't have to take your laptop out of the pocket. Just open the bag and lay the main compartment door flat (as shown in the second image below) and you will be good to go. Keep your tablet accessible and safe in this easy access padded pocket found on the inside of the main compartment door. The secure velcro flap was designed with a slot to allow you to charge your tablet on the go with a power bank while keeping it secure. Located at the top of the bag is a water bottle pocket lined with a water proof material to allow you to stay hydrated on the road while keeping all of your belongings dry in case of a leak. If you travel with a roller bag, The NOMATIC Travel Bag will be the perfect companion. We have designed a built in durable sleeve to fit over the handle of your roller bag. The exterior of the NOMATIC Travel Bag is a durable 100% water-proof tarpaulin material. Tarpaulin is commonly used on rugged outdoor bags because of its ability to endure and stay strong in harsh conditions. We have also integrated waterproof zippers into the exterior of the bag to keep your gear protected in the rain and snow. This bag features a large opening into the main compartment which gives you easy access and visibility for packing. The shoe, socks, and underwear compartments help you to stay organized. In addition, the strong tarpaulin material holds its shape to make packing easier. Put 1 or 2 pairs of shoes in the shoe compartment, and socks, underwear or a light jacket in the upper compartment, and still have plenty of room for everything else. On the bottom of the bag we have included a shoe compartment where you can easily fit up to two pairs of shoes. (2 pairs of U.S. size 12 fit comfortably inside) On the top of the bag is a similar compartment to the shoe compartment where you can keep socks, underwear, or even a light jacket for easy access when you get cold while traveling. These compartments were designed to help you organize your packing rather than just stuffing everything into one big pocket like most duffel bags. At 21"" x 14"" x 9"" inches this bag meets domestic and international carry-on standards. Keep your phone, sunglasses, and other valuables protected in this soft fleece-lined pocket on the top side of the bag. With this combination of mesh, fleece-lined, and zipper pockets, you can keep your cords, power banks, laptop chargers and any other odds and ends right where you need them. The side pocket is sized to hold a BASICS Notebook or any other book of a similar size (roughly 5.5"" x 8.75"") When the bag is worn in backpack mode, this pocket is easily accessible, making it the perfect place for frequently needed travel documents. Also, because it is positioned with the zipper close to your back it makes it more difficult for pickpockets to access this zipper undetected. Carrying your luggage can become painful and heavy, so we added a very comfortable handle to make your interactions with the bag as enjoyable as possible. Last but not least we have added a sternum strap for added comfort and support. The following three accessories are designed to fit perfectly inside the bag and to match the design of the bag to create the perfect travel kit. However, in order to simplify the ordering process on Kickstarter these products will not be available for order until after our Kickstarter campaign ends, but they will ship with the travel bag. Toiletries bag Made from the same Tarpaulin material as the Travel Bag, this toiletries bag will last forever and will keep liquid spill inside the toiletries bag and away from your clothes. Waist Strap To give you better support when carrying the bag, you can clip on these waist straps to distribute the weight more comfortably. Also each strap has a pocket big enough to hold your passport for even more functionality. Shoe bag In case you want to keep your dirty shoes away from other items or want to keep other items away from your shoes, this shoe bag is perfect for the job. Shirt Organizer Using the plastic guide that comes with this accessory, you can fold your shirts to just the right size, then store them in the organizer to avoid wrinkles while traveling. We are confident that we can deliver all NOMATIC Travel Set rewards by January 2017. Marketing The marketing for this campaign has been performed by two different marketing agencies. The first being Matix Labs which ran throughout the entire duration of the campaign. The other was Funded Today which performed their marketing efforts from August 11th to September 1st.

102,"The chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review evidence that Lois Lerner ""broke the law to target Americans for their political beliefs."" The request comes after the DOJ refused, under the Obama Administration’s leadership, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the former IRS Exempt Organizations Division director. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX), joined by Tax Police Subcommittee Chairman Peter Roskam (R-IL), sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting an investigation into allegations that Lerner used her division’s power to target American citizens’ applications for non-profit status, or political action committees, based upon the citizen’s political beliefs. ""Taxpayers deserve to know that the DOJ’s previous evaluation was not tainted by politics,"" the two chairmen wrote in the letter obtained by Breitbart Texas. ""We respectfully request the Department of Justice to take a fresh look at the evidence presented in the attached referral in order to restore taxpayers’ trust in the IRS."" Brady and Roskam sent information to the U.S. Attorney General disclosing findings of a three-year investigation by their committee that uncovered ""evidence of willful misconduct on the part of Ms. Lerner."" ""Despite this fact, and for what many believe were purely partisan reasons, the prior Administration refused to review Ms. Lerner’s misconduct,"" they explained. ""In particular, the Committee found that Ms. Lerner used her position to improperly influence IRS action against conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law."" ""The Committee also found she impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,"" the letter to Sessions continues. ""Finally, Lerner risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of Internal Revenue Code section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business."" In August 2016, Breitbart News reported that the House voted to hold Lerner in Contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify before a House Oversight Committee hearing in May 2013. The article disclosed information contained in 302 FBI documents revealing possible illegal conduct by Lerner and others in the IRS. Commenting on Obama’s Justice Department’s failure to take action, the letter from the two tax chairmen states, ""Disturbingly, in February 2014, while the investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) was ongoing, President Obama stated there was ‘not a smidgeon of corruption’ at the IRS, preempting a fair investigation in which he had political equities."" In April 2014, the Ways and Means Committee posted a timeline of Lerner’s alleged misconduct while serving in the IRS: January 21, 2010: Citizen’s United Ruling:  Supreme Court issues ruling in Citizens United case, which would lead to an active campaign by Democrats against conservative groups – a campaign Lerner was well aware of and reacted to. January 27, 2010: President Obama Goes on the Attack:  In his State of the Union address, President Obama states: ""With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections.  I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."" March-April 2010: IRS Targeting Begins:  According to TIGTA, the IRS’s Determinations Unit ""began searching for other requests for exemption involving the Tea Party, Patriots, 9/12 and IRC § 501(c)(4) applications involving political sounding names, e.g., ‘We the People’ or ‘Take Back the Country.’"" September 26, 2010: White House Steps Up Attacks:  David Axelrod, then-senior advisor to President Obama, referred to Crossroads GPS and similar groups as ""front groups for special interests. These are front groups for foreign-controlled companies, which would have been banned under the bill that we put through Congress, and they don’t want the American people to know, and the American people ought to be alert to that."" October 12, 2010: Democrat Leaders Join Attack:  Assistant Majority Leader Dick Durbin urges the IRS to investigate the tax status of Crossroads GPS and ""other orgs"" – though no other organizations were named. October 19, 2010: Lerner on Alert:  Speaking to students at Duke University, Lois Lerner states that 501(c)(4) organizations were spending money on campaign activity in the wake of the Citizens United decision and claimed, ""[E]verybody is screaming at us, ‘fix it now before the election...."" February 2011: Lerner Calls Conservatives ""Dangerous,"" Start to Take Control:  Lois Lerner sends email to IRS employees ""Tea Party Matter very dangerous ....Cincy should probably NOT have these cases."" March 24, 2011: Democrats Step Up Attacks:  DCCC launches website to ""expose donors of Crossroads GPS."" June 3, 2011:    Congressional Inquiries Begin: Chairman Camp sends letter to Commissioner Shulman inquiring about IRS targeting of taxpayers who donated money to conservative groups, as well as information regarding audits of 501(c)(4) organizations. June 19, 2012: White House Continues to Attack:  President Obama’s lawyer demands that Crossroads GPS disclose its donors, saying in a complaint to the Federal Election Commission that the group is plainly a ""political committee"" subject to federal reporting requirements. February 1, 2012: Democrats Continue to Attack:  National Public Radio reports that Senate Democrats, led by Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), want to investigate groups such as Crossroads GPS. July 10, 2012: Lerner’s Mindset Revealed:  Lois Lerner, in response to a story sent to her regarding the complaint to the FEC against Crossroads GPS replies ""Perhaps the FEC will save the day."" July 17, 2012: Lerner Starts to Prepare Cover Story: Lerner sent an email to Holly Paz and Nikole Flax offering comments on a talking point that referred to an ""uptick in political advocacy cases,"" drafted for then-Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Steve Miller.  However, Lerner admits that, ""I know we don’t have published SOI stats"" to support such a claim."" [See letter to DOJ] July 27, 2012: Democrats Attack, Again:  Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) sends another letter to the IRS regarding Crossroads GPS and others, seeking a probe and status. December 14, 2012: IRS Leaks:  Crossroads GPS’s application is leaked to ProPublica, though the tax-exempt status of the group had not been determined, a violation of federal law. November 2, 2012: Lerner Misleads TIGTA: Lerner sends misleading response to TIGTA investigatory audit questionnaire. [See letter to DOJ] January 4, 2013: Lerner Leaps Into Action:  Lerner organizes a meeting with Democracy 21 and also with the Office of Chief Counsel and the Office of Tax Policy at the Department of the Treasury for January 4.  This begins a series of specific actions by Lerner that targets only conservative groups. [See letter to DOJ] January 4, 2013: Lerner Pressures Review Committee:  Lerner inquires to the status of Crossroads, and finds that the group had not been selected for audit.  She subsequently sent an email to the Director of Examinations in Dallas, TX, Nanette Downing, demanding to know why the group had not yet been audited.  In her email to Downing, she notes that she wants all moves regarding Crossroads to be coordinated in DC. [See letter to DOJ] January 24, 2013: Lerner Ponders Job for Obama Organization: In response to a news story about the formation of the President’s Organizing For Action, a 501(c)(4), Lerner remarked to EO Senior Technical Advisor Sharon Light, ""Oh—maybe I can get the DC office job!"" [See letter to DOJ] January 31, 2013: Lerner Attempts to Influence Independent Appeals Process:  In an email to the Chief of IRS Appeals, Chris Wagner, Lerner offers unsolicited advice on the independent appeals process notwithstanding a prohibition against such contact. [See letter to DOJ] May 10, 2013: Lerner Misleads Public:  At an American Bar Association function, Lois Lerner, director of the IRS’s Exempt Organizations Division, publicly apologizes for what she claimed were inappropriate actions by the Cincinnati office of the IRS to subject conservative groups to extra scrutiny. Despite the lengthy report from the Ways and Means Committee, the DOJ took no action. ""It is clear that when the DOJ announced in October 2015 that it would not bring charges against Lois Lerner, the agency was following President Obama’s signal on how he wanted the investigation to be handled,"" Brady and Roskam concluded in this new letter to the DOJ. The two committee chairman requested a new investigation to look into the matter in order to ""restore taxpayers’ trust in the IRS.""","The chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review evidence that Lois Lerner ""broke the law to target Americans for their political beliefs."""
107,"A man looking to blame President-Elect Donald Trump supporters for a hate crime confessed to police that he fabricated an incident involving a racially-charged message, a fire, and a staged abduction. Vincent Palmer, 27, told local police in Volusia County, Florida that he wrote a message using racial slurs with with ""KKK"" and ""Trump"" references taped to his ex-girlfriend’s car just before throwing a brick through the back window–dousing it in gasoline and setting it ablaze, the Orlando Sentinel reported. When the woman found her car, she called the police and Palmer came to the scene–though officers noted he was acting suspicious. Responding officers checked Palmer’s record, finding that he had an outstanding arrest for failing to pay child support. Palmer was subsequently arrested and later released on bail. The next morning, a relative of Palmer’s called Daytona Police after they received a note apparently written in blood saying, ""You will never see your grandson again alive,"" with the same letters ""KKK"" included in the message. When police went looking for Palmer, they found him at a nearby Burger King, where he confessed to fabricating the original hate hoax and his own abduction, saying the blood on the note was actually his own. Palmer is being held by police on alleged arson charges.","A man looking to blame President-Elect Donald Trump supporters for a hate crime confessed to police that he fabricated an incident involving a racially-charged message, a fire, and a staged abduction."
114,"Since April, Facebook is suffering what they reportedly refer to as ‘context collapse’, with users sharing less personal information on the website.  Despite that, the information you have already made available may make you the recipient of targeted advertising.  Since September ProPublica collected over 52,000 unique attributes Facebook uses to classify its customers, by using data about categories of interest provided by users.   Facebook gathers information about its users from a variety of sources – openly available and collected by third parties. What isn’t well known, however, is that commercial data brokers compile records about the way Facebook users behave in the real world – including favourite restaurants, frequent places visited, and interests. Every time someone adds a movie they like, or reacts to a post with one of the six options available, they are giving data brokers more information about themselves. Based on this information, data brokers can tailor ads to individuals in a much more accurate way - but the individual does not have access to the dossier about them. Steve Satterfield, a Facebook manager of privacy and public policy told ProPublica: Our approach to controls for third-party categories is somewhat different than our approach for Facebook-specific categories. This is because the data providers we work with generally make their categories available across many different ad platforms, not just on Facebook. Theoretically, contacting individual data brokers is the only way to prevent your information from being available to Facebook. There’s even a page in Facebook’s help centre listing a number of data brokers that sell personal data to the social media giant.  However, the reality is much more complex: many data brokers require a lengthy process to opt out – including providing identification. Even then, you’re not guaranteed to be removed, and with almost 100 identified brokers (though there may well be more), your efforts could be exhaustive and, ultimately unsuccessful.  The best way to prevent your information from being sold to Facebook, is to limit the information you share. Alternatively, do not use Facebook.",Facebook gathers information about its users from a variety of sources – openly available and collected by third parties
116,"Sen. Chris Murphy, presumably relieved, speaks to reporters after his almost 15-hour gun control filibuster. Pete Marovich/Getty Images A big part of what lends filibusters their singular urgency is that, according to Senate rules, the politicians who volunteer to do them are not allowed to go to the bathroom as long as they’re speaking. A senator’s willingness to endure this torturous indignity out of principle sends a strong signal about the depth of his dedication, and it inspires a visceral sense of sympathy and even awe on the part of those watching at home. Leon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer. When Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy announced his surprise filibuster in support of gun safety laws Wednesday, his commitment to resisting a bathroom break for hours on end was probably the first thing many observers thought of. It made a person wonder: How long would I go without peeing in order to force a vote on gun laws? As Murphy’s speech stretched to 6 hours, then 10, then 14, even New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had to remark on the inspiring fortitude of the man’s bladder And then, this morning, the New York Times dropped a bombshell : According to reporter David Herszenhorn, Murphy actually could go to the bathroom during his filibuster! Herszenhorn writes: Under Senate rules, once a senator is recognized on the floor and gains control of debate, she or he can hold it as long as humanly possible—a part of the Senate’s long tradition of unlimited debate. Refusing to relinquish the floor for any other Senate action, a filibuster typically requires standing there and speaking. But the rules also allow the senator to yield the floor, without giving up control, for questions or comments from colleagues, a strategy that Mr. Murphy used repeatedly on Wednesday and into Thursday morning. This allowed fellow Democrats, like his Connecticut counterpart, Senator Richard Blumenthal, to take over for substantial chunks of time, offering lengthy commentaries that made forceful and emotional points about gun violence in America but, more important for Mr. Murphy, allowed him to take bathroom breaks. Note the plural, please. Bathroom breaks! How often was this guy peeing, exactly? I reached out to David Herszenhorn for clarification as to whether or not Murphy was merely allowed to relieve himself during his filibuster, or whether he actually did. Herszenhorn replied, ""His staff says he did not but I can't say for sure. I'm writing around it."" The Times story was subsequently updated to say, ""Mr. Murphy could have taken a quick break, but he never left the floor and did not go to the bathroom throughout the 15 hours, according to a spokeswoman for the senator, Laura Maloney."" A different spokeswoman told me the same thing. However, that still leaves open the question of what Murphy was allowed to do. After all, if a senator declines the opportunity to go to the bathroom during a filibuster even though he can, does it still count as proof of his commitment to the cause, or does it become a senseless act of masochism? To find out, I called the Senate parliamentarian’s office, which advises the Senate on the rules governing what senators can and cannot do. I spoke to a source who declined to speak for attribution but provided an authoritative answer nonetheless. ""We advised Senator Murphy that he needed to stay standing and stay in the chamber,"" my source said. ""Rule 19 of the Standing Rules of the Senate says that if the senator desires to be speak and be recognized, he shall rise and address the presiding officer. So he needs to stay standing."" Ah, I thought to myself—but a man can pee standing up! Not so fast, wise guy. ""He needs to stay in the chamber,"" the source clarified. ""Otherwise how do we know if he’s standing?"" Yielding for questions, I was told, does not solve the problem: ""You still have to hold the floor. ... You can yield for questions, but you still have to hold the floor to entertain a question or answer the question, which means you have to stay standing and stay in the chamber.""","According to reporter David Herszenhorn, Murphy actually could go to the bathroom during his filibuster!"

128,"Susan Olsen was just 7 years old when she joined the cast of ""The Brady Bunch"" as the youngest one in curls. In a new episode of ""Oprah: Where Are They Now?"" on OWN, Olsen talks about sibling rivalry on the show, the alleged hookups between her and co-star Mike Lookinland (Bobby Brady), and how much money the cast really makes on all of those ""Brady Bunch"" re-runs. ""It was very much like we really were siblings, except we didn't have to live together and share one bathroom,"" Olsen says in the above clip. When it comes to competition between cast mates, Olsen says there was somewhat of a real-life ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia"" situation. ""I would say that the only thing that even comes close to genuine sibling rivalry would be between Eve Plumb, who played Jan, and Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia,"" she says. ""We love them both. We just don't see the two of them together."" Rumors have circulated for years about the cast mates' off-screen relationships, but Olsen can clear up her side. ""When it comes down to stories of all these alleged hookups, [Mike] Lookinland, who would be my partner, Bobby Brady, we used to kiss in the doghouse and we'd say we had 'makeout sessions' in the doghouse."" But it was all innocent fun, Olsen says. ""We didn't know how to make out! We would just kiss each other and go, 'I love you, I love you,' and hug."" Also in the video, Olsen explains why she left acting and the assumption that people always make about her income. ""People do tend to assume that we made a lot of money off 'The Brady Bunch' because it's on all the time,"" she says. ""So people just think that, oh, I must be rich. We all must be rich. And nothing could be further from the truth."" Olsen says it's not because she signed a bad contract, it was just the way syndication worked back then.

130,"According to the Daily Mail, scientists in Sweden are working on a ""cure"" for paedophilia. The trial involves a drug that disrupts testosterone. Forcing or persuading children to have sex is one of the worst things a person can do to them. Sexual abuse causes serious emotional and physical harm, and can ruin a child’s capacity to have healthy relationships as an adult. However, we mustn’t confuse all sexual abuse of children with paedophilia. Paedophiles are sexually attracted to children but they may, or may not, act on their urges. In fact, my experience indicates that most of the people who abuse children are not paedophiles. Research by Alanko and colleagues, looking at the question of whether paedophilia was inherited, showed that approximately 5% of men in the study with paedophilia had offended against children. In fact, people who offend against children, in my experience, are (mostly) men who are obsessed with sex and are looking for a sexual outlet, regardless of the age of the victim. In our research which looked at whether medication was helpful for sexual offenders who struggled with their obsession with sex, we found that while over 90% of them had committed offences against children, most of them had also abused adults. And, in some cases, victims included both males and females, showing a broad pattern of offending. These abusers will seek out any possible opportunity for sexual satisfaction and sadly children are often vulnerable and easy prey. Clinicians use the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria to diagnose paedophilia: Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The person is at least age 16 years and at least five years older than the child or children in Criterion A. Most paedophiles don’t act on their urges Many researchers think that paedophilia is a sexual orientation (like heterosexuality), rather than a psychosexual disorder or illness. Regardless of which it is, it’s very difficult for people to live with. Discovering at puberty that your sexual preference is for children, is usually a terrifying and depressing realisation. Think back to when you were 13 or 14 years old and just beginning to become strangely drawn to the boys or girls around you. Now think what it would have been like if those feelings were not for your own peer group, but for much younger children. You might wonder or worry a bit at first, and, as time went on, worry a lot. Why are you so different? What is wrong with you? Who can you talk to about it? It’s tough enough for teenagers to talk to their parents about sex, let alone tell them they are a paedophile. What we need to do, as a society, is to understand that some people are sexually attracted to children. More than this, we also need to understand that this attraction to children does not bring with it an uncontrollable urge to force sexual attention on children. Or course, there will be a small number of people who either can’t or won’t control their sexual urges, but for the most part, they can and they will. Think of yourself in a similar situation with your preferred partner type. How easy do you find it to control yourself in a roomful of the type of people you are attracted to? It’s not so difficult to do, is it? Medication to manage sexual arousal But what about paedophiles who do act on their urges (as well as sex offenders who prey on children) – do the drugs work for them? As the researcher leading the evaluation of the use of these types of drugs in the UK prison service, I can reassure you that they do reduce people’s obsession with sex. The drugs seem to work well and it is great that they are being offered (in this case) as a prevention tool. It’s also important that they are offered alongside psychological treatment to further help people control their urges. As of April 1, 2016, both medication and psychological treatment are also being offered in the UK across the whole of the prison service, and some charities, such as the Safer Living Foundation, are also looking to offer them as a prevention tool for people who have not yet committed an offence. Keeping children safe Although testosterone disrupting drugs can help sex offenders control their urges, they may not be a cure for paedophilia. As already described, most people who offend against children are not paedophiles. Most paedophiles are perfectly capable of controlling themselves and understand the damage that will be done to children by sexual abuse. We need to stop panicking about paedophiles, and focus our efforts on offering treatment and help to anyone struggling with their sexual urges. That’s what will help our children grow up safely.

136,"Karen Bleier / AFP / Getty Images ID: 9231242 Have you experienced crazy-long lines at Starbucks lately? If so, some of the company’s staff say there’s a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a money-making business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately — the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company’s hourly employees in the U.S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren’t getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain’s Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives; some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. ID: 9323172 If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com ID: 9323177 It’s an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for bare-minimum pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff — ""partners,"" in Starbucks lingo — about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. BuzzFeed News source ID: 9321991 Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a store-by-store basis. ""We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,"" said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks’ Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are ""historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor."" The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new ""forecasting tool"" that would ""adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business."" ""‘Reducing overspending’ seems like good business sense,"" Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company’s GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. ""Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,"" one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. ""The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I’ve ever experienced,"" said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U.S. sales growth from April to June — sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again. ""With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them,"" said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. I noticed a change in service myself back in June, as did other Starbucks customers. @Starbucks the customer service at my local shop is getting pretty disappointing. What's going on? :( — Jessica O (@StrawbryDevl) ID: 9291343 25min to get a latte at @Starbucks today was a new low in customer service. Time for a change? — Jack Cartwright (@jcxray48) ID: 9291319 Starbucks’ recent labor situation was the subject of an online worker petition started in June. Cutting back on hours ""creates an atmosphere where baristas are worn to the bone without being able to take a breath. Cleanliness suffers, speed of service suffers, partners suffer.....the labor climate keeps most baristas regularly underemployed, enough to qualify for benefits, but not enough to afford to pay for them,"" it read. The petition has attracted 13,500 signatures so far. Despite the attention garnered by the petition, Starbucks says it has been tracking complaints from its employees and only 3% have been related to staffing and scheduling in recent weeks. Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received ""overwhelmingly positive"" feedback about a U.S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October. On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, ""we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs,"" Riley said. A number of Starbucks workers — many who said they used to love their jobs — have shared their stories online about the effect of reductions in hours. Here are some condensed excerpts. ""Cutting labor is all-consuming."" ""Because our store manager is contacted constantly about hours, we are asked to send labor updates at 12p, 4p, and 8p every day. But even if we end up 100+ transactions over forecast and have already cut hours, we’re told we should have cut more. My store continually meets and exceeds the confusing, sometimes nearly impossible goals set forth by a computer system and people who are 1,000 miles away."" - Leslie ""Labor cuts are definitely taking a toll on us."" ""Although my schedules say 20 hours, since labor is being cut I can never hit the 20 hour mark. That means I don’t qualify for benefits. My husband’s 40 hours a week [at Starbucks] have turned into 29 hours a week. It’s hard. It’s hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting. Trying to calculate how much money we need to make just to get the kids fed, keep the lights on, and gas in the car. No one wants to give up hours, which means picking up shifts is getting harder and harder because everyone is scrounging for hours..I’ve never seen such an aggression about labor before. Over five years, and I’ve never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent..with the occasional ‘You wanna go home early today?’ But now it’s ‘You have to go home, we are way over on labor.’ ... In the past six months, I have heard more about numbers and labor than I have in the five years I’ve been with Starbucks."" - Caylee ""It didn’t feel like work at all at first. All of that changed a few months ago."" ""I noticed we seemed to be short staffed more often and it always felt like we were all flustered or moving at a dizzying pace. I also became a shift supervisor about a month ago. Advancing in my position is a huge change as it is. Add in even less people to work with but having the same volume of customers, and I am so physically and emotionally exhausted that my job is not even fun for me anymore. Want to know the last time I had a lunch break during one of my eight hour shifts? I couldn’t even tell you since it has been so long ago. In fact, today I worked a nine hour shift on the floor with just one five-minute break, long enough to take a few sips of my iced vanilla chai and eat a doughnut."" - Stephannie ""My hours have gone from 26 to 29 hours a week to 20 to18 hours a week."" ""With only two people on the floor at a cafe, we can barely keep up, as the lobby is neglected and bathrooms and customers are complaining. I plan to hang in there but a lot of partners have no choice but look for other employment."" - Vickie ""I recently had a baby, and was on an extended maternity leave due to complications. When I returned to work, hours were getting cut too much."" ""Short night shifts, cut down to two hours because of being sent home early, were too much. We were closing the highest volume store in the city with only three employees in the tourist area of town. It was a constant battle of being sent home early, or scrambling all night, unable to get everything done. Driving 30 minutes to work wasn’t worth it, especially for the poor pay as a barista with a newborn at home."" - Bailey ""I like working hard. I like being busy."" ""However, the reality is that if I spend my morning on the floor with six or seven people who are killing themselves to fill customer orders that really call for eight or nine baristas (mostly because [Global Labor Scheduling] doesn’t adequately account for things like multi-part orders or food [orders]), I’m exhausted by the time I get home. Beyond that, being overworked and understaffed hurts partner morale. It makes it so that stores not as clean and pleasant as they should be, and customers are not taken care of in the way that they deserve to be."" - Noel ""Every transaction is rushed through as the line continues to grow!"" ""Orders are put on the bar where our solo barista makes every single beverage as fast as possible while trying to focus on what they are doing whilst grabbing all those stickers from cafe, drive-thru, and [mobile order and pay]. The drive thru times are suffering horribly; our average ticket is six to eight drinks each car! It looks bad on the company from a guests perspective to have three or four partners on the floor when the place is absolute chaos."" - Samantha ""I came into this company in January and I loved my first few months."" ""But you can see it in our faces and demeanors how much it’s taking its toll. And now I received a paycheck for not even $200 that is nowhere near enough to pay my rent and bills. This so for two weeks work!!! Our store has failed two [Quality Assurance Standards Assessment] audits in the month because it never stays clean enough because we never have enough people to maintain the store. We never have schedules ready until a few days before the next week starts. Deliveries are made and stay there for days because on two man sets who’s going to put it away. We’re just exhausted, disappointed and now angry that all of our hard work is being taken for granted. I can’t survive on this dismal pay and only 15 to 20 weekly tips. I’m going to have to cut off my medical insurance and stop 401k just so I can make ends meet! I love my job but I can’t survive in this atmosphere!"" - Andre ID: 9323188 If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com","since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain’s Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive."
137,"Light-up shoes are a popular trend that has had a steady following for several years. Almost every child has owned a pair of these shoes and business isn’t slowing down. They’re an automatic hit with children who love to stomp around the house incessantly as they show off the stellar light performance in their shoes. Have you ever stopped to wonder what powers the light? Two parents were stunned by the destruction they suspect was caused by their son’s shoes. A couple in Katy, Texas noticed an odd haze building up in their vehicle. When Jovan and Attila Virag opened the back of their SUV, they smelled the familiar scent of burnt plastic and noticed that there was a hole burned into the floor and the back of their passenger seat was melted. They sifted through the contents in their backseat, but there was nothing that could have started a fire except for their 2-year-old son’s light-up shoes. When Attila took apart one of the charred shoes, she noticed that the lights were powered by lithium batteries. The father hadn’t the slightest idea that there were batteries in the shoes that could short and we suspect he isn’t alone. Understanding the mechanics of a pair of shoes isn’t high on most people’s priority list. The fire marshal was called in to investigate what may have caused sparks to ignite in the vehicle. A decision about the origin of the fire hasn’t been determined yet, but the shoes are being considered a possibility. The Virags are desperate to share this information with other parents. They were lucky that their son wasn’t wearing the shoes when the fire started. Otherwise, the consequences could have been way more severe. Although light-up shoes may be high up on your child’s wish list, it might be safer to err on the side of caution or at least do your research before purchasing the shoes.",The father hadn’t the slightest idea that there were batteries in the shoes that could short

When she first saw it, she thought it was a rat. However, when she took a closer look, she could spot a tiny, cold and wet kitten. Her heart melted immediately and she knew that she had to do something for the kitten. When Kathryn first saw this kitten, she was tiny and the umbilical cord was also attached to the kitten. She took the kitten home and named it Bruce, after the popular Bruce Wayne. Even after 12 days of taking care, the kitten barely managed to open its eyes and all it weighed was 100 grams. Eventually, Bruce came to life properly and opened its eyes wide. After a few days, Bruce was able to eat on his own. Kathryn ensured that Bruce was healthy at all times. And the care Kathryn took of Bruce was wonderful. After 9 weeks of caring, Bruce turned out to be strong and looked healthy. He also weighed nearly 2 pounds. Kathryn then created a Facebook Look at how cute Bruce is! This was all possible as Kathryn bothered to stop and look for the lovely little kitten.

151,"Here's a life tip for you - if a stranger ever comes up to you in the street, telling you he'll give you a dollar bill for free, and all you have to do is catch it between your fingers when he drops it, get the hell out of there, it's a trap! Seriously though, test it out with a friend, and unless you're an exceptional human being, you will never ever catch that dollar bill. But don't feel bad - there's a mathematical reason for why it can't be done, and it's rooted in the biological fact that the reaction time for most humans is about 0.2 seconds. Yep, 0.2 seconds approximately how long it takes for you to see something, process it, and physically react to it, which is actually pretty impressive when you think about it. But that's not nearly quick enough for your eyes to see that falling dollar bill, and have your brain to process that information, and instruct your fingers to snap together in time to catch it. So case closed, right? Well not quite, because you're perfectly capable of catching things on the fly - humans aren't completely useless - so why not some sweet, sweet cash? As the Numberphile video above explains, it all comes down to some good old high school maths. We all know that when we drop an item from a height, you can figure out the time it will take to get to the ground based on the falling velocity and the distance travelled. Or you can figured out the distance travelled based on the falling velocity and time it takes to get to the ground. You just need to use an equation like this, D = 1/2 gt2, where D = distance, t = time, g = gravititation acceleration, and gt = falling velocity. On Earth, gravitational acceleration is measured at 9.8 m/s2, but for the purposes of this calculation, Numberphile mathematician Tadashi Tokieda has rounded that value up to 10. If all that is giving you maths homework nightmares, don't worry, the video above does all the work. Just sit back, relax, and feel smart by osmosis. So when you use this equation to figure out a distance based on the human reaction time of 0.2 seconds and gravitational acceleration value of 10, you get 0.2 metres, or 20 cm. If you measure a dollar bill, you'll find that it's around 15 cm long, which means that if someone is holding it at 5 cm or less above your fingers, it's pretty much impossible for you to react fast enough to catch it. Curse you, slow mortal brain! But don't give up just yet, because there is hope if your one dream in life is to catch falling money between your fingers. You'll have to watch the Numberphile video above to find out why even someone without above average reaction times could improve their chances of achieving this feat, but let's just say if you do agree to that stranger's bet in the street, make sure he lets you choose which fingers to use.

The identical twin sisters, with their beautiful blonde hair and bright blue eyes, shared an unbreakable bond from the start. The girls were growing up normal and healthy. But 12 years later, on February 9, 2013, life changed in an instant. Peggy and Jeff found Hailey laying on the bathroom floor. She couldn’t open her eyes and was slurring her words. Worst of all, she felt excruciating pain in her head. Peggy and Jeff knew something was wrong, but at the time they had no idea the extent of Hailey’s condition. Doctors at the local hospital discovered Hailey had suffered a brain hemorrhage. When a preacher showed up to console the family, Peggy knew there was a chance she may not survive. Doctors said there was nothing they could do — but the Kehoe family refused to accept this. Life Lion, a critical care transport crew, flew Hailey to Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital. There, Peggy and Jeff gave doctors consent to perform emergency surgery in order to relieve the pressure in Hailey’s brain. At this point, she was in a coma and couldn’t breathe on her own. By Hailey’s side the entire time was Jenna, her identical twin sister. ""She held her hand and told her she needed to pull through this... because she couldn’t live without her twin,"" Peggy says. As it turned out, Hailey born with brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle in the brain of blood vessels connecting arteries and veins. Should Hailey wake up, Peggy and Jeff were told her AVM needed to be fixed or she would suffer her entire life. Within a few days, Hailey did wake up — and now everyone who knows her describes her as a true miracle.",Hailey had suffered a brain hemorrhage

Car washes are supposed to be fun to go through and save you the trouble of getting down and dirty to wash your car. However, around the one-minute mark, an idiot driver opens his door to grab a flyer from his windshield. The door gets crushed and water flows into the inside of the vehicle. Even though the video is from May 2010, it will NEVER get old. Why the driver would ever try and open his door completely blows our mind.

166,"Rio de Janeiro. The type of city that never fails to look good on television. The carnival city, sandwiched between sea and sheer cliffs, a city that lives for ball games, beach life and beautiful views. It should, then, be the perfect Olympic city too, a sporting mecca in a continent that has never hosted an Olympic Games. So why, with just 30 days to go, are people so concerned about what might happen? With people both inside Brazil and around the world in desperate need for something to cheer about, why are there so many worried frowns? And can anything be done to save the successor to London 2012? Are the Rio Olympic venues ready? Rio 2016 is split across four different zones across the city. The largest, the Olympic Park in Barra, just west of Rio, is, to put it graciously, a work in progress. When we visit, just a week before the BBC and the rest of the world's media are due to move in, the area is an open expanse of concrete, lorries and white tents surrounding venues that are supposedly complete, but in reality still have plenty of work to do. What's certainly lacking is some much-needed carnival colour. What the Olympic Park should look like... What it actually looks like... We visited the Aquatics Centre and the basketball venues, two stadia that have been completed. The swimming pool had water, but scaffolding still covered the upper tiers. Visible wiring round the spectator concourse of the basketball venue suggested at the very least a stripped back approach to venue construction. The delayed velodrome meanwhile was only signed off by the builders on Sunday 26 June. The first time spectators will actually enter the venue will be on the first day of competition. ""Of course there are still question marks and challenges as to how the venue will perform,"" said Rodrigo Garcia, sport director for Rio 2016 . However, he added that the 45 test events held across the Olympic venues, some with spectators and some without, give him confidence that the Park will deliver. ""We have really simple venues, we’re not planning fancy stadiums here in Rio,"" he said. ""We cannot go against the financial crisis that Brazil is living through today. There is no extra budget for us to expand on what should be in place for the Games."" For the first time this year, there is a new way to see what’s going on inside the Olympic Park. Google Street View have been mapping the whole area, including inside the venues themselves. It’s a neat concept, giving spectators who can't make it to Rio a Bolt's Eye View of the action. Except not all the venues are ready for Google’s 360-degree, 15-camera backpack to come and shoot. ""Some venues haven’t been photographed because they are not ready yet. We have everything set to do things before the Olympics."" said Google Brazil Partnerships spokesperson Carlos Aranha. We can't wait to poke around the rest. Why are they cutting it so fine? Quite simply, because Rio and Brazil are facing the worst economic recession in their history, worse even than the Wall Street Crash, say organisers. With fewer than 50 days to go until the Opening Ceremony, the city of Rio declared a ""state of public calamity"" , warning that without an injection of cash they would not be able to honour their commitment to the Games – or, for that matter, keep public health, security and education services running. If it sounds alarmist, that's because it is. The move immediately triggered additional investment from Brazil's federal government. Add to that a political crisis which saw the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in May , a collapse in oil prices and a rise in violence in the city, and you start to realise that putting on a Games is the least of Brazil's problems. That said, at no point during my trip did I, as a tourist, feel at risk, any more so than I would walking around London. Don't forget either, that with just two weeks to go until London 2012, the Army was called in after G4S confirmed they would not be able to provide enough private security guards. Rio isn't the first Olympic city to face doom-laden predictions, and it won't be the last. But Rio's problems far outweigh London's from four years ago. ""Many people ask us, ‘Wow, you’re in a lot of trouble’,"" said Rio 2016 communications director Adriana Garcia. ""Yes, we are, that’s true. We’re very transparent about it. ""Brazil is melting,"" she said. ""We have the worst political and economic crisis ever. We are facing a very challenging environment but we are confident that we will deliver a Games that will make people hopeful of a better situation."" The total cost of the Games currently stands at 39 billion Brazilian reais – roughly $4.6 billion. That is far less than the $15 billion price tag of London 2012 ""It may not be the luxury site that people want,"" said Garcia. ""But it’s what we have, it’s what we offer, it’s going to be the Frugal Games."" Will the Games make people happy? Philip Wilkinson is the international media manager for Rio 2016. Four years ago, he was on the communications team for Team GB, before he decided to follow the Games to South America. ""Brazilians are passionate about sport, and the city of Rio lends itself to it,"" he said. ""It’s surrounded by the ocean, the forest, the mountains, that lends itself to outdoor activities. It’s the perfect place to host the Games."" Ipanema Beach in Rio De Janiero, the perfect backdrop to the Games? He's right, Rio is seemingly full of athletes, from kids playing footvolley on the beach to hardened cyclists winding their way up to Christ the Redeemer. Security in the Barra Olympic Park But that doesn't mean everyone thinks the Games is money well spent. This is just the latest in a series of mega events that began with the Pan American Games in 2007, through to the World Cup in 2014. As always, debate is fierce surrounding the 'Olympic legacy'. In Rio, it's all about transport, an effort to solve the city's crippling traffic problems. ""There are projects that have been wanted for 30 or 40 years and have been gathering dust,"" said Wilkinson. ""Like the new Metro line connecting the west with the centre of the city. Like the four new bus rapid transit lines."" The metro is yet to be finished. Another legacy project, the cleaning of the polluted harbour where the sailing will take place, has already been canned. ""The bay won’t be cleaned as promised,"" said Garcia. ""When Brazil won the bid it promised that it would clean 80 per cent of the bay. Only 40 per cent will be cleaned."" But, she assured me, the sailors taking part in the Games will ""be able to compete in the best situation possible"". The Olympics brings other things, of course. Google has not just been photographing the inside of stadia. The company has been re-mapping the city for locals and tourists, as well as working with NGO Affroreggae to map some of Rio's bewildering favelas, highlighting local businesses and showing that there's another side to these poor neighbourhoods. In the end, it's not for outside broadcasters – who come in, marvel at the views, marvel at the sport – to decide whether the Olympics is money well spent. That's for Rio locals, the 'cariocas', to hold the organisers to account. ""The Olympic Games is designed to overcome whatever else is happening in the world,"" says BBC commentator and former athlete Brendan Foster, a veteran of 12 Olympic Games. ""Rio has followed the script. The stadiums won't be ready, there's disease, the public are turning their back, the country's facing economic disaster, all the sports face drugs issues, there's security, terrorism, all those things."" ""The Olympics has become a worldwide spectacle haunted by world-impacting problems,"" he added. ""Brazil is finding it tough, and is already finding it tough. But these Games will rise beyond all those issues. What happens is sport takes over. We go there not to measure the strength of the Brazilian government; we go there to share in the greatest athletes in the world doing their thing."" For Brazil's sake, let's hope he's right.",these Games will rise beyond all those issues
167,"As Google Allo becomes available worldwide, just over a week into its existence, its Google Assistant is already being called a standout in the rapidly growing field of bots. Pete Skomoroch, founder of early-stage startup Skipflag and formerly a principal data scientist at LinkedIn, called the search engine-powered Google Assistant ""the best I’ve ever used."" Other people in the bot ecosystem, like Matrix Partners investor and former Facebook Parse cofounder Ilya Sukhar, have had similarly rosy things to say about Allo. ""Allo’s assistant seems best in class. Everything else is meh,"" Sukhar tweeted shortly after the release of the chat app. This is the beginning, said Google vice president of engineering Scott Huffman, the ""first time you’re able to have conversation with Google."" This virtual assistant has the power to answer questions, perform translations, or plan a night out, and it is already embedded in Allo. But in the coming months it will also become part of Google Home and a true competitor to Amazon Alexa and other virtual assistants inside devices. Allo’s release comes at a time of rapid change and investment in chat apps. The race to the killer bot If you haven’t followed along, here’s where we are in the chat wars. In the span of less than six months, Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft — hands down some of the biggest tech companies in the world — either launched a bot platform for their chat app, gave developers access to their platform so they can make their own bots, or, in the case of Google, created a new chat app. Since April, tens of thousands of developers have created bots for Facebook Messenger, Kik, Slack, and the like. But none of these has been a breakout hit, the one that — like a rising tide — has the potential to lift the collective boats of virtual assistants and the bot ecosystem in general. In short, there’s been no killer bot — until Google Assistant. Microsoft’s Tay had potential to be a killer bot. But it turned out to be a racist, sexist jerk that smoked weed in front of the police. We checked: There are no plans for Tay to make a return at this time, a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison, exactly, Tay and Google Assistant. Tay was made to be more conversational than what we’ve seen from Google Assistant so far, but Tay was derived from Xiaoice, a bot made by Bing researchers that has the ability to do many of the things Google Assistant can do today. So it could be that Google — the last of the tech giants to show us its consumer-facing chat client for the coming chat wars — has built the first killer bot. What Google Assistant gets right Already downloaded 10 million times on Android, Allo and its Google Assistant are not without flaws, but here are a few things they do get right. First, Google Assistant leverages the powerful search capabilities that made Google a verb and a multi-billion dollar company. As my colleague Emil Protalinski described it, Google Assistant is ""like chatting with Google Search and Google Now in one."" Second, Allo appears to fundamentally understand the importance of group chat. Want to send a new message with Allo? Before you see Incognito Mode, Google Assistant, or your friends, you see ""Start a new group chat."" The ability to operate a bot within a group immediately gives Allo an advantage over platforms like Facebook Messenger, which does not allow bots to chat in groups. While in group chat, you can do Google searches together, look for a restaurant together, play group games, and, it appears, do anything else Google Assistant can do. This will be even more powerful when Google Assistant can make purchases, schedule appointments, or complete tasks for a group. Another standout feature: Smart Reply. Over time, Google Assistant promises to suggest responses based on the way you speak and your response to thumbs-up / thumbs-down surveys, given at the end of each query. More than generic common answers, Google Assistant learns your lingo and common responses. One more plus: Google Assistant may not be the only bot on Allo for long. The race to conversational commerce A day before the public launch of Allo, Google announced the acquisition of API.ai, a platform for building bots and virtual assistants through chat platforms and devices. This suggests that Google Assistant may operate alongside other bots made for the Allo platform. API.ai is currently used by more than 60,000 developers. ""API.ai offers one of the leading conversational user interface platforms, and they’ll help Google empower developers to continue building great natural language interfaces,"" Huffman wrote in a blog post. Google’s efforts underscore what exactly is up for grabs in this high-stakes game. Chat apps like Messenger and Line and WeChat and Kik have become some of the largest platforms in the world, larger than social media, and they’re now seen as a way to deliver goods and services. More than 20,000 bots have been made for Kik, tens of thousands have been made for Microsoft and Facebook, and developers appear to be very receptive to Apple’s recent launch of iOS 10 and an App Store for iMessage. Since the launch of iOS 10 a little over a week ago, more than 1,600 stickers or app extensions have been created for iMessage. These tech giants are beginning to build ecosystems around their platforms and their hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Even companies like Oracle and LinkedIn — companies not really associated with chat — launched bot initiatives in past weeks. This conversational commerce epiphany, and the stampede by U.S. tech giants to open platforms to third-party developers is happening in large part because of what WeChat has already accomplished in China. People use WeChat to shop, pay for services like utility bills, and speak to businesses (as well as friends). The ubiquitous app uses QR codes to bring commerce into the offline world. It’s the most popular messaging app in China, and last week WeChat parent company Tencent announced that the chat platform has started to test use of xiaochengxu, or Little Program. Little Program will allow WeChat users to download and use apps inside WeChat, similar to iMessage. Conversational commerce has been achieved in China because users can have new experiences, pay for things, and socialize with the world from inside WeChat itself. Much of what you need to do on a daily basis — split a bill, put money in a savings account, make purchases in the offline world — can be done without needing to jump into a webpage or another app. But that’s not how Allo works. Where Allo falls short Want the latest headlines in Allo? You’ll see the top three results. Tap ""More"" and you’re brought out of the app and onto the mobile web. Want to watch a YouTube video on Allo? You’re brought to the YouTube app. Want to watch a YouTube video when using iMessage? You watch the video inside iMessage. Upon its release, Google said Allo was made to solve the problem that happens every time you need to leave the app. This is the problem that arises when you’re chatting with a friend in order to figure out what you want to do tonight and need to search for a restaurant or check movie times. If the purpose of Allo is to solve this problem, it’s going to need to do more inside Allo. Building conversational commerce for a platform is largely about providing a holistic experience within a single chat app. Today Allo’s experience stitches together aspects of the Google suite of apps, web search, and the chat app. In the chat wars ahead, if other messaging app companies manage to get their own ecosystems operating primarily inside their apps — doing away with the need to leave to talk to a business, add a friend to the conversation, or buy groceries — they stand a good chance of converting users. It may only be the beginning for Allo and the chat wars, but whether Allo succeeds or not may depend on how much of the Allo experience is woven together from web searches and the suite of Google apps, and how much of it operates within Allo.",providing a holistic experience within a single chat app

She was stranded for almost 25 hours before she was rescued and evacuated to a Utah hospital. GoFundMe According to St. George News, the owners of the bed and breakfast Kornhorst was staying at were concerned when she didn't return the next day and called the police. She was in Arizona to participate in a volunteer hike for the Best Friends Animal Society of Utah. Ground search crews were sent out into the trails as well as the helicopter. Hildale-Colorado City Fire Chief Kevin Barlow said, ""It was really nothing short of miraculous that this lady was found. She was ledged out 200 feet down a cliff in a slot."" Authorities say when Kornhorst regained consciousness after the fall, she managed to find her wilderness emergency whistle and — though she couldn't physically move — blow it loud enough for a nearby search team to hear. When Kornhorst was properly hydrated, she was brought to the ICU in critical condition. Yesterday's update on a GoFundMe for Kornhorst explains: BEST NEWS: Amber had a huge day herself!

171,"One young Colorado couple’s prom photos taken with a tornado May 7 have captured international attention. The Facebook photo features a smiling Wray High School freshman Ali Marintzer and her boyfriend Charlie Bator posing together while a tornado visibly forms behind in the background. Mother Heidi Marintzer quickly took the photo after she felt confident the tornado was about three miles away -- far enough not to hurt her family, the Daily Mail reports. Ali also took a Snapchat selfie with the tornado later. ""Selfie ft. Tornado #prom2k16,"" Ali captioned the selfie. ""Our pic together was after it died down a little,"" Ali wrote on Facebook, referring to the photo her mother took. Despite the fact the twister eventually injured five people, Wray High School decided not to cancel their prom, although they delayed it by 45 minutes so everybody could safely arrive, the Daily Mail notes. Tornadoes are expected to continue to affect the area with a possible chance of hail on May 9. Yet unusual prom experiences are far more common than many might think, Jezebel reports. In one particularly rough incident, an unidentified girl discovered she was allergic to shellfish on her prom day. ""As I started to scratch my neck I felt a lump about the size of an egg at the base of my skull,"" the girl wrote to Jezebel. ""It was also at about this point that all of my friends noticed that I was the color of a tomato."" She was forced to go to the hospital shortly after. ""Suffice to say, I had a pretty hefty crowd (practically the entire Junior and Senior class) watch as I blew up like a red balloon and had to be carted out on a stretcher in front of everyone,"" she wrote. ""When I got to the hospital I got to have my beautiful, expensive dress cut off of me and I spent the rest of the night hooked up to IVs as my friends danced the night away."" In a more disturbing story, one former high school student recalled a prom tainted by recent allegations regarding the teacher in charge. The teacher, who had reportedly won the ""Favorite Teacher"" award several times, had allegedly been involved in sexual misconduct with a student. He resigned weeks before the prom and reportedly took all the funds designated for the prom. He later pleaded guilty to the sexual misconduct charge.

173,"I remember going to my first high school dance. To be honest, there wasn’t a whole lot of actual dancing going on, with the majority of my peers just standing around along the walls. As I’m sure many of you can relate to, we were mostly very shy... oh, and perhaps the utter lack of dancing skills might have had something to do with it. While there were certainly a few very talented dancers, everyone else could only slow dance on a very elementary level. And even then, you could still bet your bottom dollar that a lot of feet were being stepped on. But hey, what do you expect? Dancing takes a lot of training and finesse that comes with many years of training and maturity. So when an adult woman was asked to step onto the dance floor by a 14-year-old boy, what do you think happened?  A full-grown woman was enjoying herself at a concert when she was approached by a 14-year-old boy who asked her for a dance. As you might imagine, she was surprised but, perhaps out of courtesy, she accepted the invitation. And that’s when the young man grabbed her by the hand and proceeded to blow everyone’s mind. The 14-year-old boy immediately and very confidently takes the lead, spinning the woman several times. The look on her face is absolutely priceless! Not only is the young man’s footwork absolutely on point, the way he is able to guide her through the dance is absolutely impressive. The woman does a great job of keeping up but if you watch the video below very closely, it’s absolutely clear who is the pro!","The 14-year-old boy immediately and very confidently takes the lead, spinning the woman several times"

179,"How has an Aussie act entered 2015's EUROVISION competition? It's the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song contest and the organisers have added a surprising wildcard in the form of Australia - a country not traditionally in Europe. Or factually. Or even metaphorically. But the contest has had a cult following Down Under (think how much we liked Neighbours and Prisoner Cell Block H) for many years and has been given a one-off invitation this year. An Australian jury panel will submit the Australian vote and Australia may well be televoting along with other European countries. This seems plausible as Australia has run its own online vote (which has no bearing on the competition) since 2010. And one of the Aussies' more successful musical exports (apart from Nick Cave, Kylie and INXS) is of course Bjorn Again - the wildly successful parody act which pays tribute to Eurovision's most famous winner, Abba. Here's their version of Waterloo (which won Eurovision for the Swedes in 1974). Check out those bell-bottoms. Those judo outfits. That hair! When is it on? The 2015 Song Contest takes place this Saturday with Graham Norton supplying his usual commentary. It is set to air on BBC One and BBC Radio 2 at 8pm. If Australians want to watch the contest live, it will be aired by Australian broadcaster SBS at 5am Sunday morning Australian Eastern Standard Time, and repeated later at 7.30pm Sunday night. Where is it being held? After Austria's Conchita Wurst won last year, the 2015 Eurovison Song Contest will travel to her home country. The show will come live from the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna. So what's the deal? The bookies have made X Factor Australia judge Guy Sebastian one of the favourites to win in Vienna. The Malaysian-born singer-songwriter was the first winner of Australian Idol in 2003, and signalled his intent by penning a whole slew of potential songs in just three days. The one that made the cut is an jaunty R&B jam called Tonight Again which echoes Mark Ronson's recent global smash Uptown Funk. For those who may have woken up from a deep sleep, This is Uptown Funk: And the bookies odds are..? Sweden is the favourite to take this year's crown with Måns Zelmerlöw's track 'Heroes', being listed at 7/4 to win by William Hill. So what if Guy wins it for Australia? Now here's an interesting one. Traditionally the winning country is the host of next year's contest so if Australia takes the prize will the whole of Europe have to traipse over to Oz in a sea of sequins and glitter? No-one is sure. Organisers have said that Australia can't host the competition, but their broadcaster SBS could co-organise the event with another European country where the contest would take place. And will Australia be invited to defend their title? This hasn't been confirmed either but it's likely that they will be permitted an entry if the move is a hit with the viewers. It's an 'historic' step which will take the contest to a 'new global level' say the organisers. Michael Ebeid, managing director of broadcaster SBS, which airs the show in Australia, said: ""We are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for Australia to be represented on the world's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and are honoured that the European Broadcasting Union has supported us to achieve this ambition. ""SBS has been broadcasting Eurovision for over 30 years and we have seen how Australians' love of the song contest has grown during those years."" Executive supervisor of the contest Jon Ola Sand who works for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), said: ""It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying 'let's celebrate this party together'."" Alexander Wrabetz director general of host broadcasters ORF, said: ""The song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest TV entertainment event in the world. ""With the participation of Australia, together with our partners at the EBU and SBS, we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe, starting from the heart of Europe.""

183,"Stephen Colbert has tried extremely hard to remain as neutral as he can be during the presidential election season. After years of mocking the right on The Colbert Report, his late night show has attempted to remain above the fray. But lately, the sheer lunacy of the Donald Trump campaign and the growing concern that this narcissistic, dangerous buffoon might have a shot of actually winning has clearly weighed heavily on the host. Oftentimes before taping his show, Colbert will hang out with his audience and take questions. Sometimes they are personal ones, like this beautiful story about how he met his wife , but occasionally they are political. Tonight, the question of Donald Trump and his relationship with Vladimir Putin came up and Colbert clearly couldn’t help himself. An unidentified woman in the audience asks him what he would ask Donald Trump if the Republican nominee ever dared show up on his program, and Colbert ad libbed a one line takedown for the ages. Well, we’re not broadcasting right now so I guess I’d say ‘What does Vladimir Putin’s d*ck taste like?’ It brought the house down. It even managed to crack Colbert himself up. According to the Daily Beast’s Matt Wilstein, the joke killed so hard that the show’s writers and network execs are trying to figure out a way to throw it into the live show tonight. As ever with Trump’s searing comedy, there is an element of truth there. In the past week, the world has learned that Russia not only appears to have been responsible for hacking into the DNC’s private emails and releasing them to discredit Hillary Clinton, but that Donald Trump has uncomfortable ties to Putin. Things have only gotten worse for Trump after he gave a hastily arranged press conference with reporters that included to a message meant directly for Russia, encouraging the country to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them . He even promised they would be ""rewarded"" for the effort. Russia, if you are listening. I hope you are able to find the 30K emails that are missing. You will be rewarded mightily by the press. The comments have led to outrage on the left, silence on the right, and condemnation from many of America’s more preeminent leaders of the intelligence community.

188,"Australians know how to protest. Hundreds of people gathered Saturday local time at Parliament House in Canberra to make their way down a hill in a mass protest roll. The government plans to build a security fence to block access to the hill and other capital grounds. Protesters opposed to the fence rolled down the grassy slope just as many visitors to Parliament House often do. Even dogs got in on the democratic action. The event was organized by Lester Yao, an architect, on Facebook and delightful videos of the roll-a-thon were shared widely on social media. ""It was only going to be about 20 friends and families, and now we had more than 600 or 700 people,"" Yao told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""Unfortunately, kids might not be able to do this again and they're just enjoying themselves."" The fence became a matter of debate after demonstrators breached security at Parliament House earlier this year. Lawmakers had even tossed around the idea of digging a moat around the slope, but that was sanely rejected.",Protesters opposed to the fence rolled down the grassy slope
189,"is betteridge's law of headlines correct? Mats Linander 2015-03-19 - New York Betteridge’s law of headlines famously asserts that any headline that end in a question mark can be answered by the word ""no"". This ""law"" is of course no law – creating a counter-example is trivial – but should rather be seen as a tongue-in-cheek remark on how poor journalism sometimes hides behind dubious headlines. In this post we’ll try to answer to what extent Betteridge’s law applies to current articles on the internet. Using the scripts in this repository , we have crawled 13 separate news sites for a total of 26000 headlines (2000 per site) and tried to answer the 766 of them that end in question mark. Headline polarity A polar question is a question for which the expected answer is either ""yes"" or ""no"". We find plenty of these among our 766 headlines, but also plenty of non-polar questions. Roughly 46% of the 766 headlines ending in question mark are non-polar. They are not yes-no questions, so the answer can’t be ""no"". As such, they contradict Betteridge’s law. Yes and no but also maybe Even though Betteridge’s law clearly doesn’t hold for all headlines, could it be that the remaining 54% all have the answer ""no"", thereby making the law mostly correct? We did another sweep through the polar headlines to find out. There are also a number of headlines that we failed to answer. For instance, the BBC asks if India is the next university superpower but does not define what ""university superpower"" means. It doesn’t seem impossible that India could become that, whatever it is, but we can’t really say if it’s more likely to happen than not. Hence, the answer to this, and to several other questions, will have to be ""maybe"". Among the ""maybes"" there’s a whole plethora of reasons why a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" wasn’t provided. In some cases, like above, we doubt anyone can really say. In other cases the answer is probably out there somewhere, but we failed to find it. And there are of course also various sports related questions that we couldn’t muster up the energy to research properly. Interested readers can check out the raw data set for a closer look. With 46% non-polar and 20% answered ""yes"", at least two thirds of our headline sample violates Betteridge’s law. We conclude that it cannot be ""mostly correct"" either. Conclusion We’re going to go out on a limb here and guesstimate that the remaining ""maybe"" answers can, given enough time and effort, be turned into ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, and that these will be distributed similarly to the 20:17 ratio of the fully answered headlines. That would put the total ratio of ""no"" at 25%. In other words, it appears as if roughly a quarter of all headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word no. You can go ahead and call that Linander’s law of headlines, if you will.","In other words, it appears as if roughly a quarter of all headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word no."

Here's the number one mistake you might be making. What you're doing wrong: Placing your spoons and forks with the handles facing up, and wedged way up against each other. Why that approach sucks: In most dishwashers, the water shoots up from the middle. When your spoons are spooning face-down, the water and soap can't really reach all that crusty lasagna and filmy yogurt. How to do it right: Place utensils with handles facing down.

196,"Public toilets can be really dirty. I mean, who hasn’t opened a bathroom stall door and instantly realized how rank the smell is? Not to mention all the people who previously sat on that toilet seat to meet their needs... The solution seems obvious: cover the seat with a few pieces of toilet paper so you at least create a barrier between your body and all that nasty bacteria. Hopefully, this layer of paper will save you, right? Well, it’s probably time to reconsider. According infection specialists, covering the toilet seat with a layer of paper is not only useless—it may actually increase your risk of coming into contact with bacteria. The truth is you should never put toilet paper on a toilet seat. Although many people believe that public toilets are teeming with bacteria and intestinal diseases, modern toilets are designed to prevent just that. Gastrointestinal or sexually transmitted infections were once thought to spread through toilet seat-skin contact, but science has refuted this. In fact, the skin on our butts is an effective protection against bacteria, according to scientists. ""Toilet seats are not a vehicle for the transmission of any infectious agents—you won’t catch anything,"" William Schaffner, professor and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the Huffington Post. It’s also a good idea to rethink placing toilet paper on the toilet seat. Unlike toilet seats, paper is an ideal carrier for all kinds of bacteria. So you when you lay down some paper, pick it up again when you’re done, and then probably touch your face, you’re likely exposing yourself to more bacteria. The same applies to flushing the toilet. The handle is used by people who have just completed their ""business,"" making it a breeding ground for bacteria. Additionally, people forget to close the lid when they flush the toilet, which can spread bacteria around the bathroom. Studies have also shown that electric hand dryers spread bacteria much more than paper towels. Hand dryers spread germs up to six feet (1.8 m). So what can you do to minimize the risk of becoming ill for using a public bathroom? Wash your hands properly. According to researchers, this can reduce the risk of stomach diseases by about 50 percent.","Unlike toilet seats, paper is an ideal carrier for all kinds of bacteria.

Then, he noticed the writing underneath and realized that his third grader had been stamped with the words, ""I Need Lunch Money."" Shocked at first, he didn’t register the implications of the stamp. As it turns out, the elementary school that Bivens’ son attends, Gardendale Elementary in Gardendale, AL, operates its cafeteria with refillable charge cards. Students who buy lunch at school swipe the card to pay for lunch. Parents keep the cards refilled by topping them up with money from time to time and are notified if the balance runs low. Bivens understood the card system, but was shocked by the method of delivery. His little boy brings a packed lunch to school almost every day and rarely needs lunch money, unless he wants to buy a special treat from the cafeteria. As a result, he almost never has to use his school lunch card and his parents decided not to top it up so close to the end of the school year. Still, Jon Bivens told The Huntsville Times that he was stunned by the way that the school had chosen to convey the message to him as a parent. He says that, in the past, the school had called or sent emails or letters to remind parents of the balance. The stamp, which he calls a ""brand,"" was typically a communication of last resort for the school. Bivens says he received no direct contact, and adds, ""When you start stamping a message on a child’s body instead of calling...it’s not okay."" He also calls the stamping, ""a form of bullying.""

And that fact is that badminton is the best sport at the Olympic games. My colleagues Luke Kerr-Dineen and Nate Scott have tried to brainwash you into thinking that equestrian and rugby sevens are the best, but they are very wrong and I am very right. Trust me, because I know about badminton. When I wasn’t watching the U.S. women’s soccer team lose to the Ikea-demons (aka Sweden) I have spent today transfixed by the badminton livestream. The speed with which these players move is truly staggering, and the fast-pace kept my attention which, in the age of multiple screens at multiple times, is no easy feat. I can’t even make it through a full episode of Friends anymore without checking my phone. I am a true millennial disgrace. But I digress. What matters more than my embarrassing attention span is that have extensive experience playing badminton in my grandmother’s backyard with my cousins using the broken rackets that spent most of the year acting as homes for families of spiders in my grandparents’ garage. So between the amount I’ve watched today and the amount I played as a child, I am basically a badminton expert. Which puts me in the unique position of being able to tell you all exactly why badminton is the G.O.A.T., the Simone Biles, the Michael Phelps of Olympic sports. Which is that, as you watch it, you might think to yourself, ""Hey, maybe I could actually do that."" This never happens when you watch the Olympics during primetime. If you, as someone who is not on an elite swim team, are delusional enough to think you could hop in a pool and give Katie Ledecky a swim for her money, then you’re out of your gourd. If you aren’t a gymnast, thinking you could even walk on a balance beam, let alone flip over on one, would be like a blogger saying to a pilot, ""No, no, trust me, I can fly this thing."" Badminton, however, is a sport where you can trick yourself into thinking that maybe, if you really put your mind to it, you could be a contender. You can’t, of course. These athletes have trained for years, have dedicated their lives to this, have fast-twitch muscles that are faster than those of a cat chasing a laser beam that you’ve aimed at the floor to drive it crazy.

204,"In November, Marvel Studios’ fourteenth theatrical release Doctor Strange will open the doors to the quantum realm and expose audiences to a brand new side of the cinematic universe. Fans of the MCU have already been introduced to the power of technology in Iron Man, the limits of the human body in Captain America: The First Avenger, otherworldly magic with Thor, and Ant-Man showed everyone how small the world can really get. In the past decade, Marvel has become the standard-bearer for contemporary blockbuster filmmaking. There are a lot of reasons for the studio’s success ranging, from exemplary casting, solid narrative structure, and wealth of source material to draw creative inspiration from. However, despite all their success, there is plenty of room for their storytelling to grow. One of the most prevalent criticisms of Marvel Studios’ theatrical releases is that the films lack memorable villains that will stand the test of time, with critics pointing out that their roster of baddies all seem to mimic the given protagonist’s own skill set. While Marvel’s methodology may be transparent, their approach to introducing villains is by design. During our visit to the set of Doctor Strange, Marvel President Kevin Feige stated the benefits of telling superhero origin stories with villains who mirror the lead: ""Clearly we will get to that [non-doppelganger match ups]... You want to have characters that inhabit the same world when introducing a new world, a new mythology for lack of a better term. You want to explore that as much as you can."" Marvel’s approach of starting out with villains that resemble the hero isn’t unique to the MCU – in fact, it’s a core part of the modern superhero origin movie. In Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, the main character had to face off against a dark reflection of himself in Ra’s Al Ghul, and that kind of reflection can be a valuable part of the hero’s journey narrative: highlighting the protagonist’s heroism by showing how they could just as easily used their powers to become a villain. Similarly, in Warner Bros.’ first DC Extended Universe movie, Man of Steel, the antagonist was General Zod – a Kryptonian with identical abilities to Superman, who uses those abilities for the purposes of destruction. In building the MCU, Marvel made the practice of using villains as dark reflections of heroism a core part of each origin story. The Iron Monger (Jeff Bridges) may be the most forgettable Marvel villain yet, but his presence put a spotlight on Tony Stark’s – and Robert Downey Jr.’s – unique brand of ingenuity and charm, which resulted in an iconic hero for the ages. Doctor Strange will introduce sorcery and mysticism into the MCU, staying relatively faithful to its comic book origins while also introducing the film’s primary antagonist, Kaecilius , played by Mads Mikkelsen (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story): a former Master of the Mystic Arts who was trained in the ways of sorcery long before the events of the movie. The choice of Kaecilius as the movie’s antagonist and his similarities to Strange are far from arbitrary, and Feige explains why yet another evil reflection of a Marvel hero was needed in the upcoming Doctor Strange film: ""Kaecilius doesn’t know Strange from a hole in the wall. He predates him. But when you’re teaching an audience about sorcerers and that reality and you’re going to talk about the past anyway and you’re going to get into their history anyway, much better to tie-in your bad guy with that instead of laying all this groundwork of parallel dimensions and sorcery and say, by the way, a meteor hit on the other side of the world, it went under the water, and this evil thing developed. What does that have to do with magic? Nothing... That’s not the way we’ve developed them up to this point. "" Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have explained that Captain America: Civil War was only the beginning of a prolonged battle that will extend into Avengers: Infinity War , in which our heroes will face off against the strange and powerful villain Thanos. Barring the surprise addition of a purple alien Avenger with a big chin who doesn’t like standing up , Thanos doesn’t appear to be a direct doppelganger of any major MCU superheroes, and Feige explains that the diversification of hero/villain dynamics will continue as the cinematic universe moves away from origin stories: ""Needless to say as more characters encounter each other in other films they’re certainly going to be up against things that they don’t know anything about and have no comparable to."" There is great narrative power in having a visual representation of a protagonist’s potential dark side. The doppelganger is often an exploration of what the hero would be like without an agreeable moral code. Once that line is established, exceeding the lead character’s known limitations is what creates unforgettable heroes. However, Marvel’s characters are maturing and the studio finds themselves at a narrative and thematic crossroads for all of the core Avengers. In the third phase of Marvel’s films, the superhero’s world has become infinitely more complicated. There is a gradual overhaul of Marvel’s overall structure, that began in Civil War and will continue beyond Avengers: Infinity War. While the doppelganger trope will probably never go extinct, due to its roots in comic books. It looks like fans are poised to finally find out exactly what happens when the separate worlds of the Marvel cinematic universe collide. And for the first time, it does not feel familiar at all.

209,"""The Bachelor"" wrapped up its 20th season with Ben Higgins proposing to Lauren Bushnell on Monday night’s finale, and now that the newest reality TV power couple is allowed to speak freely, the engaged couple had one of their first public experiences: a press call with reporters. Higgins and Bushnell spoke to Variety and other outlets early Tuesday, the morning after their big episode aired. ""My feelings for Lauren were very strong right away. I was still going to be open to the process. Lauren definitely caught my eye from night one,"" Higgins said at the top of the call, talking about the dramatic storyline that saw him telling the two finalists, Bushnell and new ""Bachelorette"" JoJo Fletcher, he loved them both — something that had never been done on the show. Very cheerful on the call, the pair answered reporters questions about last night’s fake-out wedding on ""After the Final Rose,"" the possibility of having an actual TV wedding, their thoughts on ""The Bachelorette’s"" diversity saga, plus, will Higgins compete on ""Dancing With the Stars?"" ""Dancing With the Stars"": Higgins says he will not compete on ABC’s reality dance competition because he wants to focus on his engagement — but he did allude to an offer. ""My focus is not on what’s next. It’s on Lauren and I. Any decision that was made post show was based on what was best for us, and I believe that what’s best for us is to really concentrate on what’s best for us and to really spend as much time together as possible,"" Higgins said. Asked by Variety if he received an actual offer, ""The Bachelor"" tried to explain, saying, ""Right now, a lot of those requests come down through the ABC pipeline so, I don’t want to call it offers, but just people asking if I’m interested comes down from a group that is separate that me. Was I asked? I’m sure it was talked about."" However, the couple will be watching ""DWTS."" They agreed, ""It’s a great cast!"" Thoughts on the new ""Bachelorette,"" Higgins’ runner-up, JoJo: ""I hadn’t talked to JoJo until last night,"" Higgins said, confirming that he hadn’t spoken to his runner-up, after he proposed to Bushnell. ""It was really nice to see her. She’s very supportive and she’s obviously in a headspace where she’s able to move on and I’m able to move on. It sounds like she’s doing really well and we’ll all see how well she’s doing here in May."" Bushnell said that she and Fletcher have spoken a few times on the phone since production wrapped. ""She was always really supportive ... We just wanted to let each other know that we both have a great level of respect for each other and that didn’t change no matter what the outcome was."" Reaction to ""The Bachelorette"" diversity debate: Fletcher is half-Persian, but still, many critics and fans have been quick to slam the ABC franchise, which lacks in diversity. When asked by reporters what they thought about that, the couple stayed mum. ""First off, JoJo as the bat, I think she deserves it,"" Higgins said. ""How they decide on ‘The Bachelorette’ is not up to me. I didn’t even know I was in consideration to be the next ‘Bachelor’ until they called me."" When Bushnell was asked if she had anything additional to add, she avoided the question. ""No, I think Ben pretty much summed it up,"" she responded. ""Neither him or myself have anything to do with the decision-making."" Later in the call, another reporter re-asked the question, which was deflected again. Will they have a TV wedding? ""We haven’t ruled anything out and all of the support from everyone has been so amazing that it would be something that we would consider,"" Bushnell said. ""It’s not ruled out, but we also don’t know what opportunities are going to present themselves, but all we know is that we want to get married."" Why didn’t they just get married on TV last night when Chris Harrison presented the opportunity? (Higgins’ pastor was there after all...) ""For me, as much as I want to marry Ben tomorrow, I would also like a big celebration that’s planned with my family and my friends, so for me, I don’t think I thought too much into it, but it was tempting,"" Bushnell said, to which Higgins replied, ""It just wasn’t really an option, but it was a good try."" Will they be live-tweeting JoJo’s season of ""The Bachelorette,"" like other alums of the franchise have done? ""I’ll be a fan of the show,"" Higgins said. ""Let’s talk about that in May and see how we’re doing with that because it does take an emotional toll,"" he said, explaining that watching Fletcher’s journey will be difficult to watch, but also exciting. ""I think we’ll see."" The new season of ""The Bachelorette"" has headed into production, and premieres on May 23.",Higgins says he will not compete on ABC’s reality dance competition because he wants to focus on his engagement — but he did allude to an offer.

Maybe she pushed a classmate in line, or perhaps he called out an answer without raising his hand. Or maybe she wrote her name in cursive.

In red pen at the top of the lesson sheet, her teacher wrote: Stop writing your name in cursive. You have had several warnings.

212,"Lucas Film For all the lightsabers, X-Wings and Wookies, Star Wars has always been, at its heart, the ongoing story of the galaxy’s most dysfunctional family. Now, if one recently revealed fan theory turns out to be true, you can expect the familial drama to get even messier in Episode VIII. According to Reddit user Beeslo, there’s a chance that scavenger turned (possible) Jedi, Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings. While finding false connections between characters is pretty common place in Star Wars fandom (remember when we were all convinced Emperor Snoke was actually Jar Jar Binks?), Beeslo actually has some not-totally-crazy evidence to back up their claim. In the Star Wars universe comic Shattered Empire — a story that bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens — we’re introduced to Force Trees. These are trees that, as you can probably guess, are imbued with the living force. At the end of the four-part series, Luke Skywalker bestows a Force Tree on to a trusted friend, a pilot named Shara Bey. Shara plants the tree outside of her house, which she shares with her young son, Poe Dameron. That certainly helps explain what makes Poe such an insanely talented pilot — he was absorbing the Force every time he went to play in his family’s backyard! Lucas Film From here Beeslo begins to theorize that maybe Poe wasn’t an only child, maybe his parents gave him a little sister. And if just hanging out around a Force Tree can give you Force powers, imagine how powerful a kid conceived near one would be. Honestly, this makes us feel a little bad for Poe. It’s never easy when your younger sibling turns out to be better than you at everything. Imagine how he’ll feel when he discovers his little sister, Rey, is an advanced level Force user while he’s never even wielded a lightsaber before. Obviously the theory isn’t one hundred percent sound. For one thing, Rey and Poe don’t share any screen time in The Force Awakens. It’s hard to imagine that the filmmakers wouldn’t even hint at such a gigantic relationship. Then again, there were no real hints in A New Hope that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader shared any kind of lineage. Maybe we’re just being kept in the dark for an Empire-sized reveal. No matter what, if this all turns out to be true, it’s bound to make the relationships in Episode VIII just as complicated as we’ve come to expect from the Star Wars saga.","Rey, and the best pilot in the resistance, Poe Dameron, could be siblings"
213,"Shortly before the debut of the biggest element of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, nearly two-thirds of Americans -- and almost three-quarters of the uninsured -- still don't know what's coming, according to a poll released Saturday. Obamacare's health insurance exchanges, the online marketplaces in every state for the uninsured and people who don't get health benefits at work, are scheduled to open for business on Tuesday. The Obama administration, many states and partners in the private sector have been promoting the exchanges for months to little measurable effect, the survey conducted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows. The health care reform law is projected to reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 14 million next year, and millions more over the coming decade. But those numbers won't budge unless millions of consumers use the exchanges to shop for coverage and to learn whether they qualify for financial assistance or Medicaid benefits. These latest poll findings, which are consistent with surveys taken since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, show how much work is left to be done by the White House and others who want the largest expansion of health care in decades to succeed. The Kaiser Family Foundation polled Americans from Sept. 12 to Sept. 18. Just 15 percent of those polled, and only 12 percent of the working-age uninsured, knew the exchanges were launching in October for the start of a six-month sign-up period. Sixty-five percent of respondents were aware that Obamacare created the exchanges, however. The survey found that more than three years after the law's enactment, 51 percent of Americans felt as though they didn't understand it well enough to determine how it will affect them and their families. More than two-thirds of the uninsured -- those who stand to gain the most -- said the same. More than half of respondents said the news media focuses mainly on the politics of health care reform, rather than on how it affects people. A majority also said there was no news source they could trust to provide information about the law. Asked what questions they would most like answered, Americans most commonly wanted to know how much health insurance would cost under Obamacare, how the spending is financed, and where they can find a simple summary of the law. The survey demonstrates just how poorly informed, and often misinformed, Americans are about what's in the Affordable Care Act. The best-known aspect of the law is the controversial individual mandate that nearly every legal U.S. resident obtain health coverage or face a tax penalty: 79 percent said they were aware of the provision. Majorities also knew about other key features such as the ability of states to expand Medicaid to more poor people and the ban on health insurance companies' rejecting people with pre-existing conditions. But significant numbers of Americans also continue to believe various fictions about Obamacare. More than 40 percent of those surveyed said, incorrectly, that so-called death panels will decide how to treat Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives, that Medicare benefits have been reduced and that undocumented immigrants will receive money to pay for health insurance. None of those things is true. More than half of those surveyed said the law includes a ""public option,"" a government-run insurance plan that was proposed but rejected by Congress and is not part of the law. Overall, a larger percentage of Americans view the health care reform law unfavorably than favorably: 43 percent vs. 39 percent. The survey results also showed a sharp and persistent partisan divide. More than two-thirds of Democrats have a favorable opinion of Obamacare, compared to 11 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of independents. Ongoing Republican efforts to thwart the law, including the current attempts to defund it, are opposed by a majority -- but are popular among Republicans, especially those who identify with the tea party movement.",the exchanges were launching in October for the start of a six-month sign-up period

222,"""Murphy Brown"" just turned the ripe old age of 25. The long-running comedy starring Candice Bergen premiered 25 years ago today on November 14, 1988. Now, 25 years later, ""Murphy Brown"" is returning to TV in a new syndication deal on Encore Classic. The new channel replaces Encore Love as part of a new strategy to focus on viewer subsets that use the pay channel. Encore Classic is aimed at the Baby Boomer demographic with reruns of ""Murphy Brown,"" ""Night Court"" and ""Magnum, P.I."" along with films such as ""Tootsie,"" Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" Bergen told Zap2It she's excited the show is coming back to TV airwaves. ""I have no idea why it's taken so long. I was always told it was because the music rights were so expensive, because every episode opened with a Motown song. I'm thrilled it's going back on -- and without commercials, which is lovely. I barely watched the show in its last five years, so I haven't seen it in a long time."" ""Murphy Brown"" starred Bergen, Faith Ford, Grant Shaud, Joe Regalbuto, Charles Kimbrough and Lily Tomlin. The show ran on CBS from 1988-1998. There was talk of reviving ""Murphy Brown"" for new episodes if Sarah Palin ran for president, but Palin never ran and ""Brown"" remained dead. Bergen, who reunited with her cast at the TV Land Awards in 2012, said ""Murphy Brown"" may have lasted a little too long. ""Five years is a long time, but 10 ... the show shouldn't have gone that long, That was probably not smart, but it's very hard to pull the plug on something you've been with from the beginning,"" Bergen told Zap2It. ""You get to know people well. Even though it's great fun to do a half-hour comedy, it's very intense.""

224,"Many years ago, I found myself standing in my boyfriend’s home, listening patiently as he argued with his ex on the phone. It was one of those petty discussions about absolutely nothing, a mere excuse for connection between two individuals struggling to let go of each other. At the time, I was the New Girlfriend, and his ex had recently learned about me. Needless to say, she wasn’t happy about the news of him moving on. She was screaming loud enough that I could hear her across the room. ""Does that woman have any idea what a horrible person you are?"" she asked. At that point, he opted to involve me in the conversation. ""Tara?"" He he turned to me. ""Do you know how horrible I am?"" I smiled and gave him a sarcastic, ""yeah."" At that point, his ex decided to speak to me. Once we were connected, her angry tone dissipated as she embraced a more big-sister kind of role. ""When I met him, I never thought he would ever hurt me,"" she confessed. At the time, I thought she was crazy and tried to contain my laughter. ""Well then,"" I told her. ""I guess you must’ve done something to deserve it."" To this day, I have no idea what her intentions were. Did she honestly want to warn me about the dangers of getting involved with the man who had caused her so much pain? Or was she just trying to scare me away in hopes that they might reconcile? It doesn’t matter. The point of my story is this: Don’t bother trying to warn a new woman about your ex. You might have the best of intentions. Perhaps you really do want to save her the trouble and heartache that you’ve come to know so well. However, chances are your advice will fall on deaf ears. Here’s why: She doesn’t want to hear it. Their relationship is new and exciting. When they’re together, she feels exhilarated and happier than she’s ever been in her life. Your ex is currently fulfilling the role of Man Of Her Dreams, and she can’t imagine him as anything else. Your well-intentioned warning of his dark side would come as an unwelcome buzz kill. If she were to hear you at all, she’d likely reject your advice because it conflicts with everything her heart tells her. She won’t give you any credit. In their love story, she’s Cinderella and he’s Prince Charming. Who are you? You’re the bitter ex and unfortunately, your experience doesn’t count for much in her mind. He probably told her that you were a terrible partner and he suffered miserably for most of the time you were together. It’s realistic to assume that she thinks you’re jealous of her age, beauty and happiness. Why on Earth should she listen to you? She needs to make (and learn from) her own mistakes. Remember when you thought your parents were old fuddy-duddies who knew nothing? They probably warned you about a lot of things, yet you had to find out for yourself. Didn’t you? She does too. You might be wrong. What if the New Woman is truly better suited to build a life with your ex? The possibility exists that she’s a more compatible partner than you were. As time goes by, she might bring out the best in him, and that will likely make things better for you. The cold hard truth is this: Once you and your ex have separated, his relationships are none of your business. As a mother, you have every right to be concerned about your children’s comfort and safety with the new woman. But as an (angry, wounded, bitter, smarter) ex, you have no right to counsel another adult about her choice in romantic partners. The good news is, while you’re not busy worrying about your ex’s new flame, you have more time to think about yourself. Keep learning from your own experiences, and you can look forward to greater happiness in your own life.",Don’t bother trying to warn a new woman about your ex
225,"Summit Entertainment When it comes to introverts and extroverts, many see these two personality groups as being polar opposites. Introverts are those who need to recharge after spending time with others and that’s something extroverts just don’t understand, right? Well, according to a new study , that may not be the case. According to The Atlantic , researchers had 48 Finnish university students report their behavior and feelings five times a day. They did this for 12 days via a phone survey and at the end, the participants took a test measuring where they fit on the scale of the Big Five personality traits: neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion. What they found has given new meaning to the introvert/extrovert divide. Universal Pictures / giphy.com The results: Whether they were introverts or extroverts, participants consistently felt the need to recharge after socializing. In other words, when someone took part in extroverted behavior, they ended up feeling happier in the moment, but were ultimately tired three hours later. The same thing happened when the students did things like study or work. Yes, extroverts may be more eager to socialize than introverts, but that doesn’t change the fact that being around others makes them tired. The study explains ""For those who do feel depleted after social interaction ... it may be pleasant to learn that such a reaction is quite normal (and does not imply that one is an introvert or that one is lazy)."" Finishing the Hat / giphy.com Though this is one study, others do point out that extroverted behavior can make many different types of people happy. Plus, whether someone is an introvert or extrovert, they can exhibit different behavior depending on the day, mood, or situation. Ultimately, while it is fun to learn more about our personalities, it’s also important to remember that nothing is set in stone. Each one of us is constantly evolving and, because of this, we shouldn’t feel as though we’re boxed in by labels such as introvert or extrovert.",the need to recharge after socializing

232,"Human personality is fantastically complex, which is why personality tests that try to shoehorn a person into binary, defined categories — e.g. thinking or feeling, but not both — are often considered problematic. But there are indeed differences between people that can be tested. One of the most common, preferred ways psychologists use to measure personality is what's called the ""Big Five"": extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Want to skip to the quiz? Here's the link. People fit into a spectrum on these five dimensions. Everyone is more or less extroverted or more or less open to experience. (For a more thorough breakdown of what the big five personality dimensions mean, you can check out this page by the director of the Personality and Social Dynamics Lab at the University of Oregon.) There are complex elements of personality that fit within these categories. Captured within ""conscientiousness,"" for example, are traits like ""dutifulness,"" a person's sense of obligation, and characteristics like ""self-discipline,"" referring to willpower or the ability to persist on a task. While these are related and both fall under the umbrella of conscientiousness, a person might have a very strong sense of obligation but a less developed sense of self-discipline. The most thorough personality tests make distinctions between these characteristics. There are multiple versions of these tests, but one thorough and well-regarded one is called the International Personality Item Pool. A full version of this test contains hundreds of questions and can take 30-40 minutes to complete. But retired Penn State psychology professor John Johnson has a page that offers not just the full test, but also a new, shorter version that takes only 10-20 minutes to finish. More than 20,000 people have taken the short version of the test, giving it enough of a sample size to give scientifically valid results (more than half a million have taken the full version). The questions are pretty simple. There's a five-point scale that goes from ""very inaccurate"" to ""very accurate"" and you note how true statements like ""Worry about things"" or ""Love large parties"" are for you. When you're done, you get a complex report about your personality, with a score not only for each of the five dimensions, but also a subscore for six subcategories and an explanation for what they mean. As an example, I scored highly in ""Openness to Experience,"" particularly in the ""Adventurousness"" subcategory. As an explanation, they told me: High scorers on adventurousness are eager to try new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different things. They find familiarity and routine boring, and will take a new route home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel uncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines. Your level of adventurousness is high. As someone who lived abroad for several years, traveling for at least one without a clear destination or end point, this rings true.

233,"A US scientist has accidentally proved a 200-year-old theory about jumping electric eels by famous 19th century explorer Alexander von Humboldt. The celebrated naturalist recounted witnessing a riverside battle between a group of horses and electric eels while on a trip in the Amazon in 1800. There have been no recorded sightings of electric eels attacking anything on the shore since, so it had been assumed that von Humboldt had exaggerated which he had seen. But biologist Professor Kenneth Catania, from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, found that the eels will jump out of the water to attack larger predators which when they become partially submerged in the water. While using a net with a metal rim handle to move them, he noticed that after a while the eels stopped trying to dodge the net and began to rise out of the water to press their chins to the handle and ""generated a series of high-voltage pulses"". After noticing the phenomenon, he designed an experiment when he placed them in a tank with prosthetic human arms and alligator heads - covered with a conductive metal strip and LED lights to show the electricity generated - partially submerged in the water. He filmed them jumping up and using their chins on the side of the head and the arm to amplify the electric shock. Prof Catania said the jolt of electricity created by eels is much weaker in the water, but if they extend themselves out of the water they distribute the shock directly at the animal that they perceive is threatening them. He explained: ""This allows the eels to deliver shocks with a maximum amount of power to partially submerged land animals that invade their territory. ""It also allows them to electrify a much larger portion of the invader’s body"". The scientist said he had dismissed von Humboldt’s findings initially saying: ""The first time I read von Humboldt's tale, I thought it was completely bizarre.Why would the eels attack the horses instead of swimming away?"" In the study, published online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prof Catania explained that the leaping behaviour is likely to have evolved in several stages. Getting closer to the target would have increased the effectiveness of the shocks. Later generations of eels would have improved the accuracy of their leaping to the extent they were able to make direct contact with their victims. He concluded: ""Each stage provides a successive advantage, suggesting how it may have evolved"". Prof Catania thinks it is ""reasonable to suggest that von Humboldt observed a similar eel behavior on March 19th of 1800"".",eels will jump out of the water to attack larger predators
235,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is in excellent health and will stay that way for the rest of his time in office, the White House said Thursday. The pronouncement came in a two-page memo from Obama's doctor following the president's physical exam last month. It's the first report on Obama's health that the White House has released in nearly three years. The information was made public after repeated inquiries by The Associated Press into the lack of transparency about the president's physical well-being. The White House's previous update on Obama's health came in October 2011. Obama continues to make healthy lifestyle choices, according to the report, by eating a healthy diet, exercising daily and remaining tobacco-free. Obama is a former smoker who is often seen chewing nicotine gum. He suffers from mild tenderness in the muscle beneath his right foot, which he treats by taking an occasional ibuprofen tablet. ""The president's overall health is excellent,"" Obama's doctor, Ronny L. Jackson, said in the memo to press secretary Jay Carney.

247,"We can never be sure what Bruce Blunt, a 40-year-old marijuana aficionado in Chicago, was thinking when he blew a puff of weed smoke into his pet chameleon's mouth. What we do know is that he wasn't charged for animal cruelty. Blunt (yes, that's his real name) became a viral sensation when the video of him blowing marijuana smoke into his pet chameleon's mouth racked up over 500,000 views in a matter of days. Blunt claims the smoke helps calm his chameleon, whose name is Binna and who can sometimes be aggressive. After catching wind of the video, PETA filed a complaint with Chicago authorities, who arrested Blunt several days later. However, Judge Robert Kuzas ruled that Blunt's behavior, while ""really, really uncalled for and immature,"" was not criminal, as the animal showed no signs of harm. Blunt was acquitted. In Colorado and Washington, it's now completely legal for (human) adults to use marijuana. But veterinarians in these states are specifically prohibited by law from prescribing cannabis to animals, as one woman learned after driving to Colorado from Utah because she mistakenly believed she could obtain a medical marijuana prescription for her dog. There is no state in which it's legal for veterinarians to prescribe medical pot for dogs, although the Nevada legislature is debating a bill that would allow it. If you live in California, you can legally purchase Treatibles, dog treats that contain cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive compound in marijuana. The treats contain no THC, which is the compound that gets you high. The makers of Treatibles claim their treats can help aging dogs with aches and pains, just like medical marijuana can for humans. There isn't much legal precedent for stoned pets and their owners. Most weed ingested by pets is done so unbeknownst to the owner—usually a case of the pet getting into their owner's stash of edibles. In May, Robin Thicke and his girlfriend April Love Geary told TMZ their dog was hospitalized for ingesting marijuana, but no one alerted the authorities or complained about animal cruelty. Last August, a Michigan woman posted a video of her dog, who had accidentally ingested her marijuana, acting ""stoned,"" while the woman looked on and laughed. Viewers were outraged and posted thousands of comments accusing the woman of animal abuse. According to local news station WXYZ, Animal Control began an investigation into the case, but it appears no legal action was ever taken. It's much harder to find cases of owners intentionally getting their pets high (and owning up to it). I wondered if that might be because it's not exactly clear whether it's legal—or ethical, for that matter. I asked Suzanna Harman, an animal rights attorney, where she stood. Harman told me that if we're talking about criminal law, there's no law that specifically states that it's illegal for pet-owners to give their pets weed. ""There are different animal cruelty statutes in each state,"" Harman told me, ""so a judge would have to look at the facts of each individual case and see if the manner in which the pet guardian attempted to, or did, get the pet 'high' amounted to animal cruelty. This isn't to say that it won't one day be specifically outlawed, but it's such a new area right now, there are no statutes along those lines."" She also explained Blunt's case further: ""Under Illinois law, there are a few levels of animal abuse: cruel treatment, aggravated cruelty, and animal torture. Cruel treatment is defined as: [any] person or owner [who] beat[s], cruelly treat[s], torment[s], starve[s], overwork[s], or otherwise abuse[s] any animal. Aggravated cruelty is defined as: [any] person [who] intentionally commits an act that causes a companion animal to suffer serious injury or death. Animal torture is defined as: [any] person commits animal torture when that person without legal justification knowingly or intentionally tortures an animal."" Blunt was acquitted because his actions didn't fall under any of these categories. Harman also told me that there are subsections in most state animal cruelty laws that make exceptions for veterinarians. She told me, for example, that under Illinois law, ""the definition of animal torture does not include 'any alteration or destruction of any animal done by any person or unit of government pursuant to statute, ordinance, court order, or the direction of a licensed veterinarian.' So, if eventually medical marijuana was prescribed to pets by veterinarians, then that would account for an exception to any illegality of the pet guardian getting the pet 'high.'"" As I mentioned earlier, there are currently no states that legally allow veterinarians to prescribe marijuana to pets. In states where marijuana is legal for physicians to prescribe marijuana to humans, vets could still be criminalized for writing marijuana prescriptions for animals because, as Harman explained, ""there would have to be another law passed altogether on behalf of animals for it to be legally prescribed to them by veterinarians."" But, as she pointed out, marijuana statutes are very new, so it's not crazy to think it might be possible in the future. Aside from the legal implications, another big question is whether it's ethical to give your pets marijuana? I posed the question to Dr. Robert Goggs, a Doctor of Veterinary Science and lecturer at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine. He believes it would be ""misguided but not unethical for a pet owner to attempt to alleviate pain or distress in their own pet using medical marijuana,"" but adds that he'd much prefer the person seek veterinary advice before doing so. ""Veterinarians have access to a wide range of painkillers designed for and/or routinely used in animals that we know are safe, effective, and inexpensive,"" said Dr. Goggs. ""Why experiment with a drug that may not help and might harm when you can readily obtain safe and effective drugs instead?"" I also asked him about the effectiveness of the drug in animals. Are people like Blunt anthropomorphizing their pets by assuming they'll get high like we do? Speaking of anthropomorphizing your pets, Motherboard reports on people who freeze-dry their pets after they die. Dr. Goggs told me that ""the receptors for the active ingredient in cannabis and marijuana are found in the brain and in the other tissues of dogs, and probably cats too. We know that the drug produces signs of intoxication in both dogs and cats. This implies that the drug and its metabolites cross into the brain and affect the receptors—so you could say the drug is 'effective.'"" At the same time, ""there isn't really a safe dose for marijuana in dogs or cats, so it isn't sensible to try to use it."" Plus, Dr. Goggs added, ""plenty of veterinarians have seen dogs and cats become sick from eating their owners' pot edibles. Most pets will recover, but there is a chance that ingesting medical-grade pot could kill your pet."" For now, it's probably safest to avoid giving your pets marijuana. If they're suffering from physical pain, stick with the time-tested method of taking them to a vet. If they just seem bored, buying them a new toy is a lot safer—and cheaper—than giving them weed. And remember that pets can't tell time, so when the clock hits 4:20 each day, keep the weed to yourself. They'll be none the wiser.",there isn't really a safe dose for marijuana in dogs or cats

254,"HuffPost Hit Backspace, a new series from The Huffington Post, for a regular dose of pop culture nostalgia. They demand an answer, but offer none. ""Who let the dogs out? Who, who, who, who?"" ask the Baha Men, four times in succession. The group’s only major U.S. hit, ""Who Let The Dogs Out,"" dropped into the new millennium on July 25, 2000, as a cover of a calypso track already popular in the Caribbean. While it would only climb to No. 40 on the Billboard charts, the song became inescapable ― especially if you were a kid, or were raising one, at the time. Or if you often found yourself in sports stadiums. The track initially sold three million albums, yet its enigmatic refrain remained unresolved. Who let the dogs out? To know that, we first need to answer: Who are the dogs? According to Anslem Douglas, the Trinidad and Tobago native who wrote the original song in 1996, titled ""Doggie"" ― which was covered hideously by a British group before the Baha Men ― the dogs are badly behaved dudes. ""It’s a man-bashing song, it is,"" Douglas told The Huffington Post, explaining how his former brother-in-law often used the phrase. ""He used to come in and say, ‘Who let the dogs out?!’ And one time he asked me, ‘Why don’t you turn this into a song?’"" he explained. ""And the rest is history."" Although we suspected the words between the song’s riotous refrains may actually refer to women ― ""dog"" can be a derogatory term for either gender ― the lyrics back him up. After their first round of asking who, who, let the dogs out, the Baha Men sing: When the party was nice, the party was bumpin’ (Hey, Yippie, Yi, Yo) And everybody havin’ a ball (Hah, Ho, Yippie, Yi, Yo) I tell the fellas, ""Start the name callin’"" (Yippie, Yi, Yo) And the girls respond to the call ― the poor dog show up! The scene: a party. Douglas, however, explained that the party is merely a metaphor ― another way to say things were going swell, generally, in life. The speaker then calls on his male friends to engage in rude name-calling toward the women partygoers, who respond in turn. According to Douglas, it’s the women who then start calling the men ""dogs"" in each refrain. (He also told us the song is chiefly a lighthearted one, and that the lyrics weren’t necessarily meant for extended analysis.) In other lines, the speaker orders the ""ruffy,"" ""scruffy, ""flea-infested mongrel"" dogs to ""get back,"" but at one point changes his tune to defend his terrible friends from ""any girls calling them canine."" He vows to be calm in the face of such verbal abuse, prying the ""dummy"" women to just be chill, gawd. The next stanza, though, seemingly rejects male gender norms to suggest that ""a doggy is nuttin’"" if he doesn’t have ""a bone"" ― or a romantic partner. The last bit has the speaker seemingly worrying about a particular love interest in the sea of terrible prospects, ultimately puffing up his chest to call himself ""the man of the land"" and positioning himself as a sort of alpha. While the song bashes male ""dogs,"" the speaker admits he’s one of their pack. So, who let them all out? We asked Douglas point blank, along with Baha Men lead singer Isaiah Taylor and S-Curve founder Steven Greenberg, who recorded the track. ""I can’t answer that! If I answer that, people will stop asking,"" Douglas said, laughing. ""100 years from now, I will still not [have] answer[ed] that."" Greenberg responded similarly. ""I think that’s a question best left unanswered,"" the producer said. ""Why ruin it? Why get people to stop guessing?"" Taylor, though, had a different answer. ""I always say that that our drummer did that,"" he said, explaining how it became an inside joke among the Baha Men to accuse their bandmate. ""We say, ‘Hey, man, you let the dogs out!’"" No one asked us, but if they had, we might have suggested it had something to do with the persistent patriarchal systems that created a culture where men can behave badly with minimal consequence to their reputations or relationships.","""I think that’s a question best left unanswered,"" the producer said. ""Why ruin it? Why get people to stop guessing?"""
255,"It is scary and amazing to think that our lives could end at any moment, for there are few to no forces that are preventing us from contracting an illness or entering into any misfortune at any moment such as being hit by a vehicle. A life threatening situation can rise out of the blue at any moment, and sometimes it is via the most unexpected way that you can find out about your situation like one fire chief named John Angerstein did when he decided it was time to go get his hair cut. Most of the time, John Angerstein is the one saving lives. As a fire chief, he is rushing into burning buildings and cars regularly and wants to make sure that everybody is okay. This time around, John turned out needing some help and it was his barber who was able to come and save the day. John went and sat down for a haircut one day just as usual, but when his barber was trimming along the side of his right ear, his barber noticed that there was some type of mole on his scalp right above his ear area. He pointed it out, but John said that he also had other moles so he ignored the warning and then proceeded to go home. Later on, another person pointed out the darkened area above his ear, and that was the last straw for him. He called his dermatologist and set up an appointment for the next day so that he could have that situation sorted out once and for all. When he went to go see the dermatologist, he got some worried new because the doctor said that his affected area did not look good, and there was something bad that could come out of that. John was then sent to the Cancer Center in Houston. At the Cancer Center they found out that the mole located on him was actually an aggressive form of cancer and it needed to be operated on immediately in order to have some hope of surviving the situation. John’s life was now in danger in the blink of an eye and he had no idea what was in store for him. At the time, his wife was also away due to some family conditions so he was left with himself and his faith to cope with the struggles that would lie ahead of him. When he went to go get the skin cancer looked at and operated on, he learned that the cancer still had not spread to his lymph nodes, meaning that there was more chance that he will have an easy operation. When surgeons went in to remove the cancer, they were able to get it all out and allow John to have another chance at life. John says he wants people to listen to his story and learn that getting a physical is extremely important, and can make a huge difference when it comes to cancer treatment.

And finally that there’s nothing like Black girl Magic❤️"" Zanders told ABC News the the teacher later apologized, and that she harbors no bad blood towards him, adding that all she wanted to do was empower young African American girls.

264,"Students are graduating with more debt than ever before: about $33,000 for the average four-year college graduate with loans in the class of 2014. Indiana University, though, found a simple way to get students to borrow less: telling them how much they already owe when they're taking out loans for the next academic year. The university, where the average senior with loans graduated with nearly $29,000 in debt in 2012, began sending students letters each year telling them how much they'd already borrowed, what their interest rates were, and what their monthly payment would be after graduation. And in response, students seem to have borrowed less. It's too early to tell how much the behavior of individual borrowers changed, but in aggregate, students at IU took 11 percent less in federal loans during the 2013-'14 school year. Indiana is celebrating this as a success. The experiment indicates how little many students know about what their financial obligations will be after graduation. But it's not clear whether IU's solution gets at the root of the student debt problem: Are students really borrowing more than they need, or are there other factors driving high debt? Why student loan borrowers often don't know their monthly payment If you're taking out an auto loan or a mortgage, you already know what your monthly payment will be. If you're paying your credit card bill, there's a box on the statement telling you how long it will take to pay off the debt if you make only the monthly minimums. But student loans often don't come with such clear-cut information attached. That's because student debt doesn't accumulate all at once; it piles up in installments, year after year, often with different interest rates. And financial aid can be confusing. Students can borrow different types of federal loans, or combine federal loans with private loans from banks. All this can make it difficult to tell how much you'll owe and what your payments will be. Indiana tried to fix that with a one-page summary of what students owe so far, what kinds of loans they've taken out, and what their interest rate is. After the letters were sent, students started asking for more help to manage their student loan debt, James Kennedy, an associate vice president at IU, told a congressional committee in June. And the average debt for graduating seniors with loans dropped slightly between 2012 and 2013, from $28,769 to $27,619, even as average debts were increasing nationwide. Why are students borrowing so much? Some economists are concerned that student loan debt is making it harder for recent college graduates to buy houses and cars, as well as lessening the amount of money they have to spend and boost the economy. The Indiana University experience suggests that some students changed their behavior once they realized how much they were borrowing. But experts disagree about whether students who borrow more money than they really need is a widespread problem, or whether outside factors — like higher tuition prices — have made borrowing large amounts a true necessity. Some colleges argue that they don't have enough control over how much debt their students are taking on, and that this means some students are able to borrow more than they really need. Colleges can't change how much groups of students are allowed to borrow — so, for example, a student living at home can take on just as much debt as a student living in the dorms. The professional organization for college financial aid officials, the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, recommends that colleges should be allowed to set lower loan limits for some students, such as students attending less than full time. Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate education committee, agreed, saying in May that some students borrow too much and that he's looking into legislation that would allow colleges to limit it. Some researchers aren't so sure this is necessary. ""It’s hard to convincingly argue that overborrowing for an undergraduate degree is truly an epidemic,"" wrote Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University who studies financial aid. If anything, he said, his research suggests that students aren't always borrowing enough. About one-third of colleges underestimate the cost of living for their students by more than $3,000, and students can't borrow more than colleges say they'll need. That can seem counterintuitive in a time of concern about students with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt. But the most important factor for being able to pay back student loans is graduating from college. And for some students, taking out more loans means they'll have to work fewer hours and have more time to devote to their studies. Indiana's letter, and students' response, suggests that at least some students feel they could be more mindful about their borrowing. But going too far to discourage students from taking on debt could have unintended consequences of its own.",telling them how much they already owe when they're taking out loans for the next academic year

278,"When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote to the chief executives of all the S&P 500 companies in April asking them to lay off on stock buybacks and dividend payouts, he ignited a debate about shareholder value. Now, it's easy to point to activist investors as the villains who force boards to return cash to shareholders at the risk of damaging companies' long-term development. But activists are not the only ones pushing for heightened returns. Bloomberg's Alex Barinka reports that the CEOs of America's large cap companies have a lot to gain from it too. Of the 15 (non-Wall Street) companies that returned the most money to shareholders via buybacks last year, 11 based their chief executives' compensation on earnings per share, total shareholder return, or both, according to the report. So when a company like IBM spends money, say, buying back stock from investors, or paying out dividends, that tends to boost its share price. And when the share price goes up, so does the CEO's pay. In fact, IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty depends quite a bit on operating earnings per share – almost 40 percent of her pay package is based on it, according to Bloomberg. At Disney, CEO Bob Iger's performance-based stock award hinges both on total shareholder returns and earnings per share, compared with the S&P 500 index. It's a win-win. Unless, like Fink, you believe that there's more to a board's mandate than short-term payouts. ""Corporate leaders’ duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies’ shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long-term owners,"" Fink wrote in his April letter.","that tends to boost its share price.

283,"Since March, the nation's biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors. Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m — Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016 The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off. The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result. The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient. Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying In one sense, the long lines are good news: They're a sign of economic recovery as more people are flying. The number of Americans flying dropped precipitously as the recession began, and didn't recover to its 2007 level until 2014. But over the past year and a half, many more people have been flying: Nearly 900 million people passed through American airports in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. The number of people the TSA had to screen, since some of those passengers came from foreign airports, increased by 6 percent. At the same time, airplane tickets have gotten cheaper as oil prices have fallen. The average domestic plane ticket cost $363 last year, down 8 percent from 2014. It was less expensive to fly in 2015 than in any year since 2010. So far this year, both trends have continued. Overall passenger traffic increased 4 percent in January and 6 percent in February compared with 2014, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Some of the biggest airports — Denver, Los Angeles, New York's JFK, and San Francisco — have seen even bigger increases. Fares, too, are continuing to fall. Hopper, an app that tracks airline ticket prices, is predicting the lowest summer airfares since 2009. But more people flying also means more people in security lines. And TSA staffing hasn't kept up. There are 15 percent more people flying than in 2013, and the TSA has 12 percent fewer staff. Congress isn't wholly to blame for the budget cuts. The Department of Homeland Security's own budget request for the 2016 fiscal year proposed cutting 1,666 screeners' jobs, saying that ""risk-based screening practices"" — such as getting people signed up for TSA's PreCheck program, which allows you access to expedited security if you pass a background check and pay $85 — were making checkpoints more efficient. The goal, the department wrote, was to ""continue transitioning to a smaller, more skilled, professional workforce."" The agency now admits that this was a mistake, and is hiring 768 more screeners. Some airports want to solve the problem by hiring contractors to handle security rather than the TSA, though it's not clear if that would make much of a difference. Some airports with privatized security still have passengers reporting long lines, including San Francisco International and Rochester, New York: SFO TSA 5:30 am #ihatethewait (@ San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, CA) https://t.co/oIylCVd6km pic.twitter.com/ND5Bbt9ZuE — Matt Leung (@mattleung) May 25, 2016 Too long to get through security! Over 1 hr at ROC @asktsa 20 of us missed the flight #iHateTheWait https://t.co/iXzRm7jnUg — Erin Briggs, RN (@ErinBWellness) May 8, 2016 Lines weren't longer before because the TSA was sending people to expedited security As airline passenger counts were reaching record-breaking levels in 2014, the TSA also started hurrying people through its expedited security lanes. Since 2011, the TSA has offered PreCheck, which essentially offers pre-9/11 security for a price: Travelers at more than 150 airports keep their shoes and jackets on and their laptops and liquids in their bags, and they get to go through a regular metal detector rather than a body-scanning machine. But initially the program didn't catch on as widely as the TSA hoped. Most Americans aren't frequent fliers, and the program cost $85. By late 2014, fewer than half a million people had signed up for PreCheck, the Wall Street Journal reported. So in order to make sure the PreCheck lines were used, the TSA started routing regular passengers into them. In September 2013, just 10 percent of passengers got expedited screening — because they were over 70 or under 12, or because they were preapproved through PreCheck or Global Entry, a program focused on world travelers that allows them to get through customs more quickly. Then in October 2013, the TSA expanded PreCheck to people who hadn't directly signed up for it, and the number of people getting expedited security immediately tripled. There were a few ways to get PreCheck access without paying for it — you could be selected before arriving at the airport, based on the information you provide when you book your ticket, a program known as Secure Flight. Or you could be routed into the PreCheck lanes at the airport once you were already there, a program known as ""managed inclusion."" The TSA would randomly assign people to either normal or expedited security lines. TSA officers observing travelers' behavior could pull you out of the expedited line, and explosives detection hand swab machines and dogs were supposed to add an additional layer of security. The Government Accountability Office warned in March 2015 that these procedures hadn't been fully tested. Previous reports had suggested that the behavior detection officers aren't all that effective — a conclusion the TSA disagrees with. Still, at the time, the TSA was sending nearly half of all passengers to expedited screening, even though only about 7.2 million were actually qualified for PreCheck based on their background check, security clearance, or other factors: Expediting the security lines sped up security and reduced the need for TSA screeners. But it also meant that security itself was less thorough. And if there's one thing the American people hate more than long security lines, it's the idea that a terrorist might be able to get a knife, gun, or bomb onto an airplane. The TSA is trying to be less bad at its actual job: security Then, starting last summer, a report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general concluded that the TSA was very, very bad at its actual job. Although the report was supposed to be classified, some damning details leaked: 95 percent of attempts to sneak prohibited items through security were successful. The test results ""were disappointing and troubling,"" John Roth, the inspector general, said in congressional testimony in November. ""We found layers of security simply missing."" Randomly choosing passengers for PreCheck took a lot of heat. Congressional hearings featured one whistleblower who said the TSA was ""handing out PreCheck status like Halloween candy."" So in response, the TSA clamped down on security. It was obvious that this would lead to longer security waits, as Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA employee, wrote for the Guardian in June 2015: The greatest challenge when it comes to such failures stems from the fundamental catch-22 of the TSA’s mission: if agents properly execute their duties, then internal testing results will improve and airplanes might be slightly safer. But meticulous adherence to the TSA’s standard of practice will mean lines that back up to the ticketing counters. Flights will be missed due to the enormous security delays, and the distended passenger lines themselves will become choice terrorist targets. It’s a classic quantity-versus-quality dilemma. In October 2015, the TSA discontinued managed inclusion, the program that sends travelers into PreCheck lines at the airport and monitors them with behavior officers and explosive trace detectors. Starting last fall, the TSA and some reporters warned that lines were going to get longer. Washington, DC's airports noticed the change almost immediately, the Washington Post reported. ""I knew that would dramatically increase the number of people in the standard lanes,"" Peter Neffenger, the administration's head, said at congressional hearings this week. But the TSA had planned its budget assuming the expedited screening was going to continue. Since the uproar began about the long lines, Neffenger said the agency is holding daily calls with the busiest airports and has established a national command center to monitor security wait times.

Along with stripping nail polish, it turns out it can also do some pretty impressive damage to a polystyrene foam cup. This video, from Youtube channel LET'S MELT THIS, shows how this organic solvent can quickly break down a Styrofoam cup into what they call ""a melting glob of awesomeness."" The cup is made up of polystyrene foam, essentially a long interlocking chain of styrene monomers. When it’s exposed to acetone, the solvent breaks down that chain and releases all the trapped pockets of air, hence the fizzing gas and the appearance that it’s shrinking in size .","The cup is made up of polystyrene foam, essentially a long interlocking chain of styrene monomers.

306,"There are roughly 3.7 million vegans in the U.S., accounting for just over 1% of the population . Many go vegan to spare animals; the diet doesn't just cut out meat, like a vegetarian one, but nixes all animal sources of food, including eggs, dairy and honey. But if you’re wondering whether a vegan diet beats all others when it comes to your health, there’s a lot of room for debate. On the pro-vegan side of the ledger: A new study from Italy’s University of Florence linked vegetarian and vegan diets to significantly lower rates of ischemic heart disease and cancer. More research has tied vegan diets to healthier guts , gentler menopause symptoms and even lower levels of stress . When pitted against other popular diets—classic omnivorism, as well as vegetarianism and a form of it that allows for fish—the vegan plan also came out on top in terms of weight loss, according to a 2015 study from the University of South Carolina. Even when people failed to strictly follow their eating plan, those who attempted veganism tended to lose more weight than those who shot and missed for less-restrictive diets, says Gabrielle Turner-McGrievy, first author of the study. She says it’s possible people who try vegan diets learn how to swap in healthier plant-based dishes for their old meat-centric foods, which may help them lose weight even if they don’t ultimately stick with it. (For those considering veganism based on environmental or food supply concerns, Tuner-McGrievy has published more research to suggest vegan diets outperform others.) Combine all of those benefits with celebrity endorsements from the likes of Beyoncé and Ellen Degeneres, and ""going vegan"" seems like a no-brainer if you have the gustatory fortitude to stick with it. But dig into the research, and some holes appear. Regarding the study tying veganism to lower rates of total cancer and ischemic heart disease, the Italian team also found vegans do not enjoy benefits when it comes to total cardiovascular disease, death from cancer or death from any cause. ""Compared to the average American diet, a vegan diet looks very healthy, especially in the short term,"" says Loren Cordain, professor emeritus of health and human sciences at Colorado State University. ""But in the long-term, there aren’t any clear mortality benefits, and in fact [vegan diets] may be less healthy than diets than include meat."" It’s important to note that Cordain is one of the most high-profile proponents of Paleo-style diets , which many associate with heavy red meat consumption. (He wrote the book on Paleo , literally.) But, like most Paleo people, Cordain is not anti-plant. Instead, his research espouses a return to the diet pattern humans followed for most of our species’ existence: meats, plants, nuts and seeds, but not dairy or grains, especially those of the refined or processed variety. He points out (and research shows ) that it’s tough to adequately nourish your body with a strictly vegan menu. Iron, zinc, calcium and other essential nutrients are lacking in a vegetable-only diet. In particular, vitamin B12—a nutrient found mainly in eggs, fish and meat, and one that supports proper cell health—is a big concern for vegans. Research suggests upwards of 80% of vegans who do not take B12 supplements are deficient and may be at increased risk for heart disease, bone loss and other health issues as a result. ""The vegan diet should be well planned and needs to pay specific attention to B12, which is not the case for the diet containing small amounts of meat, dairy and eggs,"" says Peter Clarys, chair of human biology at Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium. Clarys's research ranks vegan diets highly in several areas of health. But he says including small amounts of meat, dairy and eggs in a vegetable-based diet is ""not unhealthy."" Cordain agrees, and points out that America’s skyrocketing rates of obesity and metabolic disease have coincided with our adoption of a diet heavy in processed grains and refined sugars. ""I hate to state the obvious, but we’ve been eating meat forever, so that’s not causing the obesity or diabetes epidemics,"" he says. If that clashes with the reports you’ve heard tying red meat to heart disease and cancer, the latest research on saturated fat and colon cancer has called many of those ties into question. Some research suggests that refined carbohydrates are a more likely suspect. Vegan diets are a massive improvement over the refined carb and sugar-heavy eating patterns to which many Americans adhere. But for optimal health and longevity, you’re probably best off eating a diet heavy in plants with a little meat, fish, and eggs on the side.","Vegan diets are a massive improvement over the refined carb and sugar-heavy eating patterns to which many Americans adhere.

311,"Pushbullet is a popular service that lets you quickly share links, files and messages between your smart devices and your regular desktop OS. Better still, the free service also lets you see Android app notifications on the Ubuntu desktop! How? Well, that depends. There are two main ways to get Pushbullet notifications to show up on your Ubuntu desktop. Both have their pros and cons. The Official Method: Browser Extensions The official (and recommended) way to use Pushbullet on your desktop is via the browser, by way of a free Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on. The drawback here is that your browser needs to be running to catch and display notifications. This is not always practical, and the notifications you’ll see are (by default) browser-based notifications and not native system ones. A neat workaround for Firefox users is to install the Pushbullet add-on and then enable the notify-osd extension we told you about recently – all Pushbullet notifications will then show up as native Ubuntu notifications. Naturally there are (plenty) more features offered through the browser extensions, including link sharing, device browsing and more, but we’re solely focusing on the ability to see notifications in this post. The Alternative Method: The Unofficial App A new app called PB for Desktop offers an alternative to the browser-based add-on method. It’s billed as a free and open-source desktop client for Pushbullet, and is totally unofficial, too. Its developer says he created the cross-platform app out of an ""unwillingness to run Chrome for receiving non-native notifications. I set out to implement the core user experience of receiving native notifications on the basis of a lightweight wrapper."" For an app based on letting you see notifications there is, as of writing, one big ""drawback"": it doesn’t support Android notification mirroring. This is one of the most useful features of Pushbullet. It lets you see app alerts, SMS messages, WhatsApp notification, etc. on the desktop. PB for Desktop can, however, display other notifications you send, such as links, files and the like, and integrates nicely with the official Pushbullet web app. PB for Desktop features: Native desktop push notifications Small resource footprint Simple Setup Channel-specific notification images Notification image thumbnails Custom notification sound Pushbullet Notifications Getting Set Up First things first, you need to install the Pushbullet app on the Android phone or tablet you want to interface with, regardless of which method (1 or 2) you plan to use to see them on Ubuntu. Install the official Pushbullet app on your Android device from Google Play: The Android app will then offer on-screen instructions to walk you through the configuration and set up required to allow (among other things) notification mirroring and Remote Files. 1. Using the Official Pushbullet Browser Extensions If you’re using Google Chrome, Chromium, or Vivaldi you should install the official Pushbullet Chrome extension: Pushbullet on the Chrome Web Store If you’re using Mozilla Firefox (or a Firefox-based web browser like GNU IceCat) you should install the official Pushbullet Firefox add-on: Pushbullet on Mozilla Add-Ons Once installed you should click on the toolbar icon and log in using the same Google or Facebook account you used when you installed Pushbullet on your phone or tablet. 2. Using the PB for Desktop App If you plan to skip using the browser and instead use the PB for Desktop app, you’ll need to download the proper installer GitHub project page. Download Latest version of PB for Desktop The developer cautions that the app is currently somewhere between beta and stable quality-wise. Don’t install the app if you can’t handle the odd bug or glitch! Install PB for Desktop using your preferred method. Once done, open it from the Unity Dash by searching for ""pushbullet"". The first time you open the app it will ask you to log in. Make sure you use the same Google or Facebook account you used when you installed Pushbullet on your phone. The developer is open to new ideas, suggestions and improvements, which can be made on the GitHub project page.",A neat workaround for Firefox users is to install the Pushbullet add-on and then enable the notify-osd extension

313,"Researchers said the signs of a cognitive slow-down were not a pre-cursor to a decline in other areas of a woman's health A new study has suggested women start losing their memory and the ability to think as quickly in their fifties, an age range earlier than previously thought.  Researchers from UCLA and Brandeis university studied over 2,000 women in their forties for 10 years after menopause and found their cognitive speed declined by five per cent over the ten year period. Their verbal episodic memory also declined by two per cent in the ten years. The women were measured every one to two years for an average of six and a half years.  ""Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive ageing in midlife women, with substantial with-woman declines in processing speed and memory,"" they wrote in the study published in PLOS ONE. The study found there was ""cognitive ageing in women in midlife, with significant longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal memory"".  The authors noted that previous studies have not consistently measured cognitive performance in those under 60 and said that following their results further research is needed to identify factors which could influence the decline rates and to develop interventions which could slow cognitive ageing. They also said that while these changes happened around the time of menopause, they did not think the cognitive slow-down was due to these hormonal changes as they ""did not see a sharp acceleration of cognitive decline during or after the menopause transition"". Researchers also said the signs of cognitive ageing were not a pre-cursor of a decline in other areas of a woman’s general health and wellbeing.  Men were not surveyed during the study but previous studies have suggested men over 40 have worse memories than women of the same age and that women are generally better at remembering conversations than men.","A new study has suggested women start losing their memory and the ability to think as quickly in their fifties, an age range earlier than previously thought."

Here are the deets: showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss revealed on a podcast that they originally had an idea for an incredible way to shoot a battle scene starring Peter Dinklage AKA Tyrion Lannister: ""Thinking back to season one, there was supposed to be this big battle [where] Tyrion Lannister follows The Mountain into combat—and we were really excited. We were going to have the camera at Peter Dinklage’s eye level and have him follow this giant, The Mountain, into battle and just see everything. Frankly, we just run out of money and we couldn’t do it. So that was one of the big battles from the book that we hoped we could get on screen and we never managed to do it."" Can. You. Imagine? Not only was this a major battle scene that would have been amazing to see in the show, but to see it through Tyrion’s eyes? Beyond. If it’s any consolation, David and Dan don’t regret not doing the scene in hindsight. ""In a way, I think it’s probably better that we couldn’t do it, because it never would have measured up to what we were able to do later."" (Case in point?

317,"The earliest known toothbrushes date back to 3500 B.C., found in Egyptian tombs next to their owners. They're pieces of stick, really, with frayed ends to whisk away debris. But the fact that the Egyptians thought to pack a toothbrush on their trip to the afterlife hints at one of the most vexing problems throughout human history: How do we get gunk out of our teeth? Archaeologically speaking, it's a difficult question to answer. Cavemen dentists were notoriously poor record keepers. And while bones can survive the march of time, biological material like chewed food isn't as hearty. That makes it hard to know, say, what a cavewoman ate for dinner on a chilly night in northern Spain, or whether she preferred Colgate or Crest. Karen Hardy may have cracked the mystery, literally, by breaking down calcified plaque from some of the oldest human remains in Europe. ""The dental plaque is a film that covers your teeth and that's why you have to brush your teeth every day,"" she told The Washington Post. ""If not, it hardens and becomes calcified. Within about 10 days, it’s attached onto your tooth as this extremely hard material that you can’t get off unless you go to the dentist."" If you can't make it to the dentist, you could also have an archaeologist chisel some off your teeth a million years from now. That's what Hardy did with a fossil from the Sima del Elefante archaeological site in Atapuerca, a mountainous region in northern Spain. The site ""contains a rich fossil record of the earliest human beings in Europe,"" according to UNESCO. The bones provide ""an invaluable reserve of information about the physical nature and the way of life of the earlier human communities."" Researchers also found painted and engraved panels on the cave walls, complete with hunting scenes and animal figures. But Hardy had a specific goal: She wanted to know what those early humans put in their mouths. Modern technology and a million-year-old mandible helped her find out. She scraped off some of the calcified plaque, then broke it down to find microscopic evidence of what was preserved inside. Turns out, a lot. She was able to discern that they ate grass, seeds, other plants and meat — all raw, indicating they didn't yet use fire to cook. She also found spores, tiny insect fragments and pollen grains — things they inhaled because they likely lived in a forest. But the most compelling thing were pieces of indigestible wood fibers. Hardy believes they're from small sticks early humans would jam in their teeth to clean them. ""We all get stuff stuck between our teeth,"" she said. ""I haven’t done the experiment of eating raw meat, but if you think about all the fibers and the tendons in meat, it would probably be worse with a raw diet."" Researchers like Hardy have spent a lot of time exploring how people kept their teeth clean throughout history. People who lived in Sudan 2,000 years ago, for example, chewed purple nutsedge, a bitter weed whose antibacterial properties warded away cavity-causing bacteria, according to National Geographic. Our oldest ancestors had great teeth, despite the lack of toothbrushes, toothpaste and lies to dentists about daily flossing. But as humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming, tooth-decaying bacteria that feast on carbohydrates proliferated in human mouths, according to NPR. The industrial revolution made things worse, pumping sugar and processed flour into our diets. Our teeth are whiter and straighter than our ancestors' but also more likely to develop cavities. We've also replaced sticks with dental floss, although an Associated Press study recently cast serious doubt on the practice. Researchers have long suspected that early humans wedged sticks into their teeth to clean them, Hardy said. Chimpanzees, which are connected to humans via a common ancestor, use sticks and pieces of grass to clean between their teeth. And ancient fossils of teeth have tiny holes on the sides, called interproximal grooves, that are likely caused by repeated cleanings with sticks. Hardy insists her findings are from a small data set — the plaque from one fossil. But her research is able to be replicated because of the hearty nature of the film on our teeth. ""Once it's there it stays there,"" she said. ""It's kind of like a tattoo of biological information — a personal time capsule.""",Hardy believes they're from small sticks early humans would jam in their teeth to clean them
318,"WASHINGTON - You can forget about the birds and the bees. If you really want to learn how babies are made, you need to know about Juno and Izumo. Fertilization takes place when an egg cell and a sperm cell recognize one another and fuse to form an embryo. But how they recognize each other in order to hook up had remained a mystery. Researchers said on Wednesday they have identified a protein on the egg cell's surface that interacts with another protein on the surface of a sperm cell, allowing the two cells to join. This protein, dubbed Juno in honor of the ancient Roman goddess of fertility and marriage, and its counterpart in sperm, named Izumo after a Japanese marriage shrine, are essential for reproduction in mammals including people, they said. This new understanding of the role of these two proteins could help improve the treatment of infertility and guide the development of new contraceptives, the researchers said. ""By identifying this interaction between Juno and Izumo, we now know the identity of the receptor proteins found on the surface of our father's sperm and our mother's egg that must interact at the moment at which we were conceived,"" said Gavin Wright of the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in Britain, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature. The researchers are now screening infertile women to try to determine whether problems with the Juno receptor are to blame. ""It is remarkable that about 20 percent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause,"" said Enrica Bianchi of the Sanger Institute, another of the researchers. ""We are now asking whether Juno is involved in these cases of unexplained infertility,"" Bianchi added. Wright said that if defects in the Juno receptor are in fact implicated in human infertility, a simple, non-invasive genetic screening test could be developed to identify affected women. ""This then would allow us to guide the fertility treatment,"" Wright said, letting affected women proceed directly to a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection involving direct injection of sperm into an egg obtained from in vitro fertilization. Japanese researchers identified the sperm cell's Izumo protein in 2005, but the identity of its counterpart on the egg cell had remained elusive. The Sanger Institute researchers made an artificial version of Izumo to try to find an answer, and found that it interacted with Juno to initiate fertilization. They then developed mice that lacked Juno. The females of these mice were infertile because their egg cells did not fuse with sperm. The Japanese researchers earlier had shown that male mice lacking the Izumo sperm protein were also infertile. In the new study, the researchers detected a quick loss of the Juno protein from the egg's surface after fertilization. They said this may account for how a fertilized egg blocks out additional sperm cells, preventing formation of embryos with more than one sperm cell that would not be viable.","a protein on the egg cell's surface that interacts with another protein on the surface of a sperm cell, allowing the two cells to join"
320,"Get ready for AI to show up where you’d least expect it. In 2016, tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft launched dozens of products and services powered by artificial intelligence. Next year will be all about the rest of the business world embracing AI. Artificial intelligence is a 60-year-old term, and its promise has long seemed like it was forever over the horizon. But new hardware, software, services and expertise means it’s finally real -- even though companies will still need plenty of human brain power to get it working. The most sophisticated incarnation of AI today is an approach called deep learning that’s based on neural network technology inspired by the human brain. Conventional computer programs follow a prewritten sequence of instructions, but there’s no way programmers can use that approach for something as complex and subtle as describing a photo to a blind person. Neural networks, in contrast, figure out their own rules after being trained on vast quantities of real-world data like photos, videos, handwriting or speech. AI was one of the hottest trends in tech this year, and it’s only poised to get bigger. You’ve already brushed up against AI: It screens out spam, organizes your digital photos and transcribes your spoken text messages. In 2017, it will spread beyond digital doodads to mainstream businesses. ""It’ll be the year of the solution as opposed to the year of the experiment,"" said IBM Chief Innovation Officer Bernie Meyerson. It’s enough of a thing that some are concerned about the social changes it could unleash. President Barack Obama even raised the issue of whether AI might push us to adopt a universal basic income so people other than CEOs and AI programmers benefit from the change. New AI adopters next year will include banks, retailers and pharmaceutical companies, predicted Andrew Moore, dean of Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science. For example, an engineering firm might want to use AI to predict bridge failures based on the sounds from cars traveling across it. Previously, the firm would have needed to hire a machine-learning expert, but now a structural engineer could download AI software, train it with existing acoustic data, and get a new diagnostic tool, Moore said. On 60 Minutes Overtime, Charlie Rose explores the labs at Carnegie Mellon on the cutting edge of A.I. See robots learning to go where humans can'... AI should reach medicine next year, too, said Monte Zweben, chief executive of database company Splice Machine and former deputy AI chief at NASA’s Ames Research Center. That could mean fatigue-free bots that scan medical records to spot dangerous infections early or customize cancer treatments for a patient’s genes -- tasks that assist human staff but don’t replace those people. ""Precision medicine is becoming a reality,"" Zweben said, referring to treatments customized for an individual to an extent that’s simply not feasible today. A similar digital boost awaits white-collar workers, predicted Eric Druker, a leader of the analytics practice at consulting firm Booz Allen. Assessing whether borrowers are worthy of a mortgage is a standardized process, ""but humans are making decisions at every step,"" he said. In 2017, AI will be able to speed many of those decisions by doing some of the grunt work, he said. Cars increasingly are becoming rolling computers, so of course the auto industry -- under competitive pressure from Silicon Valley -- is embracing AI. Companies like Tesla Motors offer increasingly sophisticated self-driving technology, but drivers still must keep their hands on the wheel. Next year, though, the technology will graduate out of the research phase, predicted Dennis Mortensen, chief executive of AI scheduling bot company X.ai. ""One of the dozen or so serious self-driving initiatives will roll out a truly fully autonomous feature,"" though confined to highway driving, he said. Why is it getting easier? Google and Facebook in 2016 released their core AI programs as open-source software anyone can use. Amazon Web Services, the dominant way companies tap into computing power as needed, added an artificial intelligence service. The computers are ready with a few mouse clicks and a credit card. But to Chris Curran, chief technologist of consulting firm PwC Consulting, AI will remain confined to narrow tasks like recognizing speech. A general artificial intelligence -- something more like our own brains -- remains distant. ""Data science bots -- something you could ask any question and it’ll figure it out -- are farther away,"" he said. It’s the direction Google is heading with Google Assistant -- which arrived in 2016 in its Google Allo chat app, Google Home smart speaker and Google Pixel phone -- but it’s far from the ultimate digital brain. Tech companies will push the state of the art further next year. Among the examples: And maybe we’ll stop feeling like such dorks when talking to our phones and TVs. ""The tech arbiters of style,"" Tepper said, ""are pushing hard to make it easier for people to talk to their devices and look cool while doing it.""

This is an academic book — Harvard University Press published it — but Hamilton writes with a conversational immediacy that makes it profoundly readable; I finished most of it on a single train ride last week. Hamilton writes about the most constantly discussed artists in popular music history — the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Hendrix — in ways that make their music sound new. And the story he tells is a sweeping and troubling one, a real warning about how white cultural imperialism can just completely plunder some of the most vital art in the world. Anyway, Hamilton is a rap guy just like me, so I thought it would be fun — in the spirit of this email conversation with Shea Serrano — to talk about whether the same thing that happened to rock ‘n’ roll could happen to rap music. In recent years, white rappers have become an increasingly powerful commercial force, and, as Jon Caramanica explores in this great Times piece, they’ve often done it in ways that cut out black audiences. If you can stand the spectacle of two white guys hand-wringing over white takeover of black music, let’s look at the question of whether rap music could ever become white music. TOM BREIHAN: Your book tells a lot of stories, but its main overarching narrative is about how, over the course of the ’60s, rock ‘n’ roll music went from being a place where black musicians could find fame and success to being perceived as a primarily white form of music. At the time, writers were even talking about how white musicians were being truer to the spirit of black music like the blues than black musicians were. And you make the point that this happened specifically in rock, whereas other forms of traditionally black music like jazz and rap have largely avoided it. But how do you think rap, specifically, has avoided becoming a white-dominated genre? And could that still happen? JACK HAMILTON: Man, that’s a great question. I don’t really see it happening with rap, for a number of reasons. For starters, rock ‘n’ roll music in its 1950s form, when it first burst into the public consciousness, was quite interracial. There were really always both white and black rock ‘n’ roll stars, for as long as that term had been in existence. That right there makes it pretty different from hip-hop. There’s also the fact that hip-hop starts out as a subculture that’s firmly rooted in a specific place and takes a pretty long time to turn ""mainstream."" There’s about six years between Kool Herc’s legendary Sedgwick Ave. party and ""Rapper’s Delight,"" whereas rock ‘n’ roll really starts as mass culture — in its early years the music itself is pretty amorphous, and the term is often being used to describe a broad commercial phenomenon rather than a specific musical one. I think hip-hop’s roots as a subculture have given it a real specificity with relation to certain categories of identity. Lastly, the Caribbean migrant roots of hip-hop are massively important, which really sets it apart from previous forms of American popular music; I’m not totally sure how that’s affected this particular question, but I’m sure that it probably has. But maybe the biggest thing is that if it were going to happen to rap I think it already would have. What’s interesting with rock is that the ""whitening"" happens really quite quickly — if you set the birth of rock ‘n’ roll in the early-to-mid 1950s, by the mid-to-late 1960s black performers are already being pushed to the genre’s margins. Hip-hop’s already over 40 years old, and white rappers are still very much the exception rather than the rule. TOM BREIHAN: But they’re becoming less and less of the exception, and in the past few years this whole white-rap ecosystem has sprung up, completely parallel to rap’s traditionally black audiences and delivery systems, almost entirely separate. I’m sure you saw Jon Caramanica’s Times article about white rappers and the way so many of them have chosen to studiously ignore questions of race lately. That’s kind of a troubling new development. Do you think we could ever get to the point where there’s a mainstream white rap and an alternate black rap world? Or did rap spend so long developing as a form of black art that it’ll always be, on some level, culturally black? JACK HAMILTON: I guess it’s possible that we’ll get to the point where the mainstream is dominated by white performers, but I think that’s a long way off, and I think if that happens something about the genre’s status on the whole will have already shifted to make it more culturally marginal. One possibility is that it might go the way of jazz, a genre that for the past 50-60 years has been increasingly populated by non-black musicians and yet whose ""pantheon"" is still dominated by black musicians — ask the average person on the street to name a famous jazz musician and chances are they’ll rattle off Miles, Ellington, Coltrane, Louis Armstrong, and quite a few more before they get to, say, Bill Evans or even Benny Goodman. But again, I think we’re a pretty long way away from even something like that happening, and it’s certainly been a really long time since jazz was the dominant popular music in America, as hip-hop still very much is (at least, I’d argue it is). Maybe I’m being naive, but I don’t see the cultural connotation of rap being a predominantly black art form really changing anytime soon, and certainly not nearly as quickly and drastically as it did with rock. TOM BREIHAN: One thing that really struck me about the book was the passage about how certain rock critics, in the late ’60s, were writing that white musicians were the ones keeping the spirit of the blues alive while black musicians were reaching for crass commercialism instead. In hindsight, it seems fucking insane that any white critic would’ve ever had the temerity to spout obvious racism like that. But I can remember a moment, in the late ’90s and early ’00s, where certain corners of the rap music held up white underground rappers like, say, Aesop Rock as paragons of authenticity, keeping rap music rooted in artistry, while holding those rappers up against popular black rappers who were only in it for the money or whatever. At that point, people knew better than to use racialized language, but it was right under the surface. Did those echoes occur to you when you were finding those old quotes from ’60s critics? JACK HAMILTON: Yeah, definitely. One thing that does bug the hell out of me is when white writers and musicians cast themselves as preservationists of ""real"" black music, which I think you can see in some corners of throwback soul and R&B music these days as well. There’s something sort of smug and smarmy about it to me, and frankly just uncreative, too. I definitely had that reaction to that Macklemore video where he surrounds himself with Grandmaster Caz and all those old-school guys — like, on one hand, it’s great those guys are getting paid and getting a spotlight, but on the other hand there’s a particular sort of ""work"" that’s doing for Macklemore in the eyes of his fans that makes me really uncomfortable. I think it’s a similar impulse to people who ran their mouths about how, say, Eric Clapton was the last hope for the blues in the late 1960s. [Note: You should really read Jack’s ""fuck Macklemore"" piece.] TOM BREIHAN: Another point you make in the book is that early rock ‘n’ roll was a product of a kind of cultural conversation, with musicians of different races influencing each other — something that continued up through the ’60s, with the Beatles and Motown leaving their mark on each other up through Revolver. One amazing thing about rap music, to me, is that it’s never been subject to that same kind of conversation. Rap artists, from the very beginning, have been able to absorb influences from whatever white artists they were sampling; Kraftwerk is the great early example. But throughout the years, whenever white artists from outside of rap have tried to absorb rap influences, it’s mostly turned out to be a Limp Bizkit type of shitshow. Do you have any ideas on why that might be? JACK HAMILTON: I actually only think that’s the case when it comes to rapping itself — I agree that most rap/rock hybrids have been pretty terrible. But hip-hop influences on the whole, particularly from a more instrumental/musical standpoint, have been hugely influential on a ton of rock music and many other non-hip-hop genres. There are so many examples, but someone like Beck immediately springs to mind. And just in general programmed drums and samplers and things like that, whose uses were often pioneered by hip-hop artists, are all over all types of popular music these days, including rock. I’m not sure why rapping itself hasn’t often worked when transported to other genres — maybe someone just hasn’t done it all that well yet? TOM BREIHAN: One last question: You figured out a way to slip Kanye West a copy of your book. Has he told you what he thought of it yet? JACK HAMILTON: Hahahahahaha. Not yet, but I will admit I am keeping an eye on Twitter. Jack’s book is available here, and he’s also doing a five-part Slate Academy podcast about it, which you can check out here. FURIOUS FIVE 1.

334,"Quitting smoking could bring your risk of dying from a heart attack down to the same level as someone who's never smoked before, a new study suggests. However, past smokers aren't totally out of the woods -- researchers found that they still are more likely to have blocked coronary arteries, which is considered a risk factor for heart attack. The research was presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2013. ""Our study was the first to demonstrate that the presence and severity of coronary blockages do not go away with quitting smoking, but that the risk of heart attack and death does,"" study researcher Dr. James K. Min said in a statement. The study is based on data from 13,372 people from nine countries who were part of the Coronary CT Evaluation for Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter Study. Of those people, 2,853 were active smokers, 3,175 were past smokers, and 7,344 people had never smoked. Researchers found that the probability of having a severe blockage or narrowing of one and two major heart arteries was 1.5 times higher in people who had smoked in the past or currently smoked. And the probability of having a severe blockage or narrowing in all three major heart arteries was two times higher in people who had smoked in the past or currently smoked. However, the rate of heart attack or death from heart attack was the same among past smokers and never-smokers, with current smokers having a two-fold higher rate of heart attack or death from heart attack than never- or past-smokers. But there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered about the findings, Min said. ""For example, will the severe blockages observed in patients who have quit smoking provoke adverse events after two years (the duration of the present study),"" he said in the statement. ""Further, does the duration of smoking or the number of cigarettes smoked per day affect the severity of CAD or the prognosis related to quitting smoking. Our team and several others are pursuing such investigations."" A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine gave more proof to the concept of quitting smoking as soon as possible -- it showed that stopping the habit before age 40 ""gives back almost all of the decade of lost life from continued smoking,"" study researcher Dr. Prabhat Jha, a professor in the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. ""That’s not to say, however, that it is safe to smoke until you are 40 and then stop,"" Jha added in the statement. ""Former smokers still have a greater risk of dying sooner than people who never smoked. But the risk is small compared to the huge risk for those who continue to smoke."" Indeed, another study presented at the same ESC Congress showed that even smokers who seem to live long lives still have shorter lifespans because of the habit. The research showed that even if you make it to age 70, you will still lose four years of life, on average, if you smoke.",Quitting smoking could bring your risk of dying from a heart attack down to the same level as someone who's never smoked before

One of the reasons Apple gave was to save space inside of the iPhone 7 for other components. Given that the headphone jack has been replaced by a second speaker grille on the device, you may think that perhaps that space was taken up by a second speaker. However, it turns out that is not the case at all. teardown of the iPhone 7 performed by iFixit has revealed that the additional speaker grille appears to only be there for aesthetic purposes and doesn’t actually serve any practical purpose. Image source: iFixit To be fair to Apple, they did not claim that there would be two speakers at the bottom of the iPhone 7. However, the new phone does tout stereo audio now, with an additional speaker at the top of the device. On top of that, the space previously occupied by the headphone jack has been used up by a larger haptic feedback engine and slightly larger battery. The haptic feedback engine now has two uses in the iPhone 7, delivering 3D Touch as well as simulating clicks for the home button, which explains why it needed to be bigger.

That's in keeping with recent history, as the Yankees have not scored a run since the ninth inning of Wednesday's game. On Thursday, they were blanked by Blake Snell and a pair of Rays relievers in just two hours and 37 minutes. On Friday, they got keel-hauled by the Jays, 9-0. And Saturday you witnessed above. Over that span, the Yankees have batted .152 as a team and gone 0 for 16 with runners in scoring position.

Those eight games, it so happens, will come against the Blue Jays (2), Red Sox (3), and Orioles (3). Tough way to finish, that. Coming into Saturday, the SportsLine Projection System gave the Yankees just a 0.5 percent chance of making the postseason.

358,"This post originally appeared on VICE UK. We share apartments with people we don't know or with our parents, live hand-to-mouth, and subscribe to a culture of anxiety. We struggle with self esteem and live our social lives online. We know what we should be because we learned it from our parents, who got married when they were our age and had kids, a mortgage, and a hatchback just a few years later. But us? We're fully grown adults living in a state of suspended childhood. So what happens in 20 years when we're all nearly middle-aged? What happens when millennials grow up? One image immediately comes to mind: a single 43-year-old burdened with mental-health issues, living in a shoebox apartment that costs $2,500 a month, scrolling obsessively through Tinder, and tweeting about the latest Palace drop to an audience of desperately lonely peers. But really, it's uncharted territory; no one really knows. Of the tens of academics, scientists, and economists I emailed, most didn't want to hypothesize—although in many ways, this unsavory tableau probably isn't too far off the mark. We're broke now, and we're likely to be living hand-to-mouth in later life, too. Ryan Bourne, head of Public Policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says that our generation will go into our 40s with far less accumulated wealth and be much poorer than we should be. ""This lack of wealth is partly because millennials won't own housing, but partly because they'll have always paid so much for rent that it's quite difficult to save anything to even build up to a pension, or savings and investment. That is a big problem."" Generational expert Jason Dorsey agrees: ""We're expecting to have people in their 30s and 40s still relying heavily on their parents—30-somethings who still live at home and 40-somethings whose parents still pay for their cellphone bill. That phenomenon is putting pressure on the older generation. Unless income increases dramatically, we'll be in trouble."" Basically, if you thought being in your 20s was high pressure, look forward to the latter end of your 30s and your early 40s. Bourne thinks we'll hit a point in our so-called middle age and realize the gravity of our situation. ""The risk there is that a lot of people in our generation will get into their 40s and panic that they really haven't got enough accumulated assets to live on in 30 years time when they retire,"" he explains. ""So you'll get a lot of people worrying in their 40s that they might not have a particularly happy retirement."" Will we ever catch up to our parents' standards of living and accumulated wealth? According to the economists I spoke to, probably not. ""The problem is we'll still chase many of the same things that other generations want, but it's more out of reach,"" explains Dorsey. ""As our cohort enter their mid-to-late 30s, it'll be an interesting time to see if millennials achieve this idea of adulthood."" VICE readers' number one fear is not finding love, which suggests we're not completely put off the idea of marriage, and our anger at the housing crisis shows—somewhat unsurprisingly—that we still value having a secure place to live. As we wait for these traditional markers of adulthood going into our 30s, said Dorsey and others I spoke to, we're likely to continue to be frustrated and unhappy. At this age, because we're not able to afford having children, we'll be looking to have them in our late 30s and early 40s. ""Having kids in your late 30s is more difficult and higher risk, and we believe there is going to be a lot of pressure around that time to get married and have kids,"" says Dorsey. ""It's a perfect storm. The mood will be: If you are going to do it, you have to do it now. And, for the obvious reason that it's going to be more difficult and more challenging, it's going to create a different kind of conversation. You may end up with people having less kids overall, because if they start later maybe, they can only have fewer."" The psychological burden of that will lay with women—some of whom will find they can't have children—but it'll be felt throughout society. As Dr. Amy Kaler, professor of social structure at the University of Alberta, told VICE, if women stopped having children, ""We'd first notice the collapse of economic activity that requires young children and parents, stores for babies, nannies, day cares. Then an upward ripple in elementary schools, kids' sports. We'd also become completely dependent on immigration to continue to exist, as a country. We'd see more efforts to attract immigrants—young immigrants—to bring more people in."" Dr. Carole Easton—chief executive of Young Women's Trust, which supports and represents women aged 16 to 30 struggling to live on low or no pay in England and Wales—is particularly concerned for the future of women. ""The reason women will struggle more, in our view,"" she says, ""is because over their lives they'll get paid less, they're more likely to be stuck in low paid and insecure jobs, and, importantly, they're more likely to be the main carers for family members."" No one would ever be able to predict what our mental health and well-being will look like in 20 years, but it's likely that we'll remain a generation characterized by anxiety and mental health—particularly considering our openness when it comes to discussing these topics. But we should be concerned by the prevalence of mental illness in our 20s. As a general rule, the quicker mental-health issues are dealt with, the more likely you are to recover and have better or better-managed mental health in the future. ""Leaving symptoms untreated can not only result in unnecessary suffering for the individual, but interfere with building a rich and meaningful life moving forward,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Lisa Orban. With regards to the anxiety millennials report in their 20s, she says, ""The brain is still malleable in young adulthood, and exposure to stress in one's environment early on can have an impact on the course of one's mental health. If young adults learn how to identify stress and develop adaptive coping strategies early on, chances are they will be more proficient at handling stress, which can prevent or mitigate mental-health symptoms in the future."" But how successful have we been at developing coping mechanisms? What mental-health professionals are concerned about is that we don't know the long-term effects of living in our ""suspended adolescence."" Lucy Lyus at mental-health charity MIND says, ""We know that everything happening to young people at the moment contributes to a lack of well-being and can lead to anxiety. Obviously it's worrying to know what is going to happen when this generation grows up."" Lyus adds that none of these contributing lifestyle factors are going to change soon. It's in the balance: If we want to improve the future mental health of millennials, changes need to happen now. ""We know that the government will say that they are committed to making mental health as much of a priority as physical health, and have committed a billion pounds over the next five years to make that happen,"" she says. ""But we don't actually know how it's going to go."" At least in our miserable middle age we can look forward to a long retirement, right? Not exactly. We'll work longer than any generation yet, partially because we'll be supporting the children we had late in life until much later—an issue compounded by the fact the government is hell-bent on us working right up to the brink of death. ""The state pension age is going to have to rise dramatically for us because of an aging population,"" explains Bourne. ""The government essentially introduced this triple-lock mechanism that makes the state pension even more generous, and that makes no sense when you've got an aging population. Something's got to give on that, and the most obvious thing to do would be to raise the state pension age very substantially."" Already retirement ages are scheduled to rise to 66 in October of 2020 in the UK and, under current government proposals, 67 between 2026 and 2028, and 68 between 2044 and 2046. We don't know how much higher those could go. This all sounds very doom and gloom, but conveniently we as a generation don't exist in a bubble. We can't be ignored, and these issues—housing, lack of savings, mental health, and so on—left to fester. Eventually the knock-on effects will become a burden and our social and financial issues have to take priority. ""The contemplation of what's going to happen if we don't fix all of these problems is almost too awful to think about,"" says Rachel Laurence from the think tank New Economics Foundation. ""I think if we really don't fix most of them, there will be a major economic crash and a massive depression. But I hope that with the huge number of people moving into the second and third phases of adulthood with these situations, this is a tipping point."" As Laurence points out, our whole economy is powered by debt. If a generation isn't able to buy mortgages on properties for them or their children, while wages stay stubbornly and unfairly low and the economy grows, it's a ""ticking time bomb"" situation. When will we leave our extended adolescence? Does dealing with all this mean we will have finally grown up by the time we're through the worst of it, if we ever even reach that stage? Dorsey predicts that we'll feel like we've reached adulthood when we're about 40—and I'm inclined to agree. But all we do know with certainty is that what ""adulthood"" means and how it is defined will completely change with our generation. Passing 18 could soon mean nothing—just an excuse for a party and the ability to buy a drink without fake ID. And many more traditional markers of adulthood could also be abandoned; ""being an adult"" might not mean owning a home or having a child any longer. Just as our parents set the parameters for our idea of what adulting was, we'll decide what being an adult means for Gen Z and beyond.","As Laurence points out, our whole economy is powered by debt.

365,"Narcissistic personality traits seem to have risen as quickly as obesity in recent years. Entitlement has become a defining characteristic of millennials, and everything from selfies to the everyone-gets-a-trophy mentality has been implicated in increased narcissism. Yet in and among all of the social commentary and scientific research about narcissism, one important question remains unanswered: What happens when a generation of narcissists becomes parents? Narcissism is a personality pattern characterized by a lack of empathy, increased levels of grandiosity and entitlement, and a chronic seeking of admiration and validation. In her book, Should I Stay or Should I Go? Surviving a Relationship with a Narcissist, Ramani Durvasula details 30 character traits of narcissism, but she says superficiality, greed and vanity make up its central core. ""It’s like all of the deadly sins rolled up into one person,"" Durvasula says. Everyone is a little bit narcissistic. Narcissism is part of being human, and it’s a standard developmental stage for adolescents and young adults. When narcissism begins to interfere with how a person functions at home and work, though, it becomes problematic and can even veer into the realm of a personality disorder. Narcissists genuinely believe they are unique and entitled to special treatment, and they have a chronic need for admiration and validation — at any cost. ""Most of us grow out of thinking we are Superman at 6 years old,"" says Durvasula. ""We shouldn’t be running around like that at 41."" Children don’t offer the type of continuous positive feedback narcissists crave, and narcissistic parents tend to react in one of two ways. Durvasula and W. Keith Campbell, a professor of psychology at University of Georgia and an expert on narcissism, say some lose interest in their children entirely and look for other sources of validation. Others view their children as a reflection of themselves and become hyper-involved and controlling. In both cases, disconnection is the key; even the overly involved narcissistic parent is emotionally detached and lacks warmth. The impact of being raised by a narcissist isn’t well documented on an individual level, and it’s been even less studied on a societal scale. Campbell has written more than 100 scientific articles and three books about the narcissism epidemic, but he admits parenting is a gaping hole in our understanding of narcissism. ""We very rarely study the parents’ narcissism and then predict what will happen to the kids,"" says Campbell. This lack of formal research doesn’t mean experts such as Campbell don’t have theories, however. ""One thing you would see with narcissistic parents is using their kids as a route to self-advancement,"" he says. ""As a narcissistic parent, you look good and feel good because of the success of your kid. The same way that a narcissist can have a trophy spouse, you can have a trophy kid."" Narcissistic parents have high expectations of their children — and plenty of them. They push their kids to excel in sports, do well in school, attend elite universities, and work in high-status careers. Narcissistic parents believe their children are special and deserving of special opportunities and privileges, and they refuse to tolerate anything less than perfection. They view their children as a part of themselves — ""like their arm or their leg,"" Durvasula says — and when their children aren’t achieving, they withdraw their affection and become disconnected. Children aren’t equipped to handle that disconnection from their primary caregivers. They need parents who are consistent, available and unconditionally approving to form secure attachments. As adults, we rely on these secure attachments formed in childhood to dictate how we relate to others, view ourselves, and even cope with stress. When the formation of that secure attachment is disrupted, the impacts can last a lifetime. Jennifer Doig knows the pain of having a narcissistic parent. Her mother was a classic narcissist, alternately abandoning her and expecting her to hold the household together. Now an adult with children of her own, Doig still struggles to carve a path separate from her mother’s expectations. ""I feel like I’ve worn a mask my entire life"" she says. ""I need to be who I am and I don’t even know who that is. That’s a hard place to be when you’re 41 years old."" Sara Shaugh was also raised by a narcissist. She says her mother focused on her appearance and weight intensely, and groomed her from early childhood to marry a rich man. When Shaugh was in the hospital with a brain injury and a broken neck and back after being hit by a car, her mother’s top priority was Shaugh’s appearance. ""One of the first things she did was call my hairdresser because my hair was a mess,"" Shaugh recalls. ""This was before they even knew if I was going to live or die. But what was really sick about the whole thing was the whole time I was thinking, ‘Maybe now my mother will love me because she almost lost me.’ "" These stories aren’t unique. ""Narcissistic parents beget kids with a whole host of psychological problems,"" Durvasula says. These problems include higher than average rates of depression and anxiety, lack of self-regulation, eating disorders, low self-esteem, an impaired sense of self, substance abuse and perfectionism. And we don’t exist in a vacuum. The narcissism of other parents creeps into how the rest of us raise our children. Narcissists’ relentless focus on their children’s accomplishments creates competition among children and between parents. Even the ""mommy wars"" have their root in narcissistic parenting, Campbell says. Most people who get caught up in competitive parenting aren’t narcissists. Durvasula points out that we live in a competitive culture where success is measured by good grades, elite colleges, wealth and status rather than someone’s levels of empathy and compassion. ""We have created a world where it’s almost impossible to get ahead unless you’re a narcissist,"" Durvasula says. Even parents with the best intentions get pulled into this cycle. Most parents who lobby to get their children into elite schools, hire college application coaches or push kids to get straight A’s sincerely want to help them advance in a society with limited options and a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots. But this focus can instill narcissistic traits in children unless parents balance competition with empathy and compassion. Another danger is how the focus on materialism and status shifts the parenting barometer for everyone. When narcissistic parents buy their tweens expensive smartphones and throw their teenagers elaborate sweet 16 parties, their overblown displays of affection become desirable to other kids. Parents don’t want to disappoint their kids, so they give in and buy their children the same things. Pretty soon, it becomes abnormal for tweens not to have smartphones, and narcissistic parents have to find even more elaborate ways to show their affection. Millennials aren’t to blame for the growth in narcissism (despite all of the flack they get). It has its roots in the dawn of the individualism movement in the 1800s, but technology has taken hold of that growing trend toward individualism and made it a way of life. Now, consumers expect an online shopping experience tailored to their preferences and television customized to their viewing habits. Every aspect of the online world is centered around the individual, and growing numbers of Americans spend the bulk of their waking hours online. ""Even in places like Starbucks without computers, there are 30,000 ways to have your coffee,"" Campbell says. ""It makes us feel like individuals, and we feel special."" This belief in being special is at the root of narcissism, and it’s where healthy self-esteem and narcissism diverge. When researchers at Princeton University studied the roots of narcissism in children, they found that it was predicted by parental overvaluation of their children. Children became narcissistic, at least in part, by internalizing their parents’ inflated ideas of them — and narcissistic parents are notorious for doing exactly that. There’s no simple formula for predicting who will become a narcissist, or how a child will react to being raised by one. Upbringing matters, but genetics and a child’s personality traits factor in. Fewer than half of the children of narcissists in Durvasula’s practice became narcissists, but there’s no large data pool of adult children of narcissists to study — for now. Durvasula expects this generation to give psychologists plenty of research fodder. ""One thing I can guarantee you is [children of narcissists] will be plagued by doubt and insecurity the rest of their lives,"" she says. ""The question is how that is going to manifest.""","[children of narcissists] will be plagued by doubt and insecurity the rest of their lives,"" she says.

It’s the oldest method of staying caffeinated in the world, and while you don’t often see it at your local coffee shop (unless your local coffee shop doubles as a Middle Eastern restaurant), ong before cortados, cold brew, and flat whites began appearing on cafe menus, the Turkish were brewingkahveby grinding and boiling coffee beans. It’s the oldest method of staying caffeinated in the world, and while you don’t often see it at your local coffee shop (unless your local coffee shop doubles as a Middle Eastern restaurant), Turgay Yildizli is trying to change that. The 2013 World Cezve Ibrik champion has turned his passion for quality beans into a side gig that has him teaching coffee connoisseurs from places as far flung as Thailand how to make a proper cup of Turkish coffee . He talked to Extra Crispy about the ancient brewing method and why any serious coffee lover should give it a shot. Extra Crispy: What does it mean to be a World Cezve Ibrik champion? Turgay Yildizli: It’s like a bartender competition, but the idea is to promote and educate baristas, and the specialty grade, high-quality coffee. They prefer to call it cezve ibrik because the well-known name is It’s like a bartender competition, but the idea is to promote and educate baristas, and the specialty grade, high-quality coffee. They prefer to call itcezve ibrikbecause the well-known name is Turkish coffee , but in Greece they call it Greek coffee, in Russia sometimes they call it cezve, and sometimes in the Middle East they call it ibrik or Arabic, Turkish coffee. In Yugoslavia they call it Bosnian coffee. It has different names. But it’s all the same coffee? Same method. Probably around the 16th century the Ottomans learned from Yemen Arabs how to brew the coffee, and then it became popular in Istanbul palaces. Then European travelers learned from the Turks how to make Turkish coffee. First, [the Turkish would] boil the water, and then they would add the powder. They would use mortar and pestle, and then drink all day long because, you know, there's no alcohol. It's forbidden for Muslims, so [coffee] was very popular in the region. What are the main components of making Turkish coffee today? The basic brewing method, and the oldest, most primitive, is you need coffee and water and equipment. A cezve is a Turkish coffee pot. It's a specially designed pot with a long handle. You need coffee, water, this coffee pot, and a heat source—this can be gas, electrical, charcoal. So you boil the coffee with the water, and you can add any ingredients. Now, mostly everybody adds sugar in Turkey, but in the Middle East they add some spices like cinnamon and cardamom. In this region, generally, they use very low-quality commercial grade coffee. That coffee has some defects and bad taste and no natural flavors. Also, [improper] brewing methods create over extraction and bitterness, so [people in Turkey] add extra sugar to balance that bitterness. But when you use high quality, well developed, well-roasted coffee, you don’t need to add sugar or other ingredients. Coffee has already a very natural sweetness, if well-roasted, and characteristic natural flavors. What are the biggest misconceptions about Turkish coffee? I know many people think that it’s very bitter, but you’re saying that can be avoided by using high-quality beans? There are two problems with Turkish coffee: coffee and water quality, and improper brewing methods. Everybody learns this method from their parents, from grandfather, grandmother and then they boil the coffee three times so that it creates over extraction and bitterness. They don’t use fresh coffee, they use pre-ground coffee, stale coffee, and everybody expects nice, thick foam, so to create extra foam they boil three times. There's a lot of scientific research for filtered coffee or espresso coffee, but not a lot of research about Turkish coffee. Also there are standards for filtered coffee. So I tried to apply that information to this matter. It's difficult to use all that information because the biggest difference between Turkish coffee and other methods is filtration. We don't filter the coffee. We brew and pour into the cup, so extraction is continuing, and the taste is changing. I try to prevent that over-extraction with coffee selection, coffee roasting, equipment, and brewing technique. All the variables are very important for brewing pleasant coffee. Can you describe the ritual of drinking Turkish coffee? The ritual way is serving it with water and something sweet. It is a very old tradition. Three or four hundred years ago, before the discovery of sugar, they were using dried fruit. Now we have Turkish delight, which we call lokum , which became a very popular sweet. But the idea is water to clean your palate, drink coffee to get the flavors, then you eat something sweet to balance. As you travel to teach people about Turkish coffee, what are their reactions? Two and a half years ago, no one knew specialty coffee. Even my friends in Turkey laughed at me saying, ""What is specialty coffee? That is impossible!"" OK. It's possible because when I share the coffee with coffee professionals, especially from the U.S., they're shocked. They're surprised because they don't expect that kind of taste, because they probably have some bad experience, and nobody wants to play around with the Turkish coffee method. But in this region—in Turkey, in Greece—it's getting popular because of specialty coffee shops. I'm consulting with a company in Turkey so they can serve good quality coffee. I pick the green coffee beans for them, and I decide the roast profile. Also, I design equipment and workflow for their coffee shops and restaurants. Social media helps, and it's like the new item I think for coffee shop menus. Greek, Middle Eastern, North African, Balkan, Russian, or Ukrainian [people] have an interesting connection to this method from their family and daily life. It may not be the next thing, but it can be a new item for coffee shop menus. So why should someone start making Turkish coffee? Because of the ritual. I prefer this manual method because you have full control, and the difference is there's no filtration, so in the cup, the extraction is continuing. Also, the taste is changing. It's changing so after, for example, 20 minutes, you can feel the defects in the cup. It’s easier to feel the defects in the cup, so it affects your buying decisions. Also lately, I'm talking with coffee professionals. They say espresso is very dense, and the method sometimes brings out one characteristic of the coffee—maybe the acidity, or maybe the sweetness, but sometimes, it depends on the barista, and it depends on the coffee and the machine. You can get very balanced coffee [with Turkish coffee]. Coffee should have a good aroma, a good flavor, a good sweetness and a nice body or texture, and overall, you need to describe the aromatics, flavors, acidity, sweetness, but at the same time, it should be balanced and pleasing in the cup. With Turkish coffee, the only difficult part is that when you brew the coffee it creates foam. The first sip holds coffee grounds, so that's what you taste. But after the second sip, it gets clear, smooth, and sweet. What’s the ideal bean for Turkish coffee? In [Turkey], they love Brazilian coffee. Commercial grade coffee is popular because of the price. That coffee has a very round, big, strong body and almost no acidity and sweetness. For that bitterness, people add sugar, to add sweetness to their coffee. But still, when you introduce a new coffee bean, everyone expects they can accept the acidity, but they are still looking for the texture. That big body texture is very important. For example, I'm used to bad Turkish coffee, but also I try very high-quality, expensive coffees. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When I introduce the specialty Turkish coffee to a new or regular Turkish coffee drinker, I like to serve two coffees: coffee from Sulawesi and natural process Ethiopian coffee. There’s some sweetness, some extra body, but still some wonderful fruity notes. If you have to go to a Starbucks , what’s your order? [ Laughs ] I order tea. I always carry my equipment with me, so there’s no reason to go to Starbucks.","It may not be the next thing, but it can be a new item for coffee shop menus"
370,"Verda Byrd spent the past seven decades of her life as a black woman, but at age 70, she discovered a shocking family secret her parents took to their grave that she's recently made peace with -- she was born white. Byrd, now 72, was adopted as a baby in 1943 by her black parents, who never told her that her biological parents were actually white, she said, explaining that she only uncovered the truth in 2013 about her birth after she went on a search for her biological parents' history. ""It was overwhelming,"" she told ABC News today. ""You cannot erase 70 years of your life and just accept what the papers say instantly. It's like 70 years pass by, and in a blink of an eye, you’re a different race."" And though her story may sound similar to that of Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader whose parents accused her of pretending to be black, Byrd said she wants to make it clear she and Dolezal actually very different. ""She upsets me so much because I don’t understand why she or anyone needs to lie about their race or their ethnic group,"" said Byrd, of Converse, Texas. ""I did not know I was born white. She knew it."" Byrd's story is a complicated one, and it starts in Kansas City, Missouri, on Sept. 27, 1942, when she was born Jeanette Beagle to her white parents, Daisy Beagle and Earl Beagle, she learned from her adoption documents. KENS ""Daisy and Earl were legally married, but Earl would go away and come back and go away in come back,"" she said. ""In 1943, during a time he left Daisy, she had an accident. She fell 30 feet from a Kansas City trolley and wasn't able to care for her then five children. She was in the hospital for a year, and all of her children were placed in a children's home."" Though Daisy Beagle eventually took four of her children back, she left behind Byrd, who was the youngest and still a baby, and Byrd said she suspects it was because her birth mother realized she wouldn't be able to take care of her. Byrd was legally adopted by a black couple, Ray Wagner and Edwinna Wagner, who couldn't have children of their own, Byrd said, adding that her name was changed to ""Verda Ann Wagner."" She later married and changed her last name to Byrd. Strangers would assume Byrd took after her light-skinned mother, Byrd said, and because she had curly hair that could be styled similarly to black women's hair, no one in Newton, Kansas, where she grew up, questioned her about her race, she said. ""I went to a white school because our town was small and our schools weren't segregated,"" she said. ""And other than my dad getting paid less than his white counterparts, my family didn't experience much discrimination because my mom and I were lighter-skinned and there weren't a lot of African Americans in Newton."" The dynamics in Newton however, were much different than that of nearby segregated metropolis Topeka, where Byrd and her family sometimes attended church, she said. ""I was friends with Linda Brown, who was the daughter of the pastor of the AME church I went to youth group conferences with,"" Byrd said. Brown was involved in the landmark Supreme Court case Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which ruled school segregation unconstitutional. Byrd said she ""lived the black experience"" even more so at 21 when she moved to a black community where her aunt and uncle lived in St. Paul, Minnesota, to start work. ""I then began to have black boyfriends, go to black churches and go to black social clubs,"" she said. ""In church classes, I studied the [civil rights] marches and studied our black history, that kind of stuff. I knew who Martin Luther King was and what he stood for. I knew about Emmett Till, Malcolm X, the KKK, that kind of stuff. This was the era I lived and grew up in."" Byrd eventually married a black man, who served in the Air Force, and she traveled often with him depending on where he was deployed, she said, adding that they've now been married for over 36 years and have one daughter together. ""Even when my mom died 30 years ago and I first discovered the adoption document with my birth name, we were traveling to Paris, Tokyo, Germany, all these places, so I didn't really think about my birth or adoption or race,"" she said. KENS Byrd came across the documents again in 2013, after the couple retired in Converse, Texas, a suburb outside of San Antonio. ""At that time, I thought, now I have the peace of mind to find out who this Jeanette Beagle really is,"" Byrd said, explaining that she hired a researcher to help her trace her biological history and adoption records. ""I had to read them over and over and over again for two to three days,"" she said, explaining that the experience was overwhelming and that she found out she actually had 10 biological siblings, only four of whom are still alive. But today, two years after the revelation, she's come to terms with her experience and identity, Byrd said, adding she recently reunited with some of her biological siblings. ""I've accepted my life, because as a trans-racial adoptee, it is what it is,"" she said. ""I am still comfortable as Verda Ann Wagner Byrd. When I die, and when I'm six feet under, my tombstone is not going to have the word 'race' on it. I'm lucky to have two moms and dads."" As for what race she currently identifies as, Byrd said she believes she is ""a beautiful black woman"" and that she recently checked white, black and other on paperwork at a military hospital facility in San Antonio. ""If they need clarification, I can give it to them,"" she said. ""I was born white, but my whole life, I've lived the black experience.""",her biological parents were actually white
371,"Burn your pajamas and throw away the oversized t-shirts. We all need a little bit more nudity in our lives, especially when it comes to sleeping. DNews neatly wraps up all the latest science on the benefits of sleeping au naturale in this recent short video. The logic behind it is fairly simple – we sleep better at slightly lower body temperatures, and the less clothing, the less heat. A very slight increase in temperature can increase activity in areas of the brain that regulate sleep cycles, resulting in a more disturbed sleep. Studies have shown that a decrease even as tiny as 0.4°C (1.1°F) can make all the difference. For guys, that temperature drop can help increase your sperm count, since sperm is best produced at temperatures just below our core body temperature. For women, being free from restrictive clothing can allow your private bits to air and cool, which is important since harmful bacteria can easily thrive in warm and moist areas. Sleeping naked with a partner also has its biochemical benefits. Skin-to-skin contact is proven to increase the release of oxytocin, the so-called ""love hormone"", which can boost your mood, help maintain your immune system, and even spark feelings of emotional intimacy. Just in case you needed any more excuses to sleep in your birthday suit, check out the video below.","we sleep better at slightly lower body temperatures, and the less clothing, the less heat."
372,"A new sort of ""retro"" visual style has crept into indie development. The flat 8-bit pixel art revival has been with us for some time now. It's sometimes employed for a self-consciously nostalgic feel, harking back to the touchstones of the developer's childhood in the 1980s. Sometimes, it's used to convey ironic detachment. But most developers employ the style because they simply love the stark simplicity of the constraints it imposes But lately, there has been a rise in a low-poly aesthetic, similar to that of early PS1, Sega Saturn, and N64 game graphics. This emerging trend--evident in games like Back in 1995, MacBat 64, Racing Apex, morphê, and Else Heart.Break()--may simply be a younger cohort of indie developers who want to celebrate or emulate the titles that made them fall in love with games. But like pixel art before it, it's not as simple as wanting to recapture childhood. The deliberate choice of a minimalist low-poly art style is a movement toward making the player use their imagination. It's a way of creating a visual style that simplifies and clarifies aspects of the game. It's yet another tool that lets developers keep a clear vision of what their game should be. We spoke to five developers who are employing this visual style to learn more about the why, what and how of it. NOSTALGIA IS PART OF IT While the low-poly style does have many different utilities for developers, many admit to feeling a little thrill at creating games that look like the ones they used to cherish. ""My goal with the game is to make it as much of a time capsule as possible,"" says Marcus Horn , developer of MacBat 64 , an N64/Banjo-Kazooie styled-platformer. ""I want people to play the game and feel like they are actually back in the 90s and relive some of their childhood memories. I also want to introduce new and younger people to what games felt like back in those days."" MacBat 64 by Siactro's Workshop MacBat 64 by Siactro's Workshop Many players can likely remember the first time they felt that gaming be a big part of their lives. That first spark that drew players to games is often an important memory, and aspects that touch on that, such as a similar art style, can draw out that feeling from them again, creating a pleasant nostalgia. ""This is the style I grew up with in my teens and I'm really fond of it."" says Takaaki Ichijo , developer of Back in 1995 , a mystery game heavily-inspired by the original 1990s Silent Hill's look, play style, and story. Not only does this look back give a sense of nostalgia to these developers, but it is also an important means of conveying the history of the medium. Racing Apex by Lucky Mountain Games Racing Apex by Lucky Mountain Games Racing Apex is our tribute to some of the first 3D polygonal racing games such as Winning Run, Hard Drivin' and Virtua Racing,"" says Trevor Ley . ""So, we wanted to be faithful to how those games were made. These were arcade machines that showed the world what was possible in 3D as racing games moved on from scaling sprites."" It must also be said that at this point in time, when a new 8-bit sidescroller seems to hit the app store every other day, the low-poly look is a retro style that feels simultaneously familiar and fresh. Back in 1995 Back in 1995 ""In April 2015, before I announced Back in 1995, there weren't any other indie creators using this 32 bit console style,"" says Ichijo. ""So I decided to give it a try. The game which influenced me most was the original Silent Hill [1999]. The creatures generated a very pronounced sense of fear, much of which was due to them being created with a low polygon count."" It was also a means to make his game stand out from other works. ACTIVATING IMAGINATION A mid-1990s visual style also harks back to a time when players were required to smooth out the blocky textures wrapped around the spiky character models in their heads. ""For me, a very important part about games was always that they left some room for your own imagination,"" says Horn. ""If a game tells and shows you every little detail, it's just not memorable enough. It becomes somewhat boring over time."" A game's visual style needs to convey many things. It needs to tell you what the world and its characters look like, but also hints at how the player interacts with this place. It needs to clarify what you are doing and what you are looking at. Since gaming's inception, players have needed to fill in some of the gaps. A character made up of a few dozen polygons tasks the player in this way, though not as much as a character made up of a few dozen pixels. ""I am not saying that every game needs to look like an Atari 2600 game,"" says Horn, ""but if there is just a tiny bit left for the player's imagination, it can add so much to the experience. For me personally, the low poly 3D aesthetics of the N64 and PSOne era are the last one to really achieve this feeling."" MacBat 64 MacBat 64 The low-poly style can be seen as 3D gaming's equivalent to minimalism. It creates a visual framework where the artist, through carefully-crafted simplicity, draws out the creativity of the work's receiver. The player must do some work to fully realize what they are looking at, and in doing so, create a connection to the work that is all their own. DRAWING PLAYER FOCUS Pat Flannery & Micky Hulse, developers at Pixelfoot Games and the creators of morphê, agree wholeheartedly.""Low-poly 3D is one of the few places in which 3D design intersects minimalism,"" they say. ""Solid slabs of color on a 3D model are, to the eye, almost indistinguishable from flat vector graphics. For morphê , we wanted the visuals to parallel the game’s ambient music — which is audibly calming and peaceful, and the low-poly 3D is a similarly visually relaxing experience."" morphê by Pixelfoot Games morphê by Pixelfoot Games In morphê, players create their own music in an interactive environment. The developers wanted to focus attention on the music, and they found that this visual style aided that. ""Low-poly didn’t prove to be a hindrance in any way, because the focus is more on the music than the visuals,"" says the developers. ""Clean visuals help users focus on the sound and the overall experience."" CREATING CLARITY Low-poly visuals with flat textures can also create environments with little visual noise. With other styles, there can be a need to add detail, whereas many see the low-poly style as a means to create clarity through simplicity. With Racing Apex, Ley found this style let him shave away extraneous detail, crafting an experience that was immediately clear with a glance. ""This visual style is great for racing games as it provides crisp, clean definition to the race tracks and vehicles and it looks great at sixty frames per second!"" he says. Racing Apex Racing Apex ""As all 3D meshes are vertex colored and no textures are used, the challenge is creating detail without textures and the minimum amount of polys,"" adds Ley. ""This involves reducing environments, vehicles and characters down to only the key aspects of shape and color. In some ways, it's quite therapeutic to remove all the extraneous details to be left with a still-recognizable form."" THE CHALLENGES OF 'NEO RETRO' Crafting a game with low-poly visuals is not without its challenges, as many developers find when they create their worlds. ""As an artist, being forced to create characters and scenes within these limitations is a huge challenge."" says Ichijo. Back in 1995 Back in 1995 It can also be difficult to maintain just the right balance in what you wish to convey. ""Minimalism does create fairly constricting limitations. Too much detail can make a work noisy--no longer minimal--while too little detail makes the work seem unfinished, lazy, and uninteresting,"" say Hulse and Flannery. ""Keeping within strict parameters, however, is probably one of the most important disciplines a digital artist must employ."" With low-poly, developers may feel the need to add more details to create a clearer picture, or find themselves taking too many away to keep to the art style. These can create varied problems, as the developers at Pixelfoot Games point out, as it makes it difficult to be sure you've added enough details to convey what you want to, but not so many that it defeats the simplicity of the style. Creating detail in just the right manner for a low-poly game is a challenge, as it requires a very specific amount of detail to achieve the historical look many developers wanted, and for those who sought out the simplicity and clarity of the style, it was still difficult to get the look down just right. Its limitations can help make things clearer for a developer, but that doesn't mean it's easy to use this style to communicate everything your game needs to say. HONING DEVELOPMENT Still, the low-poly aesthetic is mainly about devs discovering how freeing self-imposed constraints can be. That's certainly the case with Niklas Åkerblad , artist for Else Heart.Break() , an adventure game where puzzles can be solved through programming skills. The game employs more detailed textures than you'd find in 1995, but the shapes and models are simple and squared-off. ""Just because we use low poly models does not mean we have created limitations,"" says Åkerblad. ""It just means we have created an algorithm for us to use when getting to know what rules govern the metaphysical laws of our gameworld."" Else Heart.Break() Else Heart.Break() The low-poly style helped many developers create a clear vision of how they wanted their game to work. For some, that came from holding onto the gameplay limitations that came during the time period these visuals first appeared. ""It gives the game a certain limitation and that is very important, in my opinion,"" says Horn. ""The low-poly art-style kind of acts like a canvas for me that I can start to draw on. I know how the characters will have to look, how the worlds will behave, how animations should look like and so on. In my opinion it really helps me, as a developer, a lot to when I can work with limitations like this and use them in a way to create something that ultimately looks so much better than what I would have done without limitations."" This also came about, not from creating something that felt like it would fit in a certain time period, but in creating matching visuals and play. The nostalgic stylistic elements of Back in 1995 extend beyond the visuals. ""I also adjusted my thinking regarding the game's systems to match the time period: I used tank controls, added fake loading screens and had the player's life bar on the menu screen"" says Ichijo. ""These are all gameplay experiences dictated by the art style."" ""It is a matter of harmony between all the aspects,"" says Åkerblad. ""People generally talk about the different aspects of making games, but I think it's more interesting to point out the perfect harmony you can achieve instead. Games aren't composed of art, design and code. Games are concocted out of harmonization between those aspects."" Else Heart.Break() Else Heart.Break() The low-poly art style suited the mysterious, programmable world that the developers were trying to create in Else Heart.Break(). The style fit with the ""hi-tech"" feeling the game needed to give off to feel cohesive, and so the art style fed off of what the game was trying to do during its creation. One would not exist without the other, creating a balance in development. LOW-POLY FUTURE It's exciting to think about where developers will take this new/old aesthetic in the future. It's also exciting to think about how audiences who were too young to experience the pioneering mid-1990s 3D titles will absorb this aesthetic. ""It is interesting to see people encountering, and enjoying this particular art style for the very first time,"" says Horn. ""After a while, it seems that the novelty vanishes and the immersion and imagination kicks in, just like it did so many years ago.""",The deliberate choice of a minimalist low-poly art style is a movement toward making the player use their imagination.
373,"Renaissance physician Paracelsus famously said, ""The dose makes the poison,"" meaning that even harmless substances can become toxic if you eat enough of them. Many people ask me, ""Is high fructose syrup really that bad for you?"" And my answer to this question is ""Yes,"" mainly for this very reason. In America today, we are eating huge doses of sugar, especially high fructose corn syrup. It is sweeter and cheaper than regular sugar and is in every processed food and sugar-sweetened drink. Purging it from your diet is the single best thing you can do for your health! In recent history, we've gone from 20 teaspoons of sugar per person per year to about 150 pounds of sugar per person per year. That's a half pound a day for every man, woman, and child in America. The average 20-ounce soda contains 15 teaspoons of sugar, all of it high fructose corn syrup. And when you eat sugar in those doses, it becomes a toxin. As part of the chemical process used to make high fructose corn syrup, the glucose and fructose -- which are naturally bound together -- become separated. This allows the fructose to mainline directly into your liver, which turns on a factory of fat production in your liver called lipogenesis. This leads to fatty liver, the most common disease in America today, affecting 90 million Americans. This, in turn, leads to diabesity -- pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. So, high fructose corn syrup is the real driver of the current epidemic of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, dementia, and of course, Type 2 diabetes. HFCS contains dangerous chemicals and contaminants Beside the ginormous load of pure fructose and sugar found in HCFS, as an added bonus, it contains other chemical toxins. Chemical contaminants used during manufacturing end up in the HFCS and in our food. What we know, for example, is that chloralkali is used in making high fructose corn syrup. Chloralkai contains mercury. And there are trace amounts of mercury found in high fructose corn syrup-containing beverages. Now, it may not be a problem if we eat this occasionally, but the average person in the country consumes more than 20 teaspoons a day of high fructose corn syrup and the average teenager has 34 teaspoons a day. Over time, these heavy metals can accumulate in the body, causing health problems. Additionally, when we look at the chemical components of high fructose corn syrup on a spectrograph, we can see that it contains many weird chemicals that we know nothing about. That's why I say better safe than sorry. Look out for the red flag The main reason you should give up high fructose corn syrup is that it's a big red flag for very poor quality food. If you see this ingredient on a label, I guarantee you the food is processed junk. So, if high fructose corn syrup is anywhere on the label, put it back on the shelf. You should never eat this food. If you want to stay healthy, lose weight easily, get rid of chronic disease, and help reduce the obesity epidemic, the single most important thing you can do is eliminate high fructose corn syrup from your diet and from your children's diet. Just banish it from your house. Purge your kitchen I challenge you to go into your kitchen right now, go in the cupboard and refrigerator, and look at every single label. And I want you to count how many products you have right now in your house that contain high fructose corn syrup. Then, I want you to get a big garbage bag and throw them out and find replacements that are free of it. If you want to have some sugar, that's fine. Have a little sugar, but add it to your food yourself. Don't eat food made with added sugar. Cut the high fructose corn syrup from your life forever. You'll be healthier. Our planet will be healthier. And we'll have a healthier generation of children. Wishing you health and happiness,","driver of the current epidemic of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, dementia, and of course, Type 2 diabetes."

Trump."" The basis for Trump’s impeachment, according to local ABC News affiliate KGO, would be the president’s alleged links to his private business holdings. Critics have claimed that these create conflicts of interest, and possibly violate the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause. However, there is no evidence that Trump has benefited from conflicts of interest, or that he has done anything illegal to justify the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" standard for impeachment. The Emoluments Clause argument is also thought by many constitutional scholars and legal analysts to be very weak. Donald Trump has been something of an obsession for Richmond politicians. In 2015, the mayor blamed Trump for inciting a hate crime against a local mosque, even though the suspect had praised Hillary Clinton in social media. Richmond is the sixth-poorest large city in the state, and has the highest public employee salary burden, according to a nonpartisan report issued last year. The report documented exorbitant salaries paid to local officials, such as $560,000 in total salary and benefits to the local fire chief.","The basis for Trump’s impeachment, according to local ABC News affiliate KGO, would be the president’s alleged links to his private business holdings"

The polar vortex is a mass of winds that form over the Arctic each winter, and tend to move in a circular motion around the region, according to NASA. This year, however, a few factors caused the vortex to dip south, like the jet stream moving further south than usual and a low-pressure system forming over Canada, according to the video. As this animation progresses from early December 2013 to early January 2014, you can watch the polar vortex -- represented by the purple colors -- bend southward over time. It features data collected by NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder Mission instrument, and shows temperatures at 3,000 feet above the Earth's surface.

382,"An argument over the recent election ended with one Donora, Pennsylvania, supporter of Hillary Clinton charged with assault after hitting a 69-year-old woman over the head with a chair, according to police. Matthew Pugh, 27, was arrested on November 30 on charges of attempted homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault, and reckless endangerment, after allegedly attacking the elderly woman in the lobby of a high rise, according to the Observer-Reporter. Police say that Clinton supporter Pugh and the woman were discussing the recent election in the lobby of the building back on November 20 when the woman either spoke against Hillary or made a favorable comment about Trump, sending the younger man into a rage. He allegedly picked up a chair and hit the old woman in the head, opening a gash in her forehead. Pugh was said to have knocked the woman to the floor, and she suffered additional injuries in the fall. Officials report that both the elderly woman and her attacker were taken to Monongahela Valley Hospital for treatment of injuries suffered in the fight.

So the next time you're left wondering whether someone you know is secretly a terrible person, ask them what they think about someone else. According to a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, this will actually reveal something about their own personality because people tend to see their own traits in other people. So a kind person will probably see others as kind too, and a selfish person will see others as selfish.

The simple tendency to see people negatively indicates a greater likelihood of depression and various personality disorders. As part of the study, participants were asked to judge the characteristics of three others, both positively and negatively.

On the other hand, the participants who judged others negatively tended to be narcissistic, with higher levels of anti-social behaviour. The study explained:  ...

Is it about safety, or is it just an elaborate way to intoxicate passengers, keeping them pliant while their stricken plane plummets to Earth? That, in case you’re scratching your head, is the verdict of Brad Pitt’s character Tyler Durden in the film Fight Club: ""You know why they put oxygen masks on planes? Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, you're taking giant panicked breaths. Suddenly you become euphoric, docile. You accept your fate. It's all right here [points at an emergency instruction manual on a plane]. Emergency water landing – 600 miles an hour. Blank faces, calm as Hindu cows."" Conspiracy theorists, we’re sorry. Oxygen masks really are there for your safety. More specifically, as the flight attendant’s briefing explains, it’s all about cabin pressure.  The air at high altitudes is thin, and oxygen levels very low, so aircraft have clever systems in place to keep cabin pressure at a level equivalent to an altitude of around 5,000-8,000 feet. Sitting on a plane, in a way, is like visiting Mexico City or Bogotá. A loss of pressure, therefore, is a significant issue – and potentially dangerous. If it happens suddenly – because of a bomb, for example – the resultant forces may damage or destroy the plane. Luckily, the vast majority of decompressions are not explosive – and are easy for the crew to handle. ""Crashes or fatalities from pressure problems are extremely uncommon, even with a fairly rapid decompression brought on by a hole or puncture,"" explains Patrick Smith, a pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential. ""If cabin pressure falls below a certain threshold, the masks will deploy from the ceiling, exposing everybody to the so-called ‘rubber jungle’. Should you be confronted by this spectacle, strap your mask on and try to relax. The plane will be at a safe altitude shortly, and there are several minutes of backup oxygen for everybody."" Several minutes? That might be less than you’d expect. So presumably the descent to a safe altitude is done pretty hastily. ""Up front, the pilots will don their own masks and commence a rapid descent to an altitude no higher than 10,000 feet,"" he continues. ""If the emergency descent feels perilously fast, this isn’t because the plane is crashing: it’s because the crew is doing what’s it’s supposed to do."" Smith speaks from experience. Recalling a flight from South America to the US, he says: ""All was quiet high over the Caribbean, when suddenly there was a loud whooshing sound that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. I could feel my ears popping and sure enough, a glance at the instruments showed we were quickly losing pressurisation. ""The captain and I put our masks on, took out the book, and began to troubleshoot. Part of that troubleshooting involved one of those steep descents. Commencing such a drop is a multistep process: set 10,000 in the altitude window; select ‘flight level change’ from the autoflight panel; increase the speed command to a point slightly below maximum; deploy the speedbrakes; retard the thrust levels to idle... To the passengers, I’m sure it felt like a rollercoaster, but everything was carefully coordinated and the autopilot was engaged the whole time."" But what if you’re flying over the Himalayas and can’t descent to 10,000 feet? ""Pilots will follow predetermined depressurisation routes that allow for a more gradual descent, in stages,"" says Smith. ""Even over mountains, there is always the opportunity to reach a safe altitude before supplemental oxygen runs out."" In fact, Smith's estimate of ""several minutes"" may be too conservative. Other sources – and evidence from the, ahem, fatal crash of Helios Airways Flight 522 – suggest there is actually 12-15 minutes of oxygen at hand.  So, really, try to relax. And don’t forget that selfie. What if you decline to use the mask? If the cabin really has lost pressure, hypoxia (basically a lack of oxygen) will quickly take effect on the brain, with symptoms including nausea and headaches – but also euphoria.   Tracey Bryan outlined her experience of decompression, the ‘rubber jungle’, and a rapid descent, on the website Quora. ""I was extremely calm,"" she said. ""I even remember giggling, teasing other passengers for putting on the oxygen masks, and insisting that they weren’t required. In fact, due to the delay in putting on the mask I’d become hypoxic and wasn’t thinking clearly. Eventually, my friendly practically forced the mask onto my face and as the hypoxia faded I began to feel nervous.""  According to Airbus, if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of ""useful consciousness"" without supplemental oxygen. Once the euphoria is over, hypoxia renders one unconscious and can cause brain damage or death. So wear the mask. And what about Tyler Durden’s claim that oxygen makes you high? Alas, it doesn’t. Pilots and astronauts will readily debunk that myth.  Finally, we’ll offer a little detail on how the masks actually work. Firstly, what you’re supplied isn’t exactly oxygen – nor is it not compressed air in the scuba diving sense. Oxygen tanks are heavy and bulky so aircraft use a more complicated system. The panel above each seat actually contains a cocktail of chemicals that, when burned, release oxygen. They might include barium peroxide, a fine white powder used in fireworks, sodium chlorate, more commonly used as a weedkiller, and potassium chlorate, a staple of school science lab experiments (it reacts violently with sugar). Tug the mask, like you’re told in the demonstration, and the chemical process starts. Once it starts, it cannot be stopped until everything’s burned up (around 12-15 minutes, as stated above). Do not expect the bag to inflate. Passengers have reportedly suffered hypoxia after believing their mask was broken because the bag wasn’t inflating, prompting them to remove it. Hence the warning given during every safety briefing. ""Oxygen is supplied in a constant flow,"" explained a BA spokesman. ""The bag does not inflate like a respirator bag used in a medical theatre. How full it gets depends on an individual's rate of breathing. If the rate of breathing is very quick, air is inhaled at a faster rate and so the bag will inflate less. If all the air isn't inhaled, some will remain in the bag, partially inflating it."" The oxygen generator can also get extremely hot – so don’t touch it – and passengers may even notice a burning smell (so don’t be alarmed). Are all these burning chemicals dangerous? Sort of. The crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in 1996, in which all 110 on board perished, was caused by an oxygen generator fire. However, the devices to blame were in the cargo hold, out of date, and missing their safety caps. A jolt lit one, and the rest followed. Understandably, masks are not deployed if there is an on-board fire as the production of oxygen may make matters worse. And are they safe to inhale? ""You might get some small bits of chemical dust,"" Arch Carson, an occupational health expert, told The Huffington Post last year. ""But it’s way better than the alternative, which is passing out due to lack of oxygen."" Agreed.","Oxygen masks really are there for your safety. More specifically, as the flight attendant’s briefing explains, it’s all about cabin pressure"

416,"Donald Trump is almost certainly not going to be the Republican presidential nominee, and his candidacy puts the Republican Party in a quandary over its rules for which candidates to include in debates. Trump has repeatedly suggested he will run for president, but has never followed through until now, although it remains unclear if his name will actually be on the ballot next year in Iowa. The real estate mogul has so far only released a short memo detailing his finances, but said Tuesday he will complete the full financial disclosure required by the Federal Election Commission to be a presidential candidate ""right on time."" Such a filing has risks for Trump, as it could show him as less wealthy than he claims and force him to open up his finances to public scrutiny. Even if he is on the ballot, Trump has obvious disadvantages. He has never run for another office or held another government post, as nearly all modern presidents have.The Republican Party has at least a dozen candidates with stronger credentials than Trump. Embed Brash Trump Full of Zingers During Presidential Announcement 2:18 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog He is unlikely to win a single primary. And Trump, unlike other long-shots like surgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina, is likely to use his candidacy to take personal potshots at the other candidates, particularly Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, instead of discussing policy. Trump's interest in politics seems aimed at gaining attention, not addressing serious issues. He is perhaps the most prominent Republican to suggest continually that President Obama was not born in the United States. After the president publicly released his birth certificate in 2011, Trump remained unconvinced. He said he would give $5 million to a charity on the president's behalf if Obama released his college transcript and passport records, which Trump suggested would show Obama is not an American citizen. Trump though has already succeeded in some ways. Through repeatedly flirting with presidential runs in the past and now following through, the real estate mogul has become an influential person in national politics. He's frequently a keynote speaker at Republican events like the Conservative Political Action Conference. He's treated as a serious candidate, appearing on-stage at GOP events before or after people who could in truth be the Republican nominee, like Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. In part, this stems from the overuse of polls by those in political circles. At the height of his questioning of Obama's citizenship back in April 2011, Trump was leading the Republican primary field, well ahead of Mitt Romney, the eventual winner. The polls create the impression that Trump is a true contender for the presidency. In reality, polls are often simply a test of fame. Trump has an NBC tv show (""The Apprentice"") and a chain of hotels named after him. He is ahead of some other Republican candidates simply because he is better-known. In a one-on-one contest between Trump and Rubio, the former would be trounced, as Republican voters learned more about both men's records and policy stances. Usually, Trump's strength in polls doesn't really matter. But the Republican Party has elevated the power of polls in the 2016 cycle, using them to, in effect, winnow the large GOP field. The Republican National Committee last month gave permission to Fox News to limit its presidential debate to the top 10 candidates in national polls. (The network is holding an informal ""forum"" for those outside the top 10.) Currently, Trump is ahead Ohio Gov. John Kasich, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and ex-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum in many surveys. Santorum finished second in the 2012 primaries, Kasich runs America's seventh-largest state and Graham is one of the party's leading voices on national security policy. A debate process that includes Trump but excludes that trio seems flawed. It would seem to reward questioning the president's birthplace over working in challenging government posts. Donald Trump has little chance of being the Republican nominee. But his presence may limit the ability of more plausible candidates to run effectively.",Donald Trump has little chance of being the Republican nominee.

418,"White House Press secretary Sean Spicer angrily confronted a CNN reporter following a story reporting that the administration pressured the FBI to publicly ""knock down"" Trump-Russia stories in the media. The gaggle, which took place Friday morning, was described as a ""background briefing"" by the White House. It included the White House press pool and was expanded to include a CNN reporter as well as reporters from ABC, NBC, Fox Business and Fox News. CBS was in the pool. Spicer went on the record to confront CNN in front of their colleagues in the White House during the briefing that occurred in his office. CNN reporter Joe John (whose byline did not appear on contested story), was told by Spicer that their network was wrong to suggest that the White House put ""pressure"" on the FBI to publicly challenge the reports on Trump-Russia ties. Some of the details of Spicer’s comments about the story were included in the White House press pool, but a White House aide that was present in the room detailed the confrontation. ""I know it’s a CNN issue you guys have — but at least get it straight,"" an enraged Spicer said to John. The White House maintains that FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe approached White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to discuss the misleading story in The New York Times, that he described as ""bulls**t."" That meeting occurred on February 15, after the New York Times published the story. Priebus asked McCabe if they would correct the record, which cited sources claiming the existence of an FBI investigation into ""repeated contacts"" between Trump aides and Russian intelligence. The CNN report claims that this meeting violated ""procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations."" All of this was directly pointed out to CNN reporter Joe John during the press gaggle. Spicer repeatedly emphasized that the meeting was about a story in a newspaper, not the ongoing investigation. The real story, according to White House officials, was that according to the FBI, the New York Times got their initial story wrong. CNN’s reporter was told by Spicer that their network had ""buried the lead."" Spicer reportedly said he was ""disgusted"" with the way CNN handled the story, calling it ""disgraceful."" Later, Friday afternoon, the White House hosted a gaggle for the press pool in Sean Spicer’s office, and included reporters from One America News, Breitbart News, The Washington Times, and The Washington Examiner. CNN was not included in the second gaggle, which prompted a protest that they were being ""shut out"" by Spicer. ""This is an unacceptable development by the Trump White House. Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts that don’t like,"" a statement from the CNN public relations department read. ""We’ll keep reporting regardless."" Similar exclusions of press outlets took place under the Obama administration, which restricted some press meetings to liberal outlets as reported by The New York Times.","Sean Spicer angrily confronted a CNN reporter following a story reporting that the administration pressured the FBI to publicly ""knock down"" Trump-Russia stories in the media"
420,"Tim Culpan is a technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly. He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News. I hate to rain on your parade and all, but that $50 billion investment Masayoshi Son is supposedly pledging to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S.? It's not happening. When fabulous people meet, fabulous things are said. Donald Trump and Son told the world in New York on Tuesday that the Japanese billionaire will create jobs equivalent to three times those at Facebook Inc. (market cap: $339 billion). At $1 million per job, the cash-to-employment ratio sounds reasonable. But SoftBank Group Corp. doesn't have that kind of cash. It's to come via the previously announced $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, a huge virtual pile of money that will be 45 percent provided by the government of Saudi Arabia, with $25 billion coming from SoftBank. The rest is still being rounded up, but expect Foxconn Technology Group to pitch in. (Let me pause here to point out the irony of the president-elect cheering a wave of Saudi money into the U.S.) As for SoftBank, the company doesn't have the money for its own fund. A quick look at its balance sheet and you'll see that the Japanese telco-cum-VC has $26.4 billion in cash, $35.3 billion in short-term borrowings, $137 billion in long-term liabilities and a junk credit rating from both S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service. In fact, ""substantial credit risk, have speculative characteristics"" is the way Moody's describes the Ba1 rating that it gave SoftBank. The term ""speculative characteristics"" describes this Son-Trump pledge. For Son to pony up the money to meet his end of the SoftBank Vision Fund, he'd put the mothership's debt rating in jeopardy. SoftBank's credit rating Junk Maybe Son doesn't care how much he pledges to Trump's job-creation campaign, calculating that it's worth the risk if it helps Sprint Corp., which SoftBank owns, take over T-Mobile US Inc. Son hinted as much when he told reporters that he wanted to celebrate Trump's election because the president-elect would advocate for deregulation. To be clear, those billions aren't intended for M&A, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. That's meant to be venture-capital money. As with some other measures announced by the president-elect, such investments were already in the pipeline before he won, and anyway the last thing the U.S. needs is trickle-down venturenomics. That $50 billion figure, which I predict won't be deployed by SoftBank in U.S. startups in our lifetime, much less during a four-year Trump term, is double the amount of all VC funding made in 2009 and just shy of the value invested in 2014, according to the accounting firm EY. The fact that the figure grew to $72.3 billion last year reinforces the point I made in October that the U.S. doesn't need more cash to keep Silicon Valley humming along. Then there's job creation. In theory, $50 billion could create 50,000 jobs. However, this is not a new $50 billion, but additional money on top of the billions already available from U.S. venture capitalists and the buckets more flooding in from around the world, including China. The 50th $1 billion will create far fewer jobs than the first $1 billion. While neither Trump nor Son may worry too much about the facts, it's clear someone will be writing checks that can't be cashed. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Yes, I know that Son and Trump never said it would be invested during his presidency.","I hate to rain on your parade and all, but that $50 billion investment Masayoshi Son is supposedly pledging to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S.?

422,"While football fans were busy discussing Week 2 of the 2013 pro football season, PETA challenged the sports community by talking about what it suggests is a different NFL-sponsored pastime: animal testing in NFL-funded medical research. With the launch of a new campaign initiative, ""Unnecessary Roughness,"" PETA told supporters that the NFL's funding to research athletic injuries is no game for the laboratory animals involved. In a press release, PETA says the NFL has ""quietly funded horrific and deadly sports-injury experiments on dogs, mice, rats, and other animals at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California–Los Angeles, the University of Notre Dame, and other schools and private laboratories."" In February, PETA's Justin Goodman, director of the Laboratory Investigations Department, first contacted NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, citing numerous NFL-sponsored medical studies that PETA claimed used animal testing. Goodman told The Huffington Post that he was ""hoping to open up a dialogue privately"" about NFL funding. Studies cited in PETA's letter included a University of Gothenburg study, which repeatedly concussed mice to imitate brain injuries, as well as a Vanderbilt study that states laboratory dogs were given ""lesions to the knee"" to imitate sports injuries, and researchers subsequently ""sacrificed"" the dogs so scientists could study the results. The NFL never responded to PETA's February letter, Goodman said. PETA decided to renew its efforts in the wake of the NFL's late August lawsuit settlement against some 4,500 injured former and current NFL players. After the league agreed to a nearly $400 million settlement fee -- $10 million of which will specifically go to medical research -- PETA urged fans to tell the NFL not to fund more animal testing. The NFL responded to PETA's campaign Thursday, telling Bleacher Report that ""All grant requests have to be approved in advance by the institutional review board of the participating institution. In addition, we require any proposal to have been submitted for approvals by the institution’s animal care and use committee prior to applying for funds."" Indeed, the NFL has awarded grants to extremely prestigious medical researchers. One of these institutes, the UCLA Brain Research Institute, which received a grant in 2011, has become highly visible for its laboratory research on animals, both by proponents and opponents of the practice, according to the Los Angeles Times. In 2012, three UCLA researchers were even given an award by American Association for the Advancement of Science for continuing their animal research despite backlash. The head of the institute's Office of Animal Research Oversight was not available for comment at the time of publication. It seems what the science field celebrates as visionary, animal activists see as abuse. While the ethical quandary continues to play out, it remains to be seen whether the NFL will change its funding habits.","In a press release, PETA says the NFL has ""quietly funded horrific and deadly sports-injury experiments on dogs, mice, rats, and other animals at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of California–Los Angeles, the University of Notre Dame, and other schools and private laboratories."""

426,"Earlier this spring, San Francisco's parks department began a program allowing people to reserve corners of one of the city's most beloved public spaces, Dolores Park, for a fee. For $33, nonprofits and individual groups up to 50 people could claim part of the park for several hours. Larger corporate parties could do the same for $260. The permits, SFist wrote this week, didn't cover picnic tables or pavilions that are commonly reserved in city parks — but ""straight up sections of grass."" The very suggestion — public land parceled off for a price — set off the city's easily ignited outrage. More than 17,000 people signed a Change.org petition to end the reservations. One city supervisor (in the midst of an election fight) declared on Twitter that the city wasn't for sale — or for rent. Deadspin called the story the best quick encapsulation of ""how fast San Francisco has become a parceled-out playground for a class of moneyed, efficiency-fetishizing manchildren."" Within 24 hours this week, the parks department had suspended the permits. The episode, though, says as much about how we view public parks — and how easily they become platforms for anxieties about inequality — as it does any class warfare waged by park rangers. Parks elsewhere in San Francisco use this same system, without controversy. Cities throughout the country do, too. And they frequently charge administrative fees for those reservations. In New York City, you need a permit to gather more than 20 people in a city park, and it costs $25. A picnic in Chicago for up to 100 people will cost you $140 (plus an application fee and a security deposit). In a certain light, though, this standard practice suddenly looks more sinister. In San Francisco, a public good requiring a fee — and online application — looks like the latest lever newly arrived tech wealth might pull to displace everyone else. And, this time, from city lawn space, of all places. Online commenters worried about the slippery slope: Today it's a few ""straight up sections of grass,"" tomorrow it will be all of them. The program conjured deep-seated fears of the privatization of public space, the commodification of everything. And in a city where housing, restaurants and amenities have grown ever more expensive (the newly reopened SFMOMA costs an adult $25!), public parks are what people feel they have left. But idealized notions of the public park as an unregulated peoples' space are at odds with the reality of how they're run. Not just in San Francisco, but everywhere. ""Peoples' desire in a park is to do exactly what they want to do, wherever they want to do it, when they want to do it,"" says Adrian Benepe, a former head of the New York City parks department who now runs the Trust for Public Land's national urban park program. "" 'This is my park, I pay my taxes, and you’re supposed to be able to do whatever you want in a park.' "" That conviction, he says, has roots in the 1960s, in places like the Berkeley People's Park. And cities eager to reanimate abandoned public parks that had become dangerous in an era of urban decline encouraged people to come and use them however they pleased. ""So people got used to the idea that you could do whatever you wanted in a park,"" he says. ""If you wanted to play soccer, you could play soccer. If you wanted to have a barbecue, you could have a barbecue. Except nothing kills grass faster than soccer — except when someone spills a hibachi full of hot coals on the grass."" This do-whatever-you-want attitude can spoil a park, he says, for the same public it's supposed to serve. Parks are a scarce and fragile resource. And so cities began to do what most do today: They have rules for when you can be there, and what you can do, and how you should play nice with others. They set up the kind of permit systems San Francisco has to manage competing claims to scarce space. They have to balance the demands of people who want an off-leash dog park with the demands of people who don't want off-leash dogs running through their picnics. And this part the public should support: If you want to lay personal — if temporary — claim to public land, you have to compensate everyone else for it. You have to pay a deposit so public tax dollars aren't left to clean up after you. You have to pay an administrative fee so that we're not funding park staff to make sure you don't trash our shared space. The fact that San Francisco charges corporate parties significantly more than private citizens and nonprofits is in keeping with the view that parks should be especially accessible to the latter groups. Without these rules, Benepe argues, we get the tragedy of the commons. Literally. On a given Sunday, Dolores Park looks like the site of a festival. Thousands of people in dozens of ways simultaneously use the park, which the city recently renovated for $20.5 million (last year, the parks department adds, it spent $750,000 just to pick up after everyone there). But all of this works because the designated off-leash dog area is separated from where people play soccer games, which is separated from where families picnic. It works because there's a mechanism to clean up the place and money to do so. There are rules that govern the park, even if it feels like there aren't. That doesn't mean people who love the place are wrong to be vigilant about anything that might threaten the public's access. But a reservation system for a limited portion of land isn't necessarily an attack on working-class picnics. ""Parks and public spaces are at the epicenter of democracy in many cities, so they become politically and emotionally loaded,"" Benepe says. It's no coincidence that the Occupy movement began in parks, or that the Million Man March gathered on the Mall in D.C., or that protests of the 1968 Democratic National Convention formed in Chicago's Grant Park. Parks are political, and they give people power. And that in itself is worth defending. But then, Benepe says, you also get ""politicians pandering saying ‘the grass should be free.' And that sounds right. But there’s no such thing as truly free.""","set off the city's easily ignited outrage. More than 17,000 people signed a Change.org petition to end the reservations"

438,"[image-51] [image-78] [image-94] YouTube is a great place to find blooper, snuggly kitten or music videos. Now, it’s also a place to post grand ideas for microgravity research studies. Two of those ideas actually got to fly to the International Space Station. The YouTube Space Lab competition provided just such an opportunity, and three students saw their research performed aboard the orbiting laboratory. For then-high school students Dorothy Chen and Sara Ma of Troy, Mich. and Amr Mohamed of Alexandria, Egypt, the sky no longer is the limit for their research questions. Chen, Ma and Mohamed completed research investigations as winners of the YouTube Space Lab global contest. The competition invited 14- to 18-year-old students to submit two-minute videos via YouTube to propose physics or biology investigations for astronauts to perform aboard the space station. Their research was chosen out of more than 2,000 entries received from around the world. The two winning studies looked at the anti-fungal properties of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in microgravity, and the predatory behavior of Salticus scenicus and Phiddipus johnsoni, also known as a zebra jumping spider and a red-backed jumping spider, respectively. The results they received from their research informed them that microgravity can be a wily participant in a research study held aboard an orbiting laboratory in space. In a live video stream with the space station, Chen, Ma, Mohamed and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams were interviewed by Bill Nye the Science Guy about the two investigations. ""To see it working is just mind-blowing,"" said Chen, after talking with Williams on the station about her project. ""It’s weird,"" remarked Ma, ""it’s like we saw the prototype for our bacteria container, and now [Williams] is holding it. It’s just really surreal."" Chen and Ma hypothesized that B. subtilis, a naturally occurring bacteria commonly used as an anti-fungal agent for agricultural crops, would have increased anti-fungal properties when grown in microgravity compared to the same bacteria produced on Earth. Their testing also added phosphates and nitrates to the B. subtilis nutrient source to see if the additives affected growth and anti-fungal strength. The phosphates and nitrates acted as nutrients to potentially boost growth of the bacteria. The outcome of their investigation aboard the space station showed that the least amount of growth in the bacteria occurred in microgravity as compared to bacteria produced on Earth. They found that microgravity had no effect on the degree to which phosphates and nitrates affect B. subtilis growth. In reaction to the results of her study with Ma, Chen said, ""It was a little difficult to make hypotheses about the reason for the results since we never directly interacted with our experiment, but we think it may have to do with the specific strain of B. subtilis that we used."" For additional study, ""I would want to include a control strain,"" added Chen. When asked how the experience of having her research conducted aboard the space station impacted her career goals, Chen said, ""It has made me much more curious about the possibilities of research aboard the space station or in microgravity in general."" Mohamed, now a college student in California, was excited about seeing his zebra jumping spider research in action while talking with Williams in orbit. ""The best scientists and astronauts are the ones who work on the station, and it’s an honor to have my own experiment be done there."" Mohamed's research hypothesized that jumping spiders, like the zebra and red-backed species, would not be able to adapt their hunting abilities to microgravity. Jumping spiders do not build webs for catching their food, instead using their vision to hunt prey, jumping and striking with a fatal bite. This hypothesis was proven wrong while the investigation was conducted aboard the space station, as the spiders did adapt to microgravity to catch prey. ""The results did indeed contradict my hypothesis, which was very exciting,"" exclaimed Mohamed. ""I think it is boring when experiments turn out as expected or when the universe behaves as observed."" ""This competition was by far the best experience of my life. It is something that will stay with me forever,"" says Mohamed, when asked how the experience of having his research conducted aboard the space station impacted his career goals. ""I am currently studying engineering at my [college] in California. I am involved with the Student Space Flight Initiative. I really want space exploration to be a part of my future."" In appreciation of the YouTube Space Lab Project, NASA, the American Astronautical Society and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space recognized Zahaan Bharmal of Google for the project as a Top Education Application on the International Space Station in 2012.

""The first man or woman to one day walk on Mars is, today, a child,"" said Bharmal.

441,"Good old tap water will go a long way toward washing pesticide residues off your fruit and vegetables, but ""getting it down to zero is not feasible, ever,"" said Dave Stone, a toxicologist who is the director of theNational Pesticide Information Center, a cooperative effort between Oregon State University and the Environmental Protection Agency. While washing can reduce pesticide residues on the surface, it cannot eliminate pesticides that are absorbed by the roots into the very tissue of the fruit or vegetable. Scrubbing with a vegetable brush helps, Dr. Stone said, but using a store-bought veggie wash might not: A 2000 study by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station found that rinsing lettuce, strawberries and tomatoes under tap water for 60 seconds worked just as well as using a commercial vegetable wash to significantly reduce pesticide residues. Using a veggie wash might even backfire, Dr. Stone said, because detergent residue could be added to fruits with porous outer layers. The best way to wash is to place the fruit or vegetable in a colander and run water over it, rather than just dunk it in a bowl. ""The force of the running water will drive off residues,"" Dr. Stone said. Peeling also helps get rid of pesticide residues in the skin. The Environmental Working Group’s so-called Dirty Dozen and the Consumer Reports Always Buy Organic list, both of which are based on data from the federal Department of Agriculture, which tests fruits and vegetables after they have been washed, include items deemed to have relatively higher pesticide loads. Both lists include strawberries, nectarines and American-grown apples. If you’re considering buying organic, you might put these items at the top of your list.","While washing can reduce pesticide residues on the surface, it cannot eliminate pesticides that are absorbed by the roots into the very tissue of the fruit or vegetable"

445,"Premium gas sounds like it’s something special, but it actually translates into paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars. That's what we found after running tests at our 327-acre track. While some cars require premium gas, many others simply carry a recommendation to use it. We wanted to see whether you can save money by using regular gas in cars that merely carry the recommended premium fuel label. Testing at the Consumer Reports Track To find out whether using regular gas in a vehicle that recommends premium gas had any effect on fuel economy or acceleration, we evaluated two models: the 2015 Acura TLX four-cylinder and the 2016 Nissan Maxima V6. Each recommends but does not require that the owner put in premium gas—guidance found on the placard on the backside of their fuel-filler door and often explained in greater detail within the owner’s manual. So long as you fuel the vehicle in accordance with the manual, you are protected by the powertrain warranty. In order to purge the cars of premium that could be in the fuel system, we drove them nearly dry, then ran through a full tank of regular gas before starting testing. All tests were conducted following our stringent fuel economy test protocol, with consumption measured through an inline fuel meter. Both sedans achieved the same fuel economy when tested with regular fuel as with premium. During this testing, the cars felt and sounded the same; we did not experience any engine pinging or knocking noise in either car when using regular fuel. The owner's manuals indicate that you might notice a decrease in performance when running on regular, but our test results say otherwise. The 0-60 mph acceleration times were identical in the TLX and Maxima on regular and premium gas. We contacted Acura and Nissan, asking both why they recommend premium gas. An Acura spokesperson referred us to the TLX’s owner's manual, which states, ""Use of lower octane gasoline can cause occasional metallic knocking noise in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance."" A Nissan spokesperson wrote in an email that ""it is possible for the same performance to be realized using non-premium fuel."" But the spokesperson did add that there could be some conditions where performance—which includes fuel economy—might be compromised, such as on extremely hot days. Nissan goes on to say that it is recommended to use premium fuel to guarantee advertised performance. © Provided by Consumer Reports Money in Your Pocket While gas prices remain historically low, the cost difference between regular and premium gas has increased over the past year. In 2015, there was a 39-cent difference between regular and premium, according to fuelgaugereport. But as of this writing, there is a 47-cent difference in the national average price of regular and premium gas. And given the lower pump prices overall, that 8 cents is an even greater percentage. Below we highlight the potential savings using regular instead of premium fuel assuming 12,000 miles per year and current gas prices. Fuel Economy Savings Per Year 30 mpg $188 25 mpg $226 20 mpg $282 15 mpg $376 What's the Downside? So it's okay to use regular even if the manufacturer recommends using premium gas. But check your car owner’s manual before making the switch, and remember that some automakers say premium is required. Wondering about the long-term effects of switching to regular fuel? Here's what we know: In conversations with manufacturers, never was there a connection made with using premium fuel for reliability reasons. The manufacturers only talk about higher octane in terms of performance. What's more, in the Acura owner's manual, Acura only recommends using ""top-tier detergent gasoline""—which can be of any octane grade, regular or premium—for performance and reliability reasons. But there is nothing in the manual that equates premium gas with improved reliability. That said, if you make the switch and think your car is performing sluggishly, or you hear knocking or pinging, go back to premium fuel. Beyond these test findings, it is key to note our car reliability data consistently show that the most dependable cars tend to be those running on regular fuel.",paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars

452,"Let's start by saying this: It is a looooong shot for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives this November. Democrats would need effectively run the table of competitive seats as judged by non-partisan political handicappers. But we'll also say this: What was once thought to be pretty much impossible could now be within the realm of possibility. And there could be a specific way to measure whether such a once-fanciful dream for Democrats could come true: The percentage of the vote the Democratic presidential nominee gets in November. For reasons we'll get into below, Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics think that number is 54 percent. And for reasons we'll get into below, that number's a long shot, too. It'd be the highest percentage a winning presidential candidate has received in two decades. Let's back up for a minute and explain why the House could be in play this November. It's all thanks to the guys Republicans appear to be on their way to nominating for president: either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Nonpartisan analysts who study this kind of thing for a living think either a Trump or Cruz nomination would be untenable for so many Americans that it could knock off Republicans further down the ticket -- perhaps enough to give Democrats the 30 seats they need to win the majority. (The current breakdown in the House is 246 Republicans to 188 Democrats.) The simplest explanation for that phenomenon is that people who come out to vote for the Democratic nominee are simply more likely than not to just check the ballot for Democrats all the way down. If enough Democrats come out and enough Republicans don't, lots and lots of Democrats win. [The top 10 House seats most likely to flip in 2016] So what is ""enough""? Well, in 2012, President Obama won almost exactly 52 percent of the vote.* That, as you'll recall, was not enough of a wave to swing the House in his direction; Republicans picked up a net 13 seats. Using the 2012 election and its effect on down-ballot races as a baseline, Kondik and Skelley crunched the numbers and found that Hillary Clinton (or Bernie Sanders) would have to get 54 percent of the vote in November to give Democrats a shot at winning the House. Such a high turnout on their side would essentially give Democrats a chance to net 35 House seats, which is five more than they need to get the majority. Upping Obama's victory by two points might sound relatively doable -- it's not 10 points, for example. But it's not all that easy, for a few reasons: Two points is a lot for a presidential candidate to scrape together in our highly polarized nation. As Kondik and Skelley point out, it's several points more than any presidential winner has gotten this century. Not since Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, won in 1996 with 54.7 percent of the vote has a candidate received 54 percent (even Obama's historic 2008 win earned him 53.7 percent). What's more, for the past seven presidential elections, neither candidate has gotten more than 55 percent of the vote. Clinton, who is the party's most likely nominee, doesn't seem to be the one to break that historical pattern. She's not well-liked in some critical swing states, like in Pennsylvania, where a recent Quinnipiac poll shows 59 percent of voters view her unfavorably, while just 35 percent view her favorably. In 2008, 65 percent of Pennsylvania voters liked Obama, according to a Marist poll taken a month before the election. It's just one state, but those numbers suggest Clinton has a lot of ground to make up -- and then some -- if she's going to win by more than Obama did in 2008. There's also early evidence that Republican voters who want an outsider for president (aka Trump and Cruz) are fine sending an incumbent back to Congress to work with him. So far, all incumbent Republicans who have been challenged by someone from their own party have won those primaries. And then there's the wildcard factor, which is that no one really knows what's going to happen this election. If you would have told us a year ago that we'd be writing a story about Democrats' potential for erasing Republicans' majority in the House, we'd probably laugh. As Republicans like to say, the last time their party held a bigger majority in the House, Babe Ruth was playing for the Yankees. It just didn't seem within Democrats' reach anytime this decade. But if there's one thing this election has taught us, it's that the old rules may no longer apply. And that's the biggest caveat of all. All of this is really an educated guess -- by very smart people, no doubt, but just a guess. We're trying to use the old rules to interpret the new. Which means seven months from now, we might be laughing at this article's predictions, too. *For the purpose of determining which party controls congressional seats, we and the University of Virginia are measuring all vote totals as between the two major parties. So among Democratic and Republican voters, Obama got almost 52 percent of the vote, and Hillary Clinton would have to get 54 percent of the two-party vote. The number changes when you add in non-major party voters, like independents, etc.","net 35 House seats, which is five more than they need to get the majority"

467,"Why Jeff Goldblum Plans To Sneak Into A Movie Theater Showing Independence Day 2 By Sean O'Connell Roland Emmerich makes movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Not just a big screen. The biggest screen possible. From the monumental explosions of Independence Day (pun intended) to the planet-rattling chaos of 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, Emmerich specializes in sequences that fill every inch of the screen with practical and digital madness. Which is exactly why Jeff Goldblum plans to see his latest collaboration with Emmerich -- Independence Day: Resurgence -- in a theater, with a paying crowd, to appreciate how they react to the insanity. Late last year, I was lucky enough to travel to New Mexico and watch Emmerich at work on the set of Independence Day: Resurgence. It looked like a massive undertaking, and I peppered the cast with questions about the process of working on such an epic blockbuster. Jeff Goldblum, over the course of one of his answers, talked about the joy of seeing one of Emmerich's movies with a crowd, and told me the following reason why he plans to sneak in while the movie's playing and enjoy it with a public audience: You've asked the right person... because I do like to watch movies. ... I'm thinking of several scenes. It's a spectacular... once again, you can imagine, there's much spectacle. I will tell you this. There's more spectacle than I have seen in any... I think it moves the ball, it raises the bar, whatever metaphor I'm stupidly trying to think of, ahead. So it's going to be something that, even though you think you have seen everything before, you'll go, 'I never... That's bigger, and more than I thought!' So some of that. And I'll enjoy that. And like the last one, it's got some heart, I believe. Roland Emmerich is a person of soulful wisdom and humanity. Once again, he's very interested and passionate about creating characters that, for him, tell a story of loveliness and love, of comradeship and some very touching and sweet and funny things. He's got a very keen sense of humor. So I'm hoping that those moments will be delightful in those ways. And I can imagine, you know, watching it with the audience! If you can believe it, during that last bit of his answer, Jeff Goldblum actually pantomimed himself eating popcorn, surrounded by an audience as they enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence together. This is only part of his incredible explanation of the joy of working with Roland Emmerich, so you really have to watch the above clip to get the Full Goldblum, as I now like to call it. Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film. Humanity is using alien tech acquired from our original encounter with the intergalactic species to bolster our planet's defense systems. Only, the aliens are back... and they are better prepared.

Research reveals that people who are drawn to bitter-tasting drinks are more likely to be narcissistic and sadistic. Could your favourite boozy treat say something about your personality? The study was led by Professor Christina Sagioglou from Innsbruck University in Austria and involved almost 1,000 test subjects. Findings suggested that people who opted for stronger, sharper flavours were more likely to experience a ""thrill"" when they felt discomfort. The strong flavour of gin could give drinkers a rush of adrenaline Professor Sagioglou explained that the sensation can be ""compared to a rollercoaster ride, where people enjoy things that induce fear"". First, the participants were asked to rank a list of sweet, salty and sour foods on a six point scale ranging from ‘dislike strongly’ to ‘like strongly’. After registering their taste preferences, subjects were given four different personality tests that measured aggression, selfishness, psychopathy and narcissism. During the testing, participants were asked to give assessments on statements such as: ""Given enough provocation, I may hit someone"" and ""I enjoy tormenting people"". They were also questioned about extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Coffee drinkers may also tend towards exhibiting these personality trends Trends in the results showed that bitter taste preferences were strongly associated with psychopathic tendencies. This means that those who were drawn to drinks, such as a refreshing gin and tonic or an invigorating cup of coffee, were more likely to be narcissistic. In contrast, those who registered an aversion to bitter foods were linked to more agreeable personality traits, such as being kind, sympathetic and cooperative.",Research reveals that people who are drawn to bitter-tasting drinks are more likely to be narcissistic and sadistic

474,"Voter-ID laws are part of a hoary American tradition holding that people who aren't economically independent can't make reasoned political choices. If Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters succeed in booting C.Y. Leung from power, the city’s unelected chief executive should consider coming to the United States. He might fit in well in the Republican Party. In an interview Monday with The New York Times and other foreign newspapers, Leung explained that Beijing cannot permit the direct election of Hong Kong’s leaders because doing so would empower ""the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month."" Leung instead defended the current plan to have a committee of roughly 1,200 eminent citizens vet potential contenders because doing so, in the Times’ words, ""would insulate candidates from popular pressure to create a welfare state, and would allow the city government to follow more business-friendly policies."" If that sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Leung’s views about the proper relationship between democracy and economic policy represent a more extreme version of the views supported by many in today’s GOP. Start with Mitt Romney. In 2012, at a fundraiser with ultra-wealthy donors, the Republican nominee famously denigrated the ""47 percent"" of Americans who ""believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing""—to a welfare state. Because these self-appointed ""victims"" were voting in order to get things from government, Romney argued, their motives were inferior to the potential Romney voters who ""take personal responsibility and care for their lives."" In distinguishing between Americans whose economic independence permits them to make reasoned political choices and those who because of their poverty cannot, Romney was channeling a hoary American tradition. In 1776, John Adams argued that men (let alone women) ""who are wholly destitute of Property"" were ""too dependent upon other Men to have a Will of their own."" In 1800, only three states allowed property-less white men to vote. For most of the 20th century, southern states imposed ""poll taxes"" that effectively barred not only African Americans from voting but some poor whites as well. Romney didn’t suggest that the 47 percent be denied the right to vote, of course. But other Republicans have flirted with the idea. In 2010, Tea Party Nation President Judson Phillips observed that ""The Founding Fathers ... put certain restrictions on who gets the right to vote ... one of those was you had to be a property owner. And that makes a lot of sense, because if you’re a property owner you actually have a vested stake in the community."" In 2011, Iowa Representative Steve King made a similar observation, noting approvingly, ""There was a time in American history when you had to be a male property owner in order to vote. The reason for that was, because [the Founding Fathers] wanted the people who voted—that set the public policy, that decided on the taxes and the spending—to have some skin in the game. Now we have data out there that shows that 47 percent of American households don’t pay taxes ... But many of them are voting. And when they vote, they vote for more government benefits."" In 2012, Florida House candidate Ted Yoho remarked, ""I’ve had some radical ideas about voting and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote."" Yoho went on to win the election. Philips, King, and Yoho are outliers. Most prominent Republicans would never propose that poor people be denied the franchise. But they support policies that do just that. When GOP legislatures make it harder to vote—either by restricting early voting, limiting the hours that polls remain open, requiring voter identification or disenfranchising ex-felons—the press usually focuses on the disproportionate impact on racial minorities and Democrats. But the most profound impact may be on the poor. Voter-identification laws, in particular, act as new form of poll tax. After Texas passed its voter-ID law, a study found that Texans who earned less than $20,000 per year were more than 10 times more likely to lack the necessary identification than Texans who earned more than $150,000. On the surface, this discrepancy might seem possible to remedy, since courts have generally demanded that the states that require voter identification provide some form of ID for free. But there’s a catch. Acquiring that free ID requires showing another form of identification—and those cost money. In the states with voter-ID laws, notes a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, ""Birth certificates can cost between $8 and $25. Marriage licenses, required for married women whose birth certificates include a maiden name, can cost between $8 and $20. By comparison, the notorious poll tax—outlawed during the civil rights era—cost $10.64 in current dollars."" To make matters worse, roughly half a million people without access to a car live more than 10 miles from the nearest office that regularly issues IDs. And the states that require IDs, which just happen to be mostly in the south, also just happen to have some of the worst public transportation in the country. Not surprisingly, a 2007 study by researchers at Washington University and Cal Tech found that, ""registered voters with low levels of educational attainment or lower levels of income are less likely to vote the more restrictive the voter identification regime."" Barring former felons from voting has an even more dramatic impact on the poor, since almost half of state prison inmates earned less than $10,000 in the year before their incarceration. Obviously, the United States is not Hong Kong. But there’s a reason some of the city’s demonstrators have adopted the label ""Occupy."" Like the Americans who assembled in Zuccotti Park in 2011, they are fighting a system in which political exclusion and economic exclusion reinforce each other. Hong Kong’s chief oligarch is named C.Y. Leung. But here in the U.S., we have ours too.","Voter-identification laws, in particular, act as new form of poll tax.

478,"What the GOOP just came out of your mouth, Gwyneth?! Ms. Paltrow was on ""Chelsea Lately"" earlier this week speaking with her good friend Chelsea Handler to promote her new sex addiction romantic comedy, ""Thanks For Sharing,"" but it seems like she shared a little too much when she revealed her plans for her upcoming 41st birthday. What does she plan to do? Binge on food from anti-gay fast food chain, Chick-Fil-A! Now, now, before you start burning your VHS copies of ""Shakespeare In Love,"" Paltrow has been through a lot lately and maybe her questionable answer is the result of being frazzled while trying to keep up with Handler's witty banter. As she discusses during her interview, Paltrow recently moved back to LA after a decade-long stint in London (she'd better be careful on her new Vespa!), so maybe it's stress from the intercontinental move. We're sure Gwyneth does not want to be thought of as hobknobbin' with not-so-LGBT-friendly Chick-Fil-A devotees like Michelle Bachman and Sarah Palin. You do you, Gwyneth... just don't eat those anti-gay waffle fries while doin' it -- and promise to think next time before you endorse a fast food chain that has such a terrible track record when it comes to LGBT people.","Binge on food from anti-gay fast food chain, Chick-Fil-A!"
484,"Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, gas giant, and subject of the Juno mission , is huge. Huge. It's so huge, in fact, that it doesn't actually orbit the sun. Not exactly. With 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, it's big enough that the center of gravity between Jupiter and the sun doesn't actually reside inside the sun — rather, at a point in space just above the sun's surface. Here's how that works. When a small object orbits a big object in space, the less massive one doesn't really travel in a perfect circle around the larger one. Rather, both objects orbit a combined center of gravity. In situations we're familiar with — like Earth orbiting the much-larger sun — the center of gravity resides so close to the center of the larger object that the impact of this phenomenon is negligible. The bigger object doesn't seem to move, and the smaller one draws a circle around it. But reality is always more complicated. For example: When the International Space Station (ISS) orbits the Earth, both the Earth and the space station orbit their combined center of gravity. But that center of gravity is so absurdly close to the center of the Earth that the planet's motion around the point is impossible to spot — and the ISS describes a near-perfect circle around the whole planet. The same truth holds when most planets orbit the sun. Sol is just so much larger than Earth, Venus, Mercury, or even Saturn that their centers of mass with the sun all lie deep within the star itself. Not so with Jupiter. The gas giant is so big that its center of mass with the sun, or barycenter, actually lies 1.07 solar radii from the middle of the sun — or 7% of a sun-radius above the sun's surface. Both the Sun and Jupiter orbit around that point in space. This not-to-scale gif from NASA illustrates the effect: That is, in essence, how Jupiter and the sun move through space together — though the distances and sizes are far different. Jupiter is still only a fraction of the sun's size. But next time someone asks you for a crazy space fact you'll know: Jupiter is so massive, it doesn't orbit the sun.","With 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, it's big enough that the center of gravity between Jupiter and the sun doesn't actually reside inside the sun — rather, at a point in space just above the sun's surface."
486,"A recent study published in the journal Cancer Causes and Control has revealed that Amish people have virtually no cancer within their population, and are considered the most healthy people in America. Researchers from Ohio State University originally launched a study on the Amish population to see whether rates of cancer would be higher due to their lack of conventional medical care. What they found, however, shocked them. The Amish were found to have much lower rates of cancer than the rest of the population, so researchers decided to look more closely at their lifestyle choices and diets to find out why. Most Amish people do not smoke or drink and they are typically not sexually promiscuous, leading researchers to believe that these lifestyle factors play an important role in the limited number of cancer cases. Other factors examined include the high amount of physical labor undertaken by the Amish. Most Amish people work in farming, construction, and other production jobs that require intense physical activity that keeps them healthy and in shape. While the rest of America sits in fluorescent-lit cubicles all day, the Amish work hard to produce crops, build furniture and structures, and produce useful goods, which researchers recognize contributes to their excellent health. Another important factor not specifically examined in the study is the fact that the Amish grow and raise all their own food. They employ time-tested, organic methods that provide them with healthy fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, and other untainted foods that most Americans never get. Rich in living enzymes, vitamins, and nutrients Amish food is grown and raised the way it should be, resulting in improved health. While some may ridicule their secluded lifestyle, the Amish commitment to simple, productive lives and clean, local food is benefiting their health in ways that the rest of America can only dream about. When compared to a life of sitting in office buildings all day, eating processed and genetically-modified junk food , and popping prescription medications, it becomes clear which lifestyle is truly deserving of contempt.","Most Amish people do not smoke or drink and they are typically not sexually promiscuous, leading researchers to believe that these lifestyle factors play an important role in the limited number of cancer cases."
487,"A Georgia teen was arrested this week after police found what appeared to be a homemade pipe bomb and hand grenade in his house. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the 13-year-old boy's mother came across something suspicious -- a knife sewn into the lining of her son's jacket -- and called local authorities. Walton County sheriff's deputies discovered the explosive devices during a search of the house and enlisted a bomb squad to safely recover the volatile weapons. ""One was what you would consider a small pipe bomb and the other one was an inert grenade, hand grenade that he had packed full of powder and some fragments with percussion where you could throw it and it would go off,"" Captain Greg Hall told Fox 5 Atlanta. The teen was set to appear in court for another case Tuesday morning, and his mother told authorities that he would have worn the jacket with the hidden weapon. However, police do not know whether the boy intended to use the devices.

490,"Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it? Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic. Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said. Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones. Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food? What the heck does organic mean anyway? Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed. ""By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,"" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email. When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says ""100 percent organic"" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. ""Organic,"" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while ""made with organic ingredients"" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients. There’s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an ""excuse to charge more."" Indeed, there’s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are. Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not. A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and ""substantially higher"" levels of antioxidants. Other ways of measuring ""worth"": When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth’s well-being, too. ""When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,"" she told HuffPost. ""Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me."" According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health. But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit. Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation. Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large. ""Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,"" he said. ""It’s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly."" According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that’s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers. ""Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,"" the nonprofit writes. Many organic farms are small operations, though ""big organic"" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce. Organic on a budget Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just ""buy organic to the extent you can, when you can."" And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply): 1. Prioritize your purchases. ""It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,"" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University’s Pancreas Center, in a blog post. She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible. ""Some companies aren’t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,"" she said. Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. ""The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,"" said Lu. For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable. ""Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,"" said Gerszberg. The Environmental Working Group's ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Clean Fifteen"" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The ""clean"" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower. 2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce. Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative. ""The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,"" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. ""Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities."" Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation. It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less. 3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too. Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products. 4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals. 5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience. Good Housekeeping has some tips on how to start your own organic garden. Live in a small apartment? The Urban Organic Gardener website's got you covered. The bottom line So is buying organic worth it? Depending on your priorities, it might be. Ultimately, many experts agree that eating a balanced diet, while remaining conscientious about how your food choices impact the health of the planet and farming communities, is key. And if you're not able to pay for that fancy, organic apple, a fear of pesticides shouldn't be a barrier to consuming lots of nutritious produce. ""Eating fruits and vegetables is good for health, whether organic or not,"" said Nestle.","Depending on your priorities, it might be"
492,"This weekend, I had the opportunity to see the play Pay Up here in Philadelphia by the inimitable Pig Iron Theatre Company. If you're looking for a review, you won't find it here, other than to say -- if you live in this city and if you can, try to get tickets. The piece deals with the intersection of art and commerce, of emotion and human psychology, and it is funny and moving in a way that I can't quite articulate just yet. Here's what I actually want to talk about. I went home and began to leaf through the playbill, a slim, stapled offering handed to me upon my exit. The quote that stopped me dead in my tracks was tucked into a tiny back corner of the program, buried under the lists of donors and sponsors and advertising. Printed at the very bottom of the page, here's what I read: I don't know if this blew your mind, but mine exploded across the kitchen. Bear with me on this, because I really need to reason this out. Let's say I'm in the grocery store, and I'm in the mood for jam. OK. I can deal with this. Cherry. Blueberry. Lemon. Raspberry. Mint. Orange. I can narrow this down pretty quickly. Mint jam is weird. Lemon is too tart. Blueberry and Raspberry are too seedy. Orange is always artificial-tasting. Cherry it is. Let's say I go to a bigger grocery store. Crap. I think I... I mean, I used to like cherry, but... there are so many other kinds out here. I didn't even know they made pomegranate-plum. What's a persimmon again? OK. With me so far? This makes sense. It shouldn't, but it does. Too many choices make me feel anxious. What if I choose incorrectly? Maybe I just don't want jam after all. Forget it. I'll just go home without it, or buy something else instead. After all, the perfect jam has to be out there somewhere. Why waste my time and money on all these other ones? Now. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town. Say, not in the present day. Let's say, just for the sake of argument, I'm a single lady in a small town in some year before the invention of the automobile or the telephone. In order to leave my small town, I would have to travel by horseback. In order to hear news from other places in the world, I would either have to receive a letter, hear someone tell me a story, or go out and find the information myself. Let's say I'm a single lady in a small town and the ol' hormones kicked in and I'm really interested in having sex and, I guess, by association, getting married and making babies. Now, let's go visit that small, hometown grocery store. OK. OK. I can deal with this. Not the one with the crazy eyes. Not the one who smells bad. Probably the one who has a kind smile and seems to think I'm funny. Yeah. OK. Him it is. (For the sake of not being viewed as a total moron, I should state that this is an incredibly simplified way of viewing world history. If you were a woman living in the days before the automobile and the telephone, and you were fortunate enough not to have been born, say, a slave, or a street urchin, or in a time where your father or male relatives could sell you like property, you still simply didn't have a lot of options, and that sucks. Even if you did wind up lucking out with a really delicious kind of jam, like, say, pear, you still kinda had to hope that after years and years and years of eating pear jam for every meal, that you still liked the flavor as much as when you first opened the jar. You kinda just had to hope that pear jam wasn't the kind of saccharine-based life form who would beat you or deny you the right to vote or otherwise generally be an asshole.) OK. Let's say it's somewhat later in our collective history. Let's say we're a single gal in a somewhat larger town. Crap. There's just a lot of choices out there. What if I choose wrong? What if this isn't the one I'm supposed to be with? What if there's someone else out there who is the right flavor, and I made a hasty decision too soon because I thought I was supposed to be done with the grocery shopping by a certain time and place in my life? Ok. Now, let's say it's the year 2013. Let's say you live in a large metropolitan area. Let's say that the last year's census for the city of Philadelphia clocked in at 1,547,607 people. Some of these people are old, some are children, some are married. Approximately 43% of Americans are unmarried and over the age of 18. So, while we're doing some guesstimating here, because I can't find specific information on the number of unmarried folks in Philadelphia per se, let's say that there are approximately 665,471 unmarried people in this city. On average, there are slightly more women than men in this city, but let's make it easy on ourselves and divide that number in half. So, let's just say that there are 332,735.5 unmarried men in this city. (Let's round up to 332,736, because I hate to imagine that poor half-man out there alone in the city on this rainy night). Now, let's look at those 332,736 men. Some of them are probably old. Some of them are probably gay. Some of them probably wear Ed Hardy baseball caps. I can disregard those flavors of jam pretty easily. Still. Just looking at this picture gives me the nervous poops. And this is why online dating made me totally miserable. There were simply too many choices. I was so overwhelmed by the number of options, and yet so oddly disappointed that none of them appeared to say ""Hey! I'm your future husband!"" right there on the page. When there are that many options, it's all the more frustrating that the obvious choice is harder to find. I would scroll through a seemingly endless supply of men who purportedly lived in my very own city but whom I had never seen before, until the only option was to just eliminate people for purely superficial reasons. Works in a bank? Boring. Has a cat? Eh. Has a beard? I guess I like beards. Went to Burning Man? Oh, dear, probably not. All the while, I was equally aware of how many of those same men had to be flipping through a seemingly endless supply of single women, staring at my profile and thinking, ""Likes to read. They all say that. Mel Brooks movies? Whatever. Nice eyes, but a little pudgy around the middle."" I went on one real date. He was nice enough, but I didn't feel the connection, and plus that online superficiality had utterly bled into the real-life encounter. I realized about five minutes into it that he was a totally nice and decent and well-educated person that I had written off upon first glance because he arrived at the bar wearing a pink paisley shirt and purple skinny jeans. I spent the rest of the evening unable to focus on a word he said, because my own inner monologue kept repeating over and over and over, Stop being such a superficial asshole. The night I deleted my account for good, I had gone out dancing with some friends at this big dance party on a boat. It turned into one of those epic evenings where tons of people I know turned up, all of whom work in my industry, all dancing together, just sweating it out on this hot summer night to Michael Jackson and Prince and Beyoncé. And I was having fun, until the very end of the night, where -- cue the world's smallest violin -- everybody else seemed to pair off and disappear together and I was left on South Street, hailing a cab alone. F*ck this, I thought, the Internet is full of all of these other choices! There are literally thousands and thousands of men out there, in the vast array of the universe, in this expansive and vibrant city. I am a smart, capable, attractive, single lady. There's no shame in this. I'm so sick of always going out and seeing the same people, only ever meeting people who work in the same field. I just want to meet someone completely different, someone who is nothing like the people I work with all day and socialize with all night. I turned on the computer and logged into OkCupid. There's this screen when you log in that shows you your ""Three Top-Rated New Matches!"" I sh*t you not, this is what popped up on the homepage: I knew all three. I had kissed ALL three. All three worked in my field. All three were my top-rated matches. All three had been at the boat dance party that night. I deleted the account, put on my pajamas, and ate a bag of popcorn while watching ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" until the sun came up. Somewhere out there, I gotta believe there's a jam jar waiting around for me. I really have to think so. Why else would we have so many stories and fairytales and folklore and mystique about picking the right one off the shelf? At the same time: I'm easily overwhelmed. Thinking about the reality without using metaphor is more complicated, more lonely, more sad. I sometimes catch myself feeling a little jealous of my friends who married young, who stayed in their small-town grocery stores. They seem to have figured something out in a way that I can't, or won't. I read those statistics, the ones in those articles that always have headlines like COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN FREAK SHARKNADO FIRE THAN MARRY AFTER AGE 35, and they wear on my soul in a way that I'm not totally comfortable admitting. The worst part of all of this is, I mostly love my life as a single lady. I really don't have too many complaints. Unlike our theoretical single-gal example from earlier, the one with six options and a horse, I am afforded the benefits of freedom of speech and religion and the right to vote and wear pants and take birth control and get a job and serve in the military. I realize that this complaint might seem incredibly petty. Woe is me! I have too many choices! There are simply too many things to do in this vast and incredible world! I have a job that I love! I surround myself with other single friends who are creative, fun and supportive people! I have dated some extremely smart, talented men, and I'm so glad I didn't have to marry them, because they were totally wrong for me! I get to have the bed to myself every night and no one will care if I eat grilled cheese in it! Poor, poor, single, lonely me, unabashedly living a terrific life! And yet, sometimes, you sit back, and the bed seems kinda empty, and you really just want some f*cking jam. I don't really have a good answer for that. Except, I guess, to take a deep breath. To remember that grocery shopping is not a race. To stop looking at what everyone else has in their shopping cart. And to remember that even though it sucks and it scares me, I have to keep walking back into that store.","When there are that many options, it's all the more frustrating that the obvious choice is harder to find."

Thank goodness I've gotten to the place where I don't compare myself to others. 💕 From when I started modelling at 13 to around 19 (when I was only about a UK 10 or US 6/8) I would have crumbled inside standing next to these two beautiful women and would have been way too insecure to share a pic like this. 😔 Because I hated that my body couldn't be slim. I was told like most of you (from magazines to TV and films) that to be a successful model or women (get the guy, have money, an enviable lifestyle) you had to be slim. 💩 And it took me many years to come to terms with the fact I won't have skinny legs or a thigh gap and that's ok. Because this is my body and my beauty is not defined by my size. I am classed in the fashion industry as plus-size. I could not give a flying F what I'm labelled but I would prefer not to be. The visibility I have (at only a UK14/US12) has many of you questioning well if she's plus-size what am I🤔❓I would prefer that no one was labelled.

496,"Sure, it's enjoyable, but why did it first evolve? MBLifestyle/Shutterstock Considering that it’s happening all the time, everywhere, all across the world, there’s a lot that scientists still don’t know about the female orgasm. Although the debate over the chemistry of female ejaculation has been settled, it’s still not definitively clear how many types of female orgasms there are. The most tantalizing question of all, though, has barely been addressed – namely, what is the evolutionary point of the female orgasm? Writing in the Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution , a team of scientists at Yale University think they’ve come up with an answer. Rather than merely evolving as a trait to accompany the male orgasm, which some presumed was an adaptation to encourage pair-bonding between partners, these researchers have concluded that it was once the key biological trigger required for ovulation to take place. When women orgasm, they release two hormones, oxytocin and prolactin. In the females of wild placental mammals , this type of hormonal discharge actively causes ovulation to begin, and without it, pregnancy would not be possible. The male and female orgasms work together, so to speak, to begin ovulation. It’s likely that the same mechanism initially evolved in human females for precisely the same reason. Over time, women developed the ability to ovulate on cycles independent of male sexual activity. This hormonal function was rendered unnecessary and it became superfluous, but it stuck around in female biology due to its secondary role as a pleasurable bonding mechanism.","actively causes ovulation to begin, and without it, pregnancy would not be possible"
497,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — ""Vinyl"" wasn’t worth it anymore, ""Game of Thrones"" will run for two more seasons, and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" will be back next year. Those were some of the topics that HBO’s new president of programming, Casey Bloys, addressed at a Television Critics Association event here on Saturday. In addition to discussing programming decisions, Mr. Bloys confronted heated questions about whether HBO depicted sexual violence against women far too frequently. Speaking about the premium cable channel’s expensive flop, ""Vinyl,"" Mr. Bloys said that executives had decided to cancel it after taking a hard look. ""Quite frankly, if I’ve got limited resources, there are other things I want to do,"" he said. ""We didn’t think it was worth the producers’ time, our time, our resources to try to move the needle just a little bit more."" He also said that ""Game of Thrones"" would conclude after its eighth season, and he acknowledged that next season’s summer premiere date would mean the show would not be eligible for the 2017 Emmys. ""That’s just something we have to live with,"" he said. For 16 straight years, HBO has led all TV networks with the most Emmy nominations, and ""Game of Thrones"" has been the most nominated show for the last three. With the final seasons of ""The Leftovers"" and ""Girls"" also coming up, Mr. Bloys said he was hopeful that the network’s new slate of shows — including the limited series ""The Night Of,"" the Sarah Jessica Parker dark comedy ""Divorce"" and the science-fiction drama ""Westworld"" — would make up the difference. HBO has been subjected to pointed criticism recently for several scenes featuring sexual violence against women, particularly in ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Night Of"" and ""Westworld."" Throughout a 30-minute news conference, television critics returned to the issue of violence against women. Though Mr. Bloys acknowledged the criticism (""Point taken,"" he said at one point), he also seemed unmoved by the charge and said several times that violence was ""spread equally"" among men and women. ""Is there a lot of violence in ‘Westworld’ and ‘Game of Thrones’?"" he asked. ""I don’t necessarily think it’s isolated to women."" Later on Saturday, Lisa Joy, an executive producer of ""Westworld,"" told reporters and critics that any sexual violence in the show was treated with care and it was ""not about the fetishizing of those acts — it is about exploring the crime."" HBO also announced on Saturday that its beloved 1990s comedy ""The Larry Sanders Show"" would be available on its apps — HBO Go and HBO Now — and would be on demand beginning in September. The show’s creator and star, Garry Shandling, died in March. Mr. Bloys said that ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" would go into production this fall, and the network later confirmed that the show’s ninth season would begin at some point next year. And Mr. Bloys did not rule out that ""True Detective"" could return for a third season, after a disappointing second season. Mr. Bloys also talked briefly about the network’s long-gestating animation project with Jon Stewart, saying it would be a parody of a cable news channel. He said he hoped it would be ""up and running"" in September or October, though HBO had originally said it would premiere earlier this year. And HBO’s devoted interest in politics is not going anywhere. When Mr. Bloys was asked whether the network would be interested in updating its successful TV movie ""Game Change"" about the 2008 election for this year’s wild campaign cycle, he suggested that was a possibility. He said that the makers of ""Game Change,"" Jay Roach and Danny Strong, had been at the Republican National Convention ""poking around.""","""Game of Thrones"" will run for two more seasons"
498,"Overview Taking care of your teeth is important for everyone. So, it’s no surprise that you’re confronted with dozens of toothpastes options when you walk down the oral health aisle. When choosing a toothpaste, most people consider the ingredients, expiration date, the health benefits, and sometimes the flavor. Whitening! Anticavity! Tartar control! Fresh breath! These are all common phrases you’ll see on a tube of toothpaste. There’s also a colored bar on the bottom of toothpaste tubes. Some claim that the color of this bar means a great deal about the toothpaste’s ingredients. Nonetheless, like a lot of stuff floating around on the internet, the claim about these color codes is completely false. The color on the bottom of your toothpaste means absolutely nothing about the ingredients, and you shouldn’t use it to help you decide on a toothpaste. What the toothpaste color codes supposedly mean A fake consumer tip about the color codes of toothpaste tubes has been circulating the internet for quite some time. According to the tip, you should be paying close attention to the bottom of your toothpaste tubes. There’s a small colored square at the bottom and the color, be it black, blue, red, or green, allegedly reveals the ingredients of the toothpaste: green: all natural, blue: natural plus medicine, red: natural and chemical, black: pure chemical Unsurprisingly, this tidbit of internet wisdom is totally false. The colored rectangle actually has nothing to do with the toothpaste’s formulation. It’s simply a mark made during the manufacturing process. The marks are read by light beam sensors, which notify machines where the packaging should be cut, folded, or sealed. These marks do come in many colors and they’re not limited to green, blue, red, and black. Different colors are used on different types of packaging or with different sensors and machines. In other words, all the colors mean exactly the same thing. If you really want to know what’s in your toothpaste, you can always read the ingredients printed on the toothpaste box. Toothpaste ingredients Most toothpastes contain the following ingredients. A humectant material to prevent hardening of the toothpaste after opening, such as: glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol A solid abrasive for removing food debris and polishing teeth, such as: calcium carbonate, silica A binding material, or thickening agent, to stabilize the toothpaste and prevent separation, such as: carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenans, xanthan gum A sweetener — that won’t give you cavities — for taste, such as: sodium saccharin, acesulfame K A flavoring agent, like spearmint, peppermint, anise, bubblegum, or cinnamon. The flavor doesn’t contain sugar. A surfactant to help the toothpaste foam up and to emulsify the flavoring agents. Examples include: sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium N‐lauroyl sarcosinate Fluoride, which is a naturally occurring mineral known for its ability to strengthen enamel and prevent cavities. Fluoride may be listed as sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, or stannous fluoride. The color on the bottom of the tube doesn’t tell you which of the above ingredients is in the toothpaste, or whether it’s considered ""natural"" or ""chemical."" Even if the theory about color codes turned out to be true, it wouldn’t really make sense. Everything – including natural ingredients – is made out of chemicals, and the word ""medicine"" is too vague to really mean anything. If you’re worried about what’s in your toothpaste, read the ingredients printed right on the tube. If in doubt, choose a toothpaste with an American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. The ADA seal means that it’s been tested and proven to be safe and effective for your teeth and overall health. Types of toothpaste Along with the above ingredients, some toothpastes include special ingredients for different reasons. Whitening Whitening toothpaste contains either calcium peroxide or hydrogen peroxide for stain removal and a whitening effect. Sensitive teeth Toothpaste for sensitive teeth includes a desensitizing agent, such as potassium nitrate or strontium chloride. If you’ve ever taken a sip of hot coffee or a bite of ice cream and felt a sharp pain, this type of toothpaste might be right for you. Toothpaste for kids Children’s toothpaste contains less fluoride than toothpastes for adults due to the risk of accidental ingestion. Excess fluoride can damage tooth enamel and cause dental fluorosis. Tartar or plaque control Tartar is hardened plaque. Toothpaste advertised for tartar control may include zinc citrate or triclosan. Toothpaste containing triclosan has been shown in one review to reduce plaque, gingivitis, bleeding gums, and tooth decay when compared to toothpaste that doesn’t contain triclosan. Smoking ""Smokers"" toothpastes have stronger abrasives to remove stains caused by smoking. Fluoride-free Despite strong evidence showing the importance of fluoride for oral health, some consumers are choosing fluoride-free toothpastes. This type of toothpaste will help clean your teeth, but won’t protect them against decay compared with toothpaste that has fluoride. Natural Companies such as Tom's of Maine make natural and herbal toothpastes, many of which avoid fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate. They may contain baking soda, aloe, activated charcoal, essential oils, and other plant extracts. Their health claims usually haven’t been clinically proven. You can also get prescription toothpaste from your dentist for toothpaste that contains even higher amounts of fluoride. Takeaway Everything is a chemical — even natural ingredients. You can completely ignore the color code on the bottom of the tube. It means nothing about the toothpaste’s contents. When choosing a toothpaste, look for an ADA seal of acceptance, an unexpired product, and your favorite flavor. Toothpastes containing fluoride are the most effective for preventing cavities. Talk to a dentist if you still have questions or concerns.","It’s simply a mark made during the manufacturing process.

504,"A new study finds that the wealthiest Americans are less mobile than lower income workers, but those who do relocate are looking for a tax cut. Like its economy, America’s tax system is heavy up top—especially at the state level, where payments from the super-rich form a substantial share of revenue. When hedge-fund magnate David Tepper announced he was moving from New Jersey to Florida, the state estimated that it could face millions of dollars in lost taxes, putting New Jersey’s revenue base and budget at risk. Indeed, income tax rates vary considerably across states, from zero in places like Florida to nearly nine percent or more in states like New York. With inequality rising and related political concerns rising faster still, a number of states have imposed millionaire taxes in an effort to close the growing wealth gap, redistribute income, and generate more revenue. But to what extent do the super-rich actually move away from a state to avoid taxes? That’s the key issue addressed in a new study published in the American Sociological Review by Cristobal Young and Charles Varner of Stanford and Ithai Z. Lurie and Richard Prisinzano from the U.S. Treasury Department. To get at this, the authors used detailed IRS data on the tax returns of all million-dollar income-earners in the U.S. between 1999 and 2011. Strikingly, they find that millionaires move at a lower rate (2.4 percent) than the population as a whole (2.9 percent). The chart below, which tracks migration rates from 1999 to 2011, shows how these rates fall as incomes rise. Those making $10,000 a year have the highest migration rates—about 4.5 percent per year. As incomes climb, the migration rate falls steadily, until it reaches its lowest point (2 percent) for those making $90,000 a year. Once incomes reach millionaire-level, the migration rate increases, but only slightly. As the study points out, ""higher-income earners show greater residential stability ... than do low-income earners."" In other words, the well-off tend to be even more settled than other residents. (Young et al.) ""Persistent millionaires""—those who earn $1 million or more year after year—have the lowest overall migration rates (1.9 percent); substantially less than one-time millionaires (3.2 percent), according to the study. Thus, residents with a consistent flow of wealth are less likely to migrate outside of their own state. ""These results help explain how elite income embeds people in their local regions,"" the authors write. ""People who can expect continuous flows of million-dollar income over time do not tend to move."" In other words, the consistently rich are the most settled of all, mainly because they depend on the places they live for their wealth to begin with. As readers of this site know, the industries and businesses where Americans are likely to make the most money tend to be highly concentrated in high-cost, high-tax locations like New York, D.C., San Francisco, and L.A. That said, those millionaires who do move are more likely to move to a lower-tax state, the study finds. On average, a 10 percent increase in a state’s top tax rate leads to a one percent decline in its millionaires. Still, only around 2 percent of millionaires move due to income taxes, according to the study. To dig deeper into millionaire migration, the study examines the migration patterns for two states with high tax rates (New York and Illinois) and two with no personal income tax (Texas and Florida). In New York and Illinois, the study does find a net out-migration of millionaires, particularly to states with lower tax rates. And in Texas, the study finds a net in-migration of millionaires. Interestingly, all three states saw a large portion of their millionaires migrating to Florida. In fact, Florida has a net in-migration of millionaires from nearly every state in the U.S., especially from those with higher tax rates. The study dubs this influx of millionaires ""the Florida effect."" After removing Florida from the equation, they find little evidence of millionaire migration—even to low- or no-tax states such as Texas, Tennessee, or New Hampshire. The authors also look at the flow of millionaires in counties that border states. The map below shows the tax differences for 1,134 counties adjacent to interstate borders, representing 35 percent of all millionaires and 32 percent of the U.S. population. On the map, high-tax sides of the border are shaded in blue, and low-tax sides are shaded in orange. Those states with the largest tax differences between their borders include Oregon and Washington (7.3 percentage points), Vermont and New Hampshire (6.7), and North Carolina and Tennessee (6.4). Between bordering counties within the same state, the study finds, the county with the higher taxes has a significantly smaller millionaire population. (Young et al.) That said, the study finds no difference in millionaire population between the low- and high-tax counties that straddle state borders. What’s more, millionaire migration does not seem to be affected by shifts in a state’s tax rates. Ultimately, the study finds that, while some millionaires do move to lower-tax destinations, the overall rate of millionaire migration is extremely low. When all is said and done, the super-rich tend to migrate less then the rest of us. The reason for this is simple—most people depend on the places they live for their incomes, since their businesses are based there. Indeed, this new study confirms an increasingly important fact of our economic geography: because some places generate a lot more wealth than others, the amount of money we make is largely tied to where we live.","A new study finds that the wealthiest Americans are less mobile than lower income workers, but those who do relocate are looking for a tax cut."

That man, the notoriously awful Ukranian pseudo-red-carpet-reporter Vitalii Sediuk, is known for assaulting celebrities like America Ferrara, Bradley Cooper, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Adele. Initial reports had Sediuk punching Pitt in the face. Not so, says Pitt in a new interview with People. ""I was at the end of the line signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. I took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels.

508,"It's been just over five years since I first picked up a cigarette—at a party, surrounded by people who seemed much cooler than me by dint of their smoking. Determined to fit in with my new social circle and with my new city—New York, a place where even the corpulent look interesting with a hand-rolled cigarette hanging from their lips—I started smoking socially, and eventually, regularly. Through the years I've quit dozens of times, to no avail. This, like any addiction, is a personal struggle. If you're an addict, no amount of disappointed friend-shaming, bummer chats with parents, or losses of potential girlfriends can make you do something you're not ready to do. I get it. Cigarettes are bad. And yet, despite all that I know about cigarettes and why they're bad, I still fucking like them. All of which brings me to my current situation. After trying for so long to quit, only to disappointingly flip between stopping and guiltily falling off the wagon, I've found a ""healthy"" medium, a half-happy place where I can smoke casually. Actually casually. It started a few months ago, when, feeling dangerously worn out for a 24-year-old, I quit smoking. I knew I wanted 2015 to be different, and I didn't want to wait until my New Year's Resolution to make it so. I joined a gym, changed my diet, and started exercising five times a week. Since November, I've kept it up, shedding some pounds and, more important, feeling better about myself as a human being. Part of this is due to the fact that, about a month into my new routine, I decided that I was doing OK and should probably ease up on my cigarette abstinence. Maybe I could be the kind of guy who keeps a pack at work, I thought, smoking a few here and there. Surprisingly, this worked out pretty well. I continued going to the gym and eating and sleeping well, all while sneaking a few smokes, balancing the good with the bad on a daily basis and seemingly achieving the impossible—gaming the system, being a healthy person while not being an entirely healthy person. The dichotomy also inspired a mutual motivation—if I had a good work out, I definitely deserved a smoke, and if I smoked heavily on a particular day, I definitely ate a healthy lunch. With the devil on one shoulder and angel on the other, I felt like I'd found universal balance. Maybe I didn't have to fully quit after all. Maybe it's possible to lead a healthy life while continuing to smoke regularly. Do we not have to quit? I decided to investigate. ""It's important to first define what is meant by 'a healthy lifestyle,'"" said Dr. Azure B. Thompson, the associate director of policy and research at the CASAColumbia addiction center. Thompson, an expert on the social determinants of substance abuse, said that while a healthy lifestyle is defined by eating well, being active and managing stress, ""people may comply with some of these activities and believe they are leading an 'otherwise healthy lifestyle,' but by smoking cigarettes regularly you are not protecting yourself from harm."" Harm, of course, being stuff like long-term lung damage and increased risk of cancer, heart disease, respiratory disease, and stroke. By smoking while living healthily, you're welcoming dangerous entrants into your body, but it's not like I was smoking a pack a day. If I am letting toxins in, at least it's not like they're waltzing in through the front door. It's more like they're sneaking in through the window I cracked. In theory, I should be able to keep doing what I'm doing so long as I don't fall back into my pack-a-day habit, right? ""I think that is a natural sentiment,"" Thompson countered. ""With some potentially unhealthy behaviors,"" like eating junk food or drinking alcohol, ""we are told that they are OK in moderation, but there is no way to game the harmful effects when it comes to cigarette smoking."" According to Thompson, not only am I not supposed to smoke if I want to live a healthy life, but I'm not even supposed to be near a place where smoking is happening. ""Any exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful,"" she assured me. ""Risks are not limited to heavy or long-term smokers."" Still, living a totally smoke-free existence is an unrealistic ideal: if you're a social person in your 20s, you're bound to be regularly surrounded by smoking peers, and if you live in a major city, second-hand smoke is almost unavoidable. Thompson gave me the answer I knew was coming—of course the addiction researcher is going to tell me not to be addicted! I needed input from another source, so I reached out to Jonathan Henry, a certified personal trainer. Though Henry is a kindergarten teacher who knows a bit about how to compromise with crying six-year-olds, he doesn't compromise in his night work, which is making sure people stop putzing around with their bodies and get healthy to stay that way. ""It is not possible to lead an otherwise healthy lifestyle while smoking cigarettes,"" he told me as soon as I brought up the question of whether or not I could lift and still smoke. ""Doing so is the exact contradiction to living a healthy lifestyle,"" he added for clarity. I should note here that Jonathan trained me once—when I was in my heavy-smoking phase—and nearly made me pass out by telling me to do 100 jumping jacks. Before doing the jumping jacks, I looked and felt like a normal person. ""Even if an individual doesn't look out of shape due to their fast metabolism, eats well, and does some type of exercise,"" Henry told me, through smoking, ""damage is being done to the vital organs and will eventually be visible to the individual and the world."" Jonathan went on to say that if I don't quit smoking soon, even while living my otherwise ""healthy"" lifestyle, my gym routine and diet would eventually fall by the wayside. Still! I'm feeling mostly OK. I no longer struggle when I walk up a few flights of stairs. I don't have an agonizing chest cough, the sort only fellow pack-a-day smokers could relate to. And I don't smell so much like smoke that my mom winces in dismay when I hug her. Everything's fine. Besides, sometimes I need a cigarette. Sometimes things aren't going great at work, my relationship feels more taxing than usual, or I'm just crippled with fear about getting older. You know, just normal 20-something stuff, most of which usually fades away after a smoke break. Even if it's clearly not a physically healthy activity, maybe smoking provides some sort of mental health benefits, especially for those of us who do it to relieve personal stress. I reached out for validation from Margie Cohen, a California-based psychotherapist whose ex-wife was a longtime smoker. Surely she'd understand. ""It is my job to track and respect people's choices,"" said Cohen, ""and especially to help them understand and find new ways to manage the emotions that smoking is helping them medicate."" Some of which, she said, if unchecked can create a distance between a person and the possibility of living a deeply rewarding life. According to Cohen, smoking, like any other addictive substance, while typically mislabeled as a stress reliever, functions more so as a distraction from issues lying beneath the surface. ""It has been my experience that a person's relationship to smoking will become less compelling if they are less fearful of their feelings and of their previous traumatic experiences,"" said Cohen. Cohen seemed to stand firmly beside Henry and Thompson in the belief that smoking is unequivocally bad, both mentally and physically, though she admitted that quitting—an ""empowering choice that will help move a person toward greater fulfillment and happiness""—isn't something she'd push someone to do if they weren't ready. If a person is quitting simply to ""comply with social or internal pressure to 'do what's right,'"" said Cohen, ""it will probably not be a choice they can manage successfully, and may likely add to their stress, self-blame, shame, and low self-esteem."" So according to the experts I spoke with and common sense, it is not possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle without quitting smoking. But the very reason I started living this new life in the first place was to avoid the feelings of stress and low self-esteem Cohen mentioned above, and for the first time in my young life, I've found a footing between careful and irresponsible by forcing myself to sacrifice while allowing myself transgressions. So for now, I'd rather just keep smoking, blindly soldiering on with this unhealthy addiction no matter how painful it may be in the long run.",there is no way to game the harmful effects when it comes to cigarette smoking
515,"LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James directed a cease-and-desist order of sorts Tuesday to LaVar Ball, the outspoken father of three boys -- including star UCLA freshman Lonzo Ball -- who said earlier this month that his children are set up better for future success than those of the Cleveland Cavaliers' star. ""Keep my kids' name out of your mouth, keep my family out of your mouth,"" James told ESPN on Tuesday, as the Cavaliers practiced on UCLA's campus, two days after a victory at the Lakers. ""This is dad to dad. It's a problem now."" James' two sons, 12-year-old LeBron James Jr. and 9-year-old Bryce Maximus James, have shown plenty of promise on the AAU circuit -- to the point where eldest son ""Bronny"" has standing verbal scholarship offers from Duke and Kentucky, as ESPN reported last summer. The Ball family includes Lonzo Ball and his two younger brothers, 18-year-old LiAngelo and 15-year-old LaMelo, who both will attend UCLA on scholarship in the coming years. LaVar Ball has been outspoken on a number of topics regarding his children in recent months, and even brought James' family into the conversation while appearing on a recent episode of the ""In the Zone with Chris Broussard"" podcast. During it, Ball suggested his sons were better set up for future success in basketball than James' because the four-time NBA MVP's pedigree will be too much for them to live up to. ""The monsters in the NBA, their dads wasn't that good,"" Ball said. ""They were OK, they was players, but the fact that the old [Dell] Curry wasn't no All-Star, he wasn't cold. He could shoot the ball, though. Kobe Bryant, his dad wasn't all that, that's why he's such a monster. ""You got LeBron, it's going to be hard for his kids because they are going to look at them like, 'You got to be just like your dad.' And after a while, that pressure starts sitting on you like, 'Why do I got to be just like him? What can't I just be me?' And then they are going to be like, 'Aw, you're soft, you're not that good.' Because the expectation is very, very high."" LaVar Ball also has said he was good enough to ""kill"" Michael Jordan one-on-one in his prime, which would seem to punch a hole in his theory that his sons are better off because their father was not an all-time great. While Ball was critical of James' children, he has offered otherworldly praise to his own, recently causing a stir by saying that Lonzo is already better than back-to-back MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. Curry sidestepped the comparison, telling reporters, ""I don't want to talk about that. I wish his kids the best and I know they'll be great NBA players. That's their job. That's it."" Asked if LaVar Ball's comments would put pressure on his children as they advance in their basketball careers, Curry added: ""Every person should parent their kid as they feel they should."" James has been careful to let his sons live life as any other preteen would, despite their famous father. As Bronny's highlight videos from AAU tournaments have gone viral in recent years, James has stuck to a consistent answer when asked about his son's potential in the sport. ""He has a chance,"" James will often say. ""That's all you can ask for."" As for Lonzo Ball, the 6-foot-6, 190-pound point guard who has led UCLA into the Sweet 16 and is expected to be a top-three pick in the 2017 NBA draft, James was complimentary of his game. ""I actually like his son,"" James told ESPN. ""I like his game."" LaVar Ball, though, is the issue. ""He can talk all about his brand, talk about his sons, talk about basketball, talk about me,"" James told ESPN. ""But keep my family out of this.""","LOS ANGELES -- LeBron James directed a cease-and-desist order of sorts Tuesday to LaVar Ball, the outspoken father of three boys -- including star UCLA freshman Lonzo Ball -- who said earlier this month that his children are set up better for future success than those of the Cleveland Cavaliers' star."

522,"A new study suggests that middle and high school students are eating more fruits and vegetables, exercising more, skipping breakfast less often and eating fewer sweets. At the same time, childhood obesity rates appear to have leveled off for the first time in years. ""It was a bit of a surprise,"" said study coauthor Ronald Iannotti, a professor of exercise and health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a researcher with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. ""Over the last few decades -- the last five, really -- obesity has increased in U.S. adolescents and become a real epidemic."" But the new findings, which were published online in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, suggest that between 2001 and 2009 there was a ""cresting,"" he said. Researchers surveyed more than 9,000 students, in grades six through 10, about their health behaviors as well as their body mass index -- a measure of weight relative to height. During evaluations in 2001-2002, 14.9 percent of the students were considered overweight based on their BMIs, while 10.3 percent were considered obese. By 2005-2006, that had jumped to 17 percent and nearly 13 percent, respectively, but then appeared to level off. Researchers found in 2009-2010, that the percent of children considered obese dipped slightly. Additionally, during the course of the study the number of students who reported eating fruits and vegetables daily increased, as did the number who said they regularly ate breakfast, which in studies has been linked to lower weight and healthier cholesterol levels. The amount of physical activity they got increased during the study period, and the time spent watching TV decreased, although the amount of video game-playing and chatting online remained largely the same. However, the new research does not establish a clear cause-and-effect between the apparent uptick in healthy behavior and leveling off in obesity among adolescents. ""Since we were just taking samples of kids at three points in time, we can't say one is causing the other,"" said Iannotti. However, he said the significant attention in recent years to the health implications associated with obesity has increased parental awareness and may explain why children seem to be leading healthier lives. Other experts are less optimistic. ""Even if obesity rates have stabilized, they're still unacceptably high,"" said Sara Bleich, an associate professor researching the escalation of obesity and its related diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""We're looking at 18 percent in the pediatric population -- almost 1 in 5 kids -- and among minority kids, it's even higher."" An American Heart Association study published last week found that 5 percent of children in the United States are now considered ""severely obese,"" which is defined as having a BMI at least 20 percent higher than 95 percent of children of the same gender in their age group. And though the number of those with healthier habits appears to have increased, or at least remained largely stable during the study period, the overall rates were still low; most did not do an hour or more a day of moderate exercise, or eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. But at this point, with obesity rates as high as they are, any good news -- however minor -- should be considered welcome news, Iannotti argued. ""We're bending the curve. We're starting to reduce that increase [in obesity],"" he said. ""That's good news.""","A new study suggests that middle and high school students are eating more fruits and vegetables, exercising more, skipping breakfast less often and eating fewer sweets.

526,"If you want to know why President-elect Donald Trump is going to be so great not just for America but also for the causes of honest science, common sense, and weapons-grade trolling, look no further than his gloriously provocative recent meeting with William Happer, the Princeton physicist who argues (rightly, by the way) that ‘global warming’ is good for mankind. Professor Happer would make a great pick for a senior scientific post in the Trump administration, perhaps replacing the dismal and somewhat terrifying eugenicist John Holdren as Director of the Office of Science and Technology. First – and perhaps most importantly – it would drive the Greenies to the kind of sphincter-popping apoplexy not seen since Hillary lost the election. Second, in his courage, his decency, and his understanding of the truth about global warming science, Happer is exactly what America needs to restore a semblance of integrity to the discredited world of US government science after years of corruption, incompetence and neglect. To understand why I highly recommend taking time to enjoy this long-read interview about his life and highly distinguished career – the last part of which the liars, thugs and bullies of the climate alarmist establishment did everything in their power to ruin. Short version: Happer knew too much about the truth behind the global warming scam – so the greenies, led by a noisome vice-president by the name of Al Gore, tried to destroy him. About three months after the beginning of the Clinton administration, Hazel O’Leary called me into her office to ask, ""What have you done to Al Gore? I am told I have to fire you."" I assume that the main thing that upset Al Gore (left) was my questioning of blatant propaganda about stratospheric ozone that was his focus at the time: ""ozone holes over Kennebunkport"" and similar nonsense. Being sacked by Al Gore is indeed probably the ultimate badge of honour in any true scientist’s career. In the interview, Happer, a modest man, skips lightly over what must have been a hurtful incident, deeply wounding to his professional pride. But Happer is by no means the only highly talented scientist who has suffered this fate in the last few decades. Basically almost every scientist in a position of public prominence who has dared speak out against the environmental consensus in the US and beyond has been either hounded out of office or, at best, had their life made a misery. Examples include Hal Lewis, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Pat Michaels and, most recently, Judith Curry. In no case was it was because their science was at fault, only their failure to fall in line with the correct Lysenko-like, Establishment-approved ideology. Happer’s scientific bona fides, for example, were – and are – exemplary. He got his job in government as a result of his work on a top secret weapons programme involving lasers. My invention of the sodium guide star gave me some credibility in parts of the US government, but since the work was highly classified in the first few years, only a few scientists knew about it. I scrupulously avoided working on related areas with my university students. But based on this classified notoriety, I was elected to be Chair of the JASON steering committee in 1987, and in 1990 I was appointed Director of the Office of Energy Research at the US Department of Energy (DOE) by President George H. W. Bush, where I served under Secretary of Energy, James Watkins, until the election of President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in the 1992 election. One of the many feeble criticisms against him by Greenies is that ""climate change"" is not his field – a charge he refutes in the interview: I often hear that since I am not a card-carrying climate scientist — that I, and many other scientists with views similar to mine, have no right to criticize the climate establishment. But as I have outlined above, few have a deeper understanding of the basic science of climate than I. Almost all big modern telescopes use my sodium guidestar to correct for atmospheric turbulence. It works. As we will see below, most climate models do not work. The history of science shows many examples of fields that needed outside criticism. A famous example is Andrei Sakharov’s leadership of opposition to Trofim Lysenko’s politicized biology in the Soviet Union. This is a good point. Happer and his fellow climate sceptical scientists are the Western world’s equivalent of the dissident scientists hounded by the Communist authorities in the Soviet era. We in the West may pride ourselves on having  created a world far freer, more open and more just than the one behind the Iron Curtain. But where dissent on matters like climate change is concerned, the treatment of scientists who have differed from the ""consensus"" has been little less disgraceful. Happer, for example, was fairly recently subjected to a sting operation by Greenpeace which attempted to smear him as someone who only speaks out against climate change nonsense in order to make money. The sting operation failed but the experience was horrible. The result of the Greenpeace smear included many hostile, obscene phone calls and emails with threats to me, my family, even my grandchildren. George Orwell wrote about these tactics in his novel, 1984, when he described the daily, obligatory ""Two Minutes of Hate"" for Emmanuel Goldstein (Leon Trotsky) and his agents, who were the enemies of Big Brother (Stalin) and his thugs. It has made Happer more determined than ever to speak the truth about supposed ""man-made"" global warming: The predicted warming from more CO2 is grossly exaggerated. The equilibrium warming from doubling CO2 is not going to be 3° C, which might marginally be considered a problem, but closer to 1° C, which will be beneficial. One should not forget that the ""global warming"" is an average value. There will be little warming in the tropics and little warming at midday. What warming occurs will be mostly in temperate and polar regions, and at night. This will extend the agricultural growing season in many countries like Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. More CO2greatly increases the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants and makes land plants more drought-resistant. So, the net result of more CO2 will be strongly beneficial for humanity. On the role of government in ""combatting"" climate change, Happer echoes Ronald Reagan. Government actions to combat the non-existent problem have blighted the landscape with windmills and solar farms. They have driven up the price of electricity, which has disproportionately harmed the poorest segments of society. Government actions have corrupted science, which has been flooded by money to produce politically correct results. It is time for governments to finally admit the truth about global warming. Warming is not the problem. Government action is the problem. The fact that Donald Trump is taking advice from this excellent man shows that America’s science future – and by extension – the world’s is finally in safe hands. It also serves notice that the Mafia-bullying tactics of organisations like Greenpeace are in future likely to get extremely short shrift from the Trump administration.","look no further than his gloriously provocative recent meeting with William Happer, the Princeton physicist who argues (rightly, by the way) that ‘global warming’ is good for mankind"
528,"'The scene was horrible - especially seeing children wailing and dying in front of you,' says Abd Alkader Habak Distressing images of a man carrying an injured child away from a burning vehicle and another of him weeping next to a boy’s body have emerged from a bombing of a bus convoy that targeted Syrian civilians over the weekend. Photographer Abd Alkader Habak can be seen in one of the images, running away from the scene of the attack with a small boy in his arms. The pictures were shared by the Aleppo Media Centre, an umbrella group of anti-regime journalists and activists. Mr Habak told CNN that he had been documenting the evacuation of civilians from the besieged towns of Kefraya and Foua, held by forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.   As buses passed through Rashidin in rebel territory to a town near Aleppo, the blast occured, briefly knocking him unconscious, he said.  ""The scene was horrible - especially seeing children wailing and dying in front of you,"" he said. ""So I decided along with my colleagues that we'd put our cameras aside and start rescuing injured people."" The first child he checked was dead, he added. The next was breathing raggedly, so Mr Habak picked him up and ran towards the nearest ambulance.  In a second image, Mr Habak is seen kneeling and sobbinh next to the corpse of a dead child, unable to take in what he is witnessing.  The heartbreaking photos, which have been shared online thousands of times, are just one insight into the horrors faced by the Syrian families that day. Families which left the two towns besieged by al Qaeda affiliated rebels after more than two years of enduring mortar fire, snipers and limited food and medical supplies did not make the decision lightly. Many had to leave loved ones behind.  The Qatar and Russia brokered deal also allowed the reciprocal passage of citizens of opposition towns Madaya and Zabadani to pass safely to rebel-controlled Idlib province.  The suicide car bomb attack was reportedly carried out by a man who enticed children waiting near the buses at a checkpoint to come closer to his vehicle by handing out crisps and sweets, several rebel and regime media sources said.  The bombing - which killed 126 people, among them 80 children - has not been claimed. While both sides have blamed the other for the attack, it is likely to have been carried out by extremist factions of Jaish al-Fatah, a rebel umbrella group with al Qaeda links, which was reportedly unhappy that the regime was allegedly bussing out more fighters than agreed.  By midweek the full evacuation programme appeared to have restarted, both rebel and state media said, with 3,000 residents of the pro-government villages Foua and Kefraya leaving on 45 buses.  Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people, including opposition fighters, left Madaya and Zabadani, near Damascus, heading toward northern rebel-held Idlib province.  The multiple-stage transfer deal, which could see 30,000 in total moved across front lines, has been widely criticised as not meeting base-level safety standards. The UN has said the swaps of mostly Shia and Sunni populations amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. Syria's civil war is now in its seventh year. The complex conflict has left 500,000 people dead. ","""So I decided along with my colleagues that we'd put our cameras aside and start rescuing injured people."""
529,"Salt and pepper go together, but salt and slugs don’t pair so well. If you’ve ever battled the slimy gastropods in your garden (or just had a sadistic bent as a kid), you know that a few pinches of salt can kill them. But why? What is it about salt that causes the creepy crawlies to wither? The answer, in a word, is osmosis: the process that occurs when a solution meets a permeable membrane. A solution is a homogenous mixture of two (or more) substances where one substance, the solute, is dissolved in the other, the solvent. When you have a solution on both sides of a permeable membrane, the solvent tends to pass through the membrane to whichever side has more solute so that concentration on both sides is evened out. That’s osmosis. A slug has quite a bit of water inside of it, and the cells that make up its skin have highly permeable membranes. When you sprinkle salt on a slug, it mixes with the water in the mucus that the slug secretes to help it move around, creating a salt-water solution. That solution has a higher salt concentration than the inside of the slug, so osmosis occurs and water from the slug’s skin cells passes through the membranes to dilute the solution and even things out. If you use enough salt, the slug will lose so much water that it dehydrates, dies, and winds up looking pretty shriveled. Humans can handle salt without the same thing happening because our skin isn’t as permeable as a slug’s. Put some salt in your eye, though, and you’ll get a small sense of what the slug is going through.","When you sprinkle salt on a slug, it mixes with the water in the mucus that the slug secretes to help it move around, creating a salt-water solution.

530,"Gone, officially, is the headphone jack from Apple’s new iPhone . Retired. Dead. Defunct. May it rest in peace. As much as users are griping (already) about the disappearance of the 3.5mm jack, which is widely used across many digital devices including Apple’s own laptops, the new options for listening to audio on iPhones—either headphones that plug into the iPhone 7’s Lightning port or wireless ear pieces—potentially offer vast improvements in sound quality.  Apple Here’s why. In oversimplified terms, Apple designed its custom Lightning port to shift more power over to headphones, so the new iPhones are inviting smoother data transference as well as the opportunity for headphone makers to introduce new, innovative features. Tech Radar explains it this way: With Lightning or Bluetooth, the audio signal is transferred to our headphones digitally—meaning that the signal isn’t degraded like it is with a traditional 3.5mm jack. Instead, the audio signals are decoded by the digital-analogue converter (DAC) in our headphones, pulling the bits apart and making them into the smooth analogue sound we know. Simply put, Lightning cables are capable of transferring much more data [than Bluetooth or the 3.mm jack] which means higher fidelity audio in your ears. So, Lightning-connecting headphones and wireless headphones both have the capacity to offer superior quality over what you can get out of the 3.5mm jack on iPhones right now. To the average music listener, does that really make a noticeable difference? The short answer is yes, it can; users who’ve tested high-end Lightning-compatible headphones report a completely reimagined listening experience, with sounds coming through in ""crystalline,"" ""tangible,"" and ""expansive"" form. Wireless Bluetooth technology, too, can offer more pristine quality —and consumers are starting to prefer that option over traditional wired devices anyway, if headphone sales are anything to go by. Audio engineers are actually applauding Apple for scrapping the headphone jack, and the decision should delight hardcore music enthusiasts who’ve complained for years about mediocre sound quality coming out of their iPhones. There are downsides. Upgrading to new hardware can get expensive, and the Lightning port’s total lack of existence anywhere outside of Apple’s product universe (for which we can thank founder Steve Jobs’ meticulous and long-lived insistence on closed design ) means people going for the Lightning-wired headphone option will be buying something that has limited use. Wireless earphones come with their own set of cons, and at $159, Apple isn’t making its own AirPods cheap. But the company’s controversial move isn’t just about the iPhone. It directly encourages third-party headphone makers—and other smartphone companies—to step up their game. At Apple’s big launch event yesterday (Sept. 7), VP of marketing Phil Schiller called the decision to abolish the headphone jack one born out of ""courage."" Though instantly mocked for it, Schiller wasn’t totally wrong. Apple is doing what many other companies have not yet had the guts to try—prodding to the forefront an upgrade that few people would’ve thought they needed otherwise. Update, Sept. 9: Many readers have pointed out that that it is up to third-party headphone makers, and not the technology of the iPhone 7 itself by default, to deliver higher quality audio experiences. They also point out that current iPhones with the 3.5mm jack have mediocre sound quality audio because of the way Apple utilizes the jack. The language of this article has been updated to clarify both points.

533,"President Obama, shown in 2012, has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace during his last few years in office. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) President Obama President Obama commuted the sentences of 214 federal prisoners on Wednesday. At least 67 of them were serving life sentences, many of those for nonviolent drug crimes. The White House The White House points out that Obama has granted ""more commutations than the previous nine presidents combined and more commutations than any individual president in nearly a century."" This is true, but it's also a slightly misleading statistic. When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely. A commutation ""reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction,"" When it comes to granting relief to people convicted of crimes, presidents typically have two options: They can commute a prisoner's sentence or they can pardon the prisoner completely.

But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, Obama has been issuing commutations at a rapid pace in his last few years in office. But he's only issued 70 pardons so far, according to the Justice Department . That's fewer pardons than any president going all the way back to William McKinley, the earliest president for which the Justice Department tracks clemency statistics. For a fuller picture of presidential clemency actions, it's best to compare the average number of pardons and commutations issued by each president per month of their presidencies. That way, you don't have to worry about different amounts of time in office skewing those numbers. Here's what that chart looks like for all pardons and commutations, including the latest batch announced by the Obama administration. At an average of seven pardons or commutations per month, Obama is now issuing clemency actions at a faster pace than any president since Jimmy Carter. But those numbers are still well under historic norms for most of the 20th century. Woodrow Wilson granted pardons and commutations at a rate of nearly 30 per month. Herbert Hoover issued an average of 25 per month. But the clemency picture under Obama is now very different than it was just two years ago, before Obama's clemency work started in earnest. Back then, he was issuing pardons and commutations at a slower rate than any president of the past century. The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as The latest commutations are welcome news for criminal justice reform groups, such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums , which are working to reduce overall prison populations. But absent much larger commutation efforts on a massive scale, a single president's efforts aren't likely to make a huge dent in the federal prison population. Obama's 562 commutations and 70 pardons represent approximately one-third of 1 percent of the total federal prison population of 205,000 inmates — to say nothing of the more than 1.3 million people currently held in state prisons.

534,"The condition is just one of a range of bizarre restrictions in the network’s rules You’ve probably broken the rules of just about every app you use. If you’ve changed your phone number and not immediately told Facebook, you’re infringing the site’s terms of service. Facebook’s ""statement of rights and responsibilities"" requires its users to tell it of any change within 48 hours, as pointed out by The Guardian. It is one of a range of restrictive rules that every person using Facebook has signed up to – whether they actually read them or not. They also include rules that force people not to use any fake information or to have more than one account. Snapchat also forces people to tell it as soon as they change their number, despite a phone number not being anything like a central part of the app. It does give its users slightly longer to do so, requiring it in the first 72 hours of any alteration. While the restriction is likely intended as a way of ensuring that its records on people are up to date and that it can contact them immediately, phones numbers are also valuable information. They help track people around the internet as well as ensuring that people are signing up with their real personal information, which in turn makes the data collected far more valuable. Similar rules are imposed on much of other people’s personal information. Just about every app – including both Snapchat and Facebook – have a clause making clear that it can use any public posts in any way it wants. Snapchat specifically says that it can ""host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute"" content made on the service – whether it is public or not – and makes allowances for screening and looking at snaps even thought they might appear to be very private.

And all that scanning for silver linings and unexpected kindness and moments of joy? Well, that’s basically the difference between a pessimist and an optimist. In fact, when Achor and his team asked a group of mild pessimists to try the habit for 21 days, then re-tested their outlooks with a battery of psychological tests, they found most people in the group tested as mild optimists. ""You can do this with 4-year-old kids or 84-year-old adults,"" says Achor. ""Even a one-minute happiness habit can begin to affect the other 24 hours in your day."" And if you need still more reason to start flexing your gratitude when you reach for the toothpaste, consider this: Achor’s research shows that people with a more positive mindset are 40 percent more likely to get a promotion and report having more creativity and productive energy. As Achor says, ""Most people think happiness follows success, when really investing in your happiness now might be what helps you get there.""","""Try to think of three new things you’re happy about while brushing your teeth at night,"""
538,"PALM SPRINGS, CA (HH) -- According to patients at the Center for Restorative Medicine, a new discovery has completely transformed their lives. Founder and Director Dr. Steven Gundry is a world-renowned heart surgeon, a best-selling author, and the personal physician to celebrities such as Tony Robbins. But his latest medical breakthrough could be the most important accomplishment of his career. In a dramatic press conference yesterday, Dr. Gundry unveiled a simple — yet highly effective — solution to symptoms that plague millions of Americans over 40: low energy, low metabolism and constant fatigue. He went on to say that persistent fatigue can be a warning sign for much more serious health problems...including diabetes, obesity, hypertension and heart disease. ""When you’re feeling low energy, that’s your body screaming HELP!"" He told the crowd of reporters and medical professionals. Dr. Gundry’s radical solution was inspired by a breakthrough with a ""hopeless"" patient who had been massively overweight, chronically fatigued and suffering from severely clogged arteries. The secret to his breakthrough? ""There are key ‘micronutrients’ missing from your diet,"" Dr. Gundry told the room. ""If you can replenish them in very high dosages, the health results are astonishing."" This unorthodox philosophy is what led Dr. Gundry to create the world’s first at-home treatment for fatigue — which has since become remarkably successful with his patients. ""They’re reporting natural, long-lasting energy without a ‘crash’ and they’re feeling slim, fit and active,"" he revealed yesterday. The science behind his formula is brand new, and was met with both fascination and enthusiasm by those in attendance. Immediately following the announcement, Dr. Gundry’s team released a comprehensive video presentation, so that the public can be educated as to exactly how it works. Watch the presentation here: Within just a few hours, this video had gotten thousands of hits, and is now considered to have gone viral. One viewer commented: ""If this works, it’s exactly what I’ve been praying for my whole life. I’ve never seen anything like this solution before...the truth about my diet was shocking and eye-opening."" Of course, Dr. Gundry’s announcement was met with some hesitation. We spoke to some of the doctors who attended the press conference, who advised that people keep their expectations realistic. ""It makes a lot of sense, and it sounds great in theory,"" said Dr. Michael Griffin, a nutritionist based in San Diego. ""But we’ll have to wait and see what the results are. Knowing Dr. Gundry, however, there is a great deal of potential.""","""There are key ‘micronutrients’ missing from your diet,"" Dr. Gundry told the room.

544,"Dimethyltryptamine (DMT): acclaimed as the most fascinating psychoactive substance yet to be discovered. Found in the plants and animals of Earth, DMT exists everywhere in life as we know it, even inside of ourselves. Our familiarity with DMT and its chemical properties has improved, but there remains much to be known as to what exactly one’s consciousness is experiencing while the mind is under the effect of DMT, whether it be endogenous or professionally administered. In Rick Strassman’s book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, he explores the possibility that the vivid, practically tangible realms visited on DMT may actually be our consciousness receiving access to a parallel plain of existence. Similarities in testimonies given by the study volunteers suggest that there may be some validity to this hunch. Each patient experiences their own unique journey with personalized details, however, the overall theme of the reports in juxtaposition was reoccurring: a realm unlike anything of this existence, encounters with intelligent entities, experiences of death and rebirth, unfamiliar sensations, ego disolution, and so on. ""DMT provides regular, repeated, and reliable access to ‘other’ channels. The other planes of existence are always there. In fact, they are right here, transmitting all the time! But we cannot perceive them because we are not designed to do so; our hard-wiring keeps us tuned in to Channel Normal."" – Rick Strassman, M.D. In a correspondence between Strassman and David Deutsch, British scientist and author of The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch expressed doubt in the likeliness of one’s mind actually connecting to a parallel plain of existence as it would require quantum computing. Quantum computing, based on our understanding, requires temperatures near absolute zero in order to take place. Strassman proposed that perhaps it is possible that increased levels of DMT in the mind could be the key to a yet to be understood, quantum computation of the mind that is able to take place in our biological structure. If it’s true that the DMT experience is actually a quantifiable displacement of one’s consciousness, then the answer to interstellar, intergalactic, even interdimensional exploration may reside inside of us. Perhaps with more of its secrets unlocked, Dimethyltryptamine may play a pivotal role in humanity’s understanding of existence.

He’s been called one of the greatest arcade gamers ever, and there’s even a documentary about his insane high score in Donkey Kong called The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. Even with his own full-length documentary film, Mitchell is still best-known for one thing: He was the first person to get a perfect score (3,333,360 points) in Pac-Man. Mitchell set the record in 1999, almost two decades after the game was originally released. ""You start off on the first board, and on board 21, that’s where it reaches the maximum difficulty,"" Mitchell said in a recent interview about the achievement. ""You have to navigate all the way to board 255 doing the same repetitive thing. You can’t miss a dot, a prize, a blue man. You can’t die once.""

547,"Well, there you go. With the Academy Awards, sometimes you just never know. Or, rather you do, if you know where to look. The victory lap for ""Birdman"" at the Oscars on Sunday night, scooping best picture and director, presumably away from ""Boyhood,"" made sense to people well versed in the Academy’s ways. The organization often is deaf, even resistant, to the inclinations of critics, many of whom crowned ""Boyhood"" the year’s best. Entertainment Weekly’s January cover story anointing the film as ""this year’s Oscar front-runner"" probably didn’t help the film’s cause (or, since we’re on the topic, a not-so-flattering piece in The New York Times the weekend voting opened). ""Birdman"" had so many elements for actors and below-the-line craftspeople to chew on: the ballyhooed long shots, which won the cinematographer an Oscar; the actors having to work with clockwork precision; the storyline itself. Seasoned Oscar watchers said they knew it was over for ""Boyhood"" when ""Whiplash"" took the editing award: the Academy’s respect for how Richard Linklater’s film was sewn together by the editor would have to be paramount in order for the picture to win. There was some surprise that Mr. Linklater didn’t collect best director, but as others have noted, the Directors Guild Award – which went this year to Alejandro G. Iñárritu – is often the bellwether of where that Oscar will land. But it was clearly the night for ""Birdman"" – to the great joy of the folks at New Regency and Fox Searchlight, who were behind last year’s winner, too, ""12 Years a Slave."" ""Birdman"" even won best original screenplay, a surprise, since Wes Anderson’s ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" had a story line that was at once more sweeping and more delicate, and collected a Writers Guild Award. Yet every film that had been nominated for best picture collected some kind of award, a nice outcome. And, hurrah, Alexandre Desplat finally won an Oscar for best original soundtrack, for his yodeler-laced compositions for ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" this after getting nominated eight times. (Mind you, two of those nominations were from this year; even he was worried they’d cancel each other out.) It’s good to note, for those still mourning the losses of ""Boyhood,"" that a small independent film about the passing of time wouldn’t have had a chance in many other years, something Mr. Linklater noted on the red carpet.

552,"The impending death of the 3.5mm audio port is one of the more contentious tech industry narratives this year. With Apple rumored to The impending death of the 3.5mm audio port is one of the more contentious tech industry narratives this year. With Apple rumored to remove the jack with the iPhone 7 and devices like the Moto Z already having ditched the port altogether, consumers are justifiably concerned about a standards war they didn't ask for. As it stands, USB-C is only used in a select few phones and laptops like the aforementioned Moto phone and the newer Apple MacBook. Intel, however, thinks the versatile new USB-C standard won't just make for a viable headphone jack replacement, but a superior one as well. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail explained how improvements to the USB-C standard, slated to arrive later this year, could make it a far better port for the modern-day smartphone, At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail explained how improvements to the USB-C standard, slated to arrive later this year, could make it a far better port for the modern-day smartphone, according to CNET . The most obvious advantage, at least to devices manufacturers, is slimmer phones. Without needing to route analog circuitry, a phone maker could switch to digital audio and shave off precious millimeters from the device's body. With digital audio, Sanders added, software and device makers could help cheaper earbuds take advantage of features reserved for more expensive headphones, like noise cancelling and bass boosting. Intel has been one of the biggest proponents of USB-C technology Beyond the need for cumbersome adapters, one of the biggest concerns with the loss of the headphone jack is power use. USB controllers are inherently more power-hungry than a 3.5mm port, and if there's anything that will push consumers to resist change, it's detrimental effects to battery life. Sanders says he and Ismail's revised specifications for USB-C could allow it to detect when users are not using the microphone on headphones and turn it off to save battery. ""The difference in battery life is negligible"" with USB headphones, Sanders suggested. There's also some video potential with USB-C, the duo explained. While not a viable HDMI replacement, USB-C is capable of high-throughput data transfers. That means you could hook a smartphone or computer up to a display through USB-C to run apps or watch movies. It may not be viable for gaming, but it's certainly a way to work around extra cable needs. Plus, USB-C can handle multiple connections at once, so you'd be able to use a USB hub to transmit video or mirror a display from a single port while at the same time charging the device and connecting a separate cable for peripherals. These changes collectively ""will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,"" Sanders concluded. This isn't Intel's first vocal push for USB-C. Back in April, the company detailed a This isn't Intel's first vocal push for USB-C. Back in April, the company detailed a proposal to remove the 3.5mm audio jack at its Shenzhen developer forum. The proposal laid out how the port is antiquated when considering the multi-purpose needs of modern phone users. It's not just video or audio improvements — USB-C opens up the possibility for all sorts of health tracking and other fitness-related functions that can be controlled from a single port. And last year at Computex , Intel became the most high-profile industry name to throw its weight behind USB-C, declaring that its Thunderbolt 3 interface would use the new standard instead of the existing Mini DisplayPort.

554,"Americans aren’t saving enough for retirement. True, this has been a refrain for longer than many can remember. But now some disturbing numbers show exactly how bad it’s gotten. Two-thirds of all Americans don’t contribute anything to a 401(k) or other retirement account available through their employer. Millions aren’t saving on the job because they either don’t have access to a workplace retirement plan or they do but aren’t putting money in it. Many just can’t spare the cash, but a new analysis shows there are other reasons, too. Until now, the exact size of the problem has been unclear. Surveys can be unreliable: Small businesses are difficult to assess, and many workers just don’t know what plan options they have, especially if employers aren’t making much effort to sign them up. Information on a 401(k) may be part of a stack of paper handed out on their first day, that they don’t read or understand, and ultimately set aside and never think about again. Now, U.S. Census Bureau researchers have come up with estimates that rely on tax data, which should be more reliable than surveys. Their conclusion: Only about a third of workers are saving in a 401(k) or similar tax-deferred retirement plan. Also, the gap is far wider than expected between the number of employers offering retirement plans, and the number of workers saving in them. Census researchers Michael Gideon and Joshua Mitchell analyzed W-2 tax records from 2012 to identify 6.2 million unique employers and 155 million individual workers, who held 219 million distinct jobs.  This data produced estimates starkly different from previous surveys. For example, previous estimates suggested more than 40 percent of private-sector employers sponsored a retirement plan. Tax records uncovered a much bigger pool of small businesses, showing that, overall, just 14 percent of all employers offer a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan to their workers. Bigger companies are the likeliest to offer 401(k) plans, and since they employ more people than small firms, skew the overall number of U.S. workers who have the option. Gideon and Mitchell estimate 79 percent of Americans work at places that sponsor a 401(k)-style plan. The good news is that’s more than 20 points higher than previous estimates. The bad news is that just 41 percent of workers at those employers are making contributions to such a plan—more than 20 points lower than previous estimates. The combined result of those two numbers is that just 32 percent of American workers are saving anything in a workplace retirement account. Four out of five workers are employed by companies that offer a 401(k) or similar plan, but most workers aren’t using them—either because they’re not eligible or because they aren’t signing up. Lawmakers have proposed a variety of ways to get more people to save. Several states are experimenting with strategies to get every worker signed up for a retirement account. But they face serious pushback from the Republican-controlled Congress and the financial industry. Census researchers are still studying the tax data, cross-referencing it with other databases to get a fuller picture of how Americans are saving. For example, researchers are using retirement plan filing documents to get a better sense of how many workers are still covered by traditional pensions, also known as defined benefit plans. According to a Pew Charitable Trusts analysis of survey data released Feb. 15, only 10 percent of workers over age 22 have a traditional pension. Just 6 percent of millennials have a pension while 13 percent of baby boomers do. Not surprisingly, the Census data suggest well-paid workers find it easier to save than the lowest-paid. But income isn’t the only factor. Eligibility is also a major issue for part-time workers and people who change jobs frequently. Companies often require employees to work for a certain amount of time before they can sign up for a 401(k), and employers aren’t required to allow part-time workers into a plan until they’ve worked 1,000 hours during the previous year.  Another problem made clear by the new report is that many workers simply don’t know their company 401(k) exists. Workers also might never get around to filling out the paperwork, or could be intimidated and confused by the need to make investment decisions. Companies can help solve all those problem by automatically signing up eligible workers, and requiring them to opt out if they don’t want to participate. Doing so has been proven to boost enrollment, but momentum has now stalled for automatic 401(k) features. California, Oregon, Illinois, Maryland, and Connecticut have started programs designed to encourage workers to save. Employers in those states would be required to either offer a retirement plan, or automatically enroll their workers in a state-sponsored individual retirement account. The states had the blessing of the Obama administration, which issued rules allowing states and even large cities to create portable retirement accounts if they want.  On Feb. 15, however, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to rescind those rules. Echoing the arguments of the financial industry, Republicans argued state auto-enrollment plans constitute unfair competition to the financial industry. If the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump also sign off, any state and city auto-IRA plans would be placed in jeopardy. Whatever the outcome, any effort to get workers to save for retirement faces a daunting challenge: Can Americans spare the money? Student debt and auto loans are at record levels, according to Federal Reserve data released Feb. 16, and overall consumer debt is rising at the fastest pace in three years. Retirement is an important goal, but many Americans seem to have more pressing financial concerns.",Two-thirds of all Americans don’t contribute anything to a 401(k) or other retirement account available through their employer

Once a piece of cheddar has been heated to around 150°F, the matrix of milk proteins that provide its structure begins to break down, and the cheese takes on a creamy texture that many people find appealing. What defines creaminess, and why do people find it so appetizing? That's a mystery. But a group of scientists based in the Netherlands, using experimental vanilla custard, found that the dessert's creaminess depends on factors including its viscosity, homogeneity, and texture and surface appearance. One of the scientists, René de Wijk of Wageningen UR's Food & Biobased Research division, says test subjects were especially inclined toward custards that produce lower friction in the mouth. The same factors may apply to cheese, de Wijk says. Harold McGee, author of On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, adds that the warmth of melted cheese provides its own source of pleasure. Taken together, all the sensations associated with melted cheese—smoothness, gooeyness, and warmth—connote a fatty treat. And humans love fat. Ivan de Araújo, a researcher at Yale, has studied how the nervous system responds to fatty foods.

Three of the seven minors arrested are charged with ""aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, conspiracy to commit aggravated criminal sexual contact, criminal restraint, and hazing for engaging in an act of sexual penetration upon one of the juvenile victims."" The other four are charged ""with various counts including aggravated assault, conspiracy, aggravated criminal sexual contact, hazing and riot by participating in the attack of the remaining victims.""",Penn State University has revoked a scholarship offer to a New Jersey high school senior playing for a football team

586,"For many, the New Year is a time to get back on track with health goals, making it a period ripe for marketers to tout unfounded claims about the benefits of ""detox"" diets. Methods that promise to ""rid your body of toxins"" can include anything from an all juice or liquid diet to pumping your body with multiple herbal supplements and even taking laxatives. But in a new paper published online in the journal BMJ Case Reports, doctors warn that not only do such detox diets not have scientific evidence behind them, they can also be life threatening. The report describes the case of a previously fit 47-year-old woman who was hospitalized after following a New Year’s ""detox"" last year that involved drinking lots of fluids and taking various herbal remedies. She was admitted after a brief period of confusion and repetitive behavior such as grinding her teeth. She then collapsed and suffered a seizure. According to the woman’s family, she had been drinking more water and tea in the previous few days, but they did not think it was excessive. However, she had also been taking herbal remedies, including milk thistle, molkosan, l-theanine, glutamine, vitamin B compound, vervain, sage tea, green tea and valerian root. The doctors concluded that her initial confusion and seizures were caused by a condition called hyponatraemia, which occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low, typically brought on by drinking too much fluids. However, they were unsure what exactly caused the condition in this patient’s case. After researching the herbal remedies that the woman used, the doctors came across another case of a man who had suffered from seizures due to severe hyponatraemia after consuming large amounts of herbal remedies that contained valerian root, along with lemon balm, passion flower, hops and chamomile. In the report, they explain that both patients didn’t seem to drink enough excess fluid to bring on hyponatraemia (typically more than 10 liters per day for someone with healthy kidneys). But they hypothesize that the valerian root may have played a role, potentially altering the body’s threshold and allowing for hyponatraemia to occur at an earlier stage. However, they caution that more scientific evidence is needed in order to draw definitive conclusions that valerian root was to blame. Still, they say the two cases highlight the fact that ""despite marketing suggesting otherwise, all-natural products are not without side effects."" Dr. Nieca Goldberg, cardiologist and director of the Joan H. Tisch Center for Women’s Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, notes that while ""detoxing"" can be a necessary process for people addicted to drugs and alcohol, the average person does not need to take extreme steps to cleanse so-called ""toxins"" out of their system. In fact, the body detoxes naturally.  ""That’s the function of your kidneys,"" Goldberg told CBS News. The author of the case report, Dr. Oliver Toovey of the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the U.K., also said that he would not recommend such a detox regimen to patients. ""The liver plays an important role in breaking down toxins in the body and getting rid of them,"" he told CBS News. ""There is no way to artificially enhance this, nor should anyone need to."" Toovey also points out that the notion of drinking excess water as a way to ""purify and cleanse the body"" can be dangerous. ""The best policy is to rely on your body’s own senses,"" he said. ""If you’re thirsty, drink, and if you’re not, don’t. And bear in mind though that some of your fluid requirement will be in your food so you don’t need to drink all of that amount in glasses of water."" Goldberg recommends that if you’re interested in achieving better health, stick to old-fashioned methods like a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. ""The best way you can keep your body toxin free is living a healthy lifestyle and getting your nutrients from food,"" she said. As for the woman in the case study, doctors said she was released from the hospital after treatment and did not appear to suffer lasting neurological damage.","initial confusion and seizures were caused by a condition called hyponatraemia, which occurs when the level of sodium in the body is abnormally low, typically brought on by drinking too much fluids"
587,"- After much debate, former President Ferdinand Marcos is now to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani despite the majority's objection of President Rodrigo Duterte's decision - Recently, US Army records revealed that Marcos' accounts during his time as a guerilla soldier are not only exaggerated but falsified as well - The former president was apparently arrested and jailed for illegally collecting money for a construction of an airfield in Baguio Another shocking revelation about President Ferdinand Marcos has been released as US Army records disclosed that some of his accounts as a guerilla soldier in World War II has been falsified. These records were formerly classified but since it has been transferred to the US National Archives, it is now available in the Philippines and also comes in a digital format. ABS-CBN News Channel, abbreviated as ANC, has released a brief special report on the matter, tapping Dr. Ricardo Jose to add more details to the released records. Jose, who also serves as the Director of UP Third World Studies Center, claimed that he has spoken to war veterans who knew of Marcos' secret but were afraid to speak up in public. He said that there were eye-witnesses during that time but they asked him not to release the information publicly since he interviewed them during the height of martial law. According to the records, Marcos claimed that his 'Ang Mga Maharlika' o Maharlika guerillas were composed of 8,000 soldiers. US Army examiners deemed this to be an exaggeration. UP Third World Studies Center Director Ricardo Jose (L) and the late president Ferdinand Marcos (R) (photo credit: newsfeed.ph) They also found several anomalies involving money - the former president was arrested and jailed for illegally collecting funds for a supposed airfield in Baguio in December 1944. The construction of the infrastructure was said to be for the rescue of General Manuel Roxas and his family. Marcos also requested to be compensated for his efforts, which consist of P100,000 as well as 500,000 in Japanese notes for the maintenance of his unit. ""Nag-file siya ng compensation for the US sa mga kagamitan niya na nawala sa digmaan which included among other things parang mga cattle sa Mindanao na naturn down ng US,"" Jose said. (He filed a compensation in the US for the equipment that was lost in the war, which included among other things, cattle in Mindanao. It was turned down by the US.) He added that the money Marcos requested cannot be easily approved since during that time even one cent had a value. The report also exposed that members of the Maharlika Unit were doing business with the Japanese by selling strategic sources. Prior to this recently-released information, other war-related news about Marcos was revealed during the 80s. (photo credit: philstar.com) Despite the anomalies presented by the report, Marcos has shown a different motive on his letter requesting recognition from the US. In his letter, he ended his address meant for his fellow guerillas that they should seek peace instead of glory. ""Return to your homes and leave behind the ways of war. Take up the ways of peace - the peace that you have won. And if your name must remain unknown, remember that your greatness lies in this anonymity,"" he wrote.

590,"A video of Mr. Boyd’s shooting, captured by an officer’s helmet camera and released by the Albuquerque Police, fueled the latest protests, most dramatically a march on Sunday that devolved from a peaceful demonstration into fiery street confrontations after protesters blocked Interstate 25, which cuts through the heart of the city. Officers in riot gear released tear gas at a crowd of people gathered by the sprawling University of New Mexico campus, some of whom wore the stylized face mask that has become the symbol of the computer hacking collective Anonymous, which claimed responsibility for a cyberattack that disabled the Albuquerque Police website Sunday. In an interview on Monday, the city’s mayor, Richard J. Berry, said, ""I saw the department act with professionalism and restraint throughout the day."" The shootings — an unusually high number for a department serving a city the size of Albuquerque, with more than 550,000 residents — have raised questions about whether inadequate training may have played a role, Patsy Romero, president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness in New Mexico, said in an interview. The killings also highlight the increasing use by the police of military-style weapons to fight street crime, which some experts have argued are fundamentally changing the nature of urban police work. In Mr. Boyd’s shooting, on March 16, officers tossed a flash grenade, discharged a stun gun and fired six shots from an assault rifle at him, apparently as he turned away. In a news conference on Monday, Albuquerque’s police chief, Gorden Eden, who took over the post in February, said he continued to have faith in his officers but announced that the department was nonetheless reviewing how it recruited and trained them. One of the officers who fired at Mr. Boyd, Keith Sandy, left his last job as a state police trooper under a cloud, having been accused of working a second job while on the clock. Chief Eden described the demonstration on Sunday as a peaceful protest that turned into ""lawless acts by a very angry mob."" Officers used tear gas twice that night — outside the University of New Mexico campus and near the Interstate — seeking to disperse the crowd after they spotted a man brandishing an AK-47, Chief Eden said. Several times, he defended his officers’ response, saying they showed ""remarkable restraint,"" and adding, ""They were spit on, rocks were thrown."" The F.B.I.’s review of the shooting of Mr. Boyd is the first known criminal investigation of the Albuquerque Police Department by the federal authorities, but it comes on the heels of a civil use-of-force inquiry initiated by the Justice Department in 2012. The state’s attorney general, Gary K. King, is also investigating Mr. Boyd’s shooting, as well as the fatal shooting of Alfred Redwine, whom the police shot after he opened fire on them outside a housing complex last week. ""They shoot first and ask questions later,"" Christian St. John, 42, a salesman at a furniture store here, said as he walked along the southeastern edge of downtown, echoing an overwhelming sentiment in this city, which is that the police are not to be trusted. The city dispatched a crew of workers Monday morning to clean up graffiti sprayed during the protest, including on the walls of a police substation on the university campus. As they did it, cracked eggs glistened in the midmorning sun by the substation’s door.","A video of Mr. Boyd’s shooting, captured by an officer’s helmet camera and released by the Albuquerque Police, fueled the latest protests, most dramatically a march on Sunday that devolved from a peaceful demonstration into fiery street confrontations after protesters blocked Interstate 25, which cuts through the heart of the city"

592,"Upon my recent visit to Iraq, I saw the intense psychological distress that over 500,000 Iraqi Yazidis1 experience every day. They have had to abandon their houses and families in order to o survive the violence of the armed group calling itself the Islamic State, who’s made lightning-fast advances throughout the country. All of them suffered the horrors of war in some way, and many of them are still plagued by the effects of post-traumatic stress. The vast majority of the victims are under 18. Young Yazidi in the Dahuk region of northern Iraq What can we do for these uprooted youths, forced to live far from their homes in camps or makeshift shelters? What happens when the closest school is four hours away on foot and so overcrowded it cannot accept any new students? This is why for the last few months Development and Peace, in partnership with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD), has been involved in a project to create youth centres that provide these kids in dire need with a safe space. This tent lets 240 children learn in a fun environment and helps them return to a normal routine. Thanks to our project, over 900 children have access, twice a week, to a tent, the inside of which resembles a classroom. On site, an intervention team offers children a variety of activities and a positive environment in which they can feel safe. Women account for at least 50% of each team, as children are more likely to confide their psychological distress to a woman. Furthermore, some of the staff hired to run these centres are displaced people, in an effort to provide them and their families with extra income. The tents’ interior looks like a classroom, and fun and educational activities are offered to the children. Priority activities Thanks to our partners’ experience with other displaced populations, and after consulting the target population during the analysis phase of the project, it was decided to offer five types of activities in the centres: Recreational games for children; Informal education, by age group, with an emphasis on building vocabulary; Team-spirit building activities; Peaceful conflict-resolution activities; and Activities in which children can talk about the stress they’ve experienced. Colouring activity in the village of Shaekadry’s youth centre (Iraqi Kurdistan) These spaces are also used by the staff to assess the wellbeing of the children, and ensure that they receive the psychological care they might require. Already, close to 50 children have been diagnosed with severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and have been referred to a specialist who will be able to give them proper care. These centres are not meant to replace real schools, but in a context of mass displacement and overcrowded classrooms, they ensure that children can continue their education while on the waiting list to enroll permanently in a local school. Without this interim program, a whole generation might struggle with learning issues and face a bleak future. It is not too late to make a donation and help more children gain access to these centres. Here are a few children I had the privilege of meeting: Sonja, age 15, wants to learn Arabic and English. Lisa, age 11, thanks us for creating this centre. She likes the activities offered, but wishes she could take Arabic lessons. Shamo, age 12, loves it when we teach him some English words. Randy, age 12, is grateful when teachers manage to make him forget ""the things he’s seen"" and hopes to become an engineer. 1Who are the Yazidis? They are a Kurdish-speaking community of about 600,000 people. They are among the oldest ethnoreligious groups of Mesopotamia, where their belief system appeared over 4,000 years ago. The Yazidis are being persecuted by the Islamic State for refusing to convert to Suuni Islam.","The tents’ interior looks like a classroom, and fun and educational activities are offered to the children."
595,"As the backlash against Judge Aaron Persky grows, new details regarding his lenient six-month sentence for convicted rapist Brock Turner continue to emerge. The latest is truly appalling, and finally explains the thinking behind the otherwise inexplicable sentence. A transcript of the Brock Turner sentencing hearing quotes the judge as saying, ""I take him at his word."" Yes, you heard that right: He believes Turner's version of the events. Believe it or not, it gets worse when you hear the full context. Turner's lawyer had argued at the June 2 hearing that Turner admitted to ""digitally penetrating"" the women, but that Turner claims he recalls the victim giving consent. Judge Persky believed him. Here's what he said: ""I mean, I take him at his word that, subjectively, that's his version of events. The jury, obviously, found it not to be the sequence of events."" In essence, this implies the judge disregarded the jury's conviction and used his own judgment to decide the punishment for the three felony charges. According to The Washington Post, Judge Persky also remarked that Turner's regret or guilt was real — despite Turner never accepting the charge. Post reporter Susan Svrluga wrote, ""He said he believed Turner felt genuine remorse."" But then he also acknowledged that the victim didn't think Turner acknowledged what he'd done. ""In essence, [Judge Persky] said the defendant doesn’t have to agree with the verdict to feel truly sorry,"" Svrluga pointed out. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/743224074063720448] This can only further undermine the judge's decision. Persky was already under fire for saying that a longer prison sentence ""would have a severe impact"" on Turner. He gave the former Stanford student six months in county jail even though the DA had asked for six years in state prison. The victim described her experience in a letter which went viral. ""I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt,"" she wrote, explaining why she thought such a lenient sentence was a mistake. She said that the judge ""should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error."" On Tuesday, a letter was published from a juror which accused the judge of disregarding the jury's convictions in the case. ""It seems to me that you really did not accept the jury's findings. We were unanimous in our finding of the defendant's guilt and our verdicts were marginalized based on your own personal opinion,"" he wrote in a letter to Judge Persky which was published in the Palo Alto Weekly. Given the the contents of this transcript, it would seem the juror is dead right. More than a million people have signed petitions to recall Judge Persky, but signatures need to be collected in Sara Clara County to do so.","""I mean, I take him at his word that, subjectively, that's his version of events.

For the study, Arnaud Legout and co-authors collected two data sets: "" the first, on all tweets containing Bit.ly-shortened links to five major news sources during a one-month period last summer; the second, on all of the clicks attached to that set of shortened links, as logged by Bit.ly, during the same period. After cleaning and collating that data, the researchers basically found themselves with a map to how news goes viral on Twitter. The map showed ""viral"" news is widely shared but not necessarily read. According to the Washington Post, one thing study authors say is concerning about this is that it shapes the way we see the world. Legout said in a statement: "" ""People are more willing to share an article than read it. This is typical of modern information consumption. People form an opinion based on a summary, or a summary of summaries, without making the effort to go deeper."" This probably won’t shock most people.

607,"He Burns Coffee Grounds in His Backyard. The Reason? Genius! Mosquitos suck. Literally. They can turn the most relaxed of backyard barbecues into a frenzy of swatting and knee-slapping. And then there are allergies and serious viruses like Zika that can be transmitted by the annoying little buggers. But you know what sucks even more than mosquitos? Some of the commercial repellants that’ll suck your wallet empty over the summer season, especially if you’re the outdoorsy type. Commercial repellants also tend to havemore than a few harmful effects that arise from breathing them in. The solution? Believe it or not, coffee grounds! The Environmental Protection Agency says coffee grounds work as a very effective natural repellant that will keep many insects – including mosquitos, wasps and bees – away. Many insects have a very strong sense of smell, and coffee grounds, which are incredibly strong-smelling when they burn, drive them crazy. So how do you use them? Easy! Take your used or fresh coffee grounds, put them in a bowl and cover it with aluminum foil. Leave this bowl in a dark, cool place  and let the grounds dry completely.

If you’re using this method at an outdoor gathering, just leave the bowl burning in a central place. Still too many mosquitos plaguing you? Add some fresh bay leaf to the coffee grounds and burn them together.

609,"It's official. Gloria Steinem has weighed in on Miley Cyrus-gate, so we can all go home and stop talking about it forever. Last week, during the Women's Media Awards, Steinem was asked by Yahoo's Omg! Insider whether she thought Cyrus' risque VMAs performance and ""Wrecking Ball"" video were setting the feminist movement back. The icon and activist answered with a resounding ""I don't think so."" She expanded on that opinion, saying: I wish we didn’t have to be nude to be noticed ... But given the game as it exists, women make decisions. For instance, the Miss America contest is in all of its states ... the single greatest source of scholarship money for women in the United States. If a contest based only on appearance was the single greatest source of scholarship money for men, we would be saying, ""This is why China wins."" You know? It’s ridiculous. But that’s the way the culture is. I think that we need to change the culture, not blame the people that are playing the only game that exists. We're glad that Steinem sees the complex context of Cyrus' manufactured sexuality, and didn't resort to shaming the 20-year-old pop star. But we're even more glad to see Steinem's comment as the last word on the matter.","I wish we didn’t have to be nude to be noticed ... But given the game as it exists, women make decisions."
611,"First of all, understand this: In measuring subway ridership on a given day, Metro can’t tell precisely how many people it carried. The transit agency doesn’t record names or create passenger manifests. It merely counts heads electronically — very often the same heads multiple times — and tallies ridership not in terms of individuals, but by ""passenger trips."" So when Metro says that during Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington, subway ridership for the day and evening totaled ""1,001,613 entries"" — the second biggest daily volume in Metro’s 40-year history — it didn’t mean that 1,001,613 people used the rail system. Assuming that a vast majority of the 1,001,613 ""entries"" were made by riders who later entered the subway again, to get back to where they came from, it’s virtually certain that the number of people who used the system during its 19 hours of operation Saturday was closer to a half-million. Saturday’s entries were exceeded only by the 1.1 million entries recorded Jan. 20, 2009, on President Barack Obama’s first Inauguration Day, Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a statement Sunday. By contrast, Metro said, subway entries Friday, during President Trump’s inauguration, totaled 570,557 in a 20-hour period, from the system’s 4 a.m. opening until it closed at midnight. Friday’s ridership also was lower than that of a typical weekday and lower than it was during Obama’s second inaugural, in 2013, when the Metro recorded 782,000 subway trips. ""Over the two days of Friday and Saturday,"" Wiedefeld said, ""Metro trains, buses and paratransit served well over 2 million passenger trips. ... We can all feel proud of providing safe, reliable service for large numbers of riders over two consecutive days on a world stage. This success is especially impressive given the monumental challenge of sustaining such an operation over back-to-back days, along with the logistical challenges that come from national special security events."" In light of the subway’s troubled history of breakdowns and other service-related problems in recent years, the system operated efficiently over the busy weekend.  ""I am so proud of what our team accomplished,"" Wiedefeld said. ""We demonstrated to the region and riders from across the nation that we are capable of delivering world-class service.""","vast majority of the 1,001,613 ""entries"" were made by riders who later entered the subway again"

615,"For most of my life, I’ve thought of quiche as frittata with crust—which is to say savory egg pie. Since frittata is incredibly easy and delicious, and pie crust is not an exciting pastry, I’ve generally made lots and lots of frittatas and not very many quiches. But a few months ago, I discovered how very wrong I was about quiche when Slate’s chairman brought me a square of caramelized-onion quiche from his new favorite bakery, Arcade Bakery in Tribeca. It tasted nothing like a frittata: Instead of being eggy and sturdy, the filling was moist and creamy to the point of silkiness. It was simultaneously light—the filling practically dissolved on my tongue—and rich, like a triple-crème brie or an over-the-top chocolate mousse. As I luxuriated in each bite at my desk in the middle of Slate’s open-plan office, I resented that my surroundings were unworthy of this gastronomic experience—this was a quiche worthy of a picnic in Provence, or at least an intimate dinner party. Eager to learn the key to this delicacy, I reached out to Roger Gural, the owner of Arcade Bakery, to ask for his recipe, which he kindly shared. His approach is unusual in some ways—for instance, he adds yeast to his pie dough, which gives it a breadier exterior and a more interesting flavor than traditional pâte brisée. But the secret to Gural’s amazing quiche isn’t really a secret at all: It turns out quiche isn’t primarily an egg dish; it’s primarily a cream and milk dish. Quiche filling should contain just enough eggs to prevent it from being soupy, but the eggs are (literally) a supporting player. It’s the butterfat in the cream and milk that is responsible for a good quiche’s disarmingly rich texture. In other words: Quiche isn’t frittata with crust; it’s savory custard with crust. (This is why it needs a crust—without it, the custard would fall apart and look gross when you tried to serve it.) The recipe below is lightly adapted from Gural’s; some proportions changed ever so slightly in the transition from metric to conventional American measurements, and I used a standard round pie plate instead of Arcade Bakery’s rectangular mold. I also streamlined the crust, but if you don’t have the time to wait for a yeasted dough to rise, you can substitute a standard pie crust. You can also skip the caramelized onions to save time, or substitute other fillings, as long as they’re fairly dry—excess liquid will ruin the filling’s texture, which is, after all, the most important part. Caramelized Onion Quiche Adapted from Arcade Bakery Yield: 6 to 8 servings Time: 21⁄2 to 41⁄2 hours, largely unattended 6 tablespoons (3⁄4 stick) cold unsalted butter 2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced Salt and black pepper 11⁄4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the crust 1 tablespoon sugar 1⁄2 teaspoon instant yeast 3 large eggs plus 4 large egg yolks 11⁄4 cups plus 1 tablespoon whole milk 11⁄4 cups heavy cream 1. Put 2 tablespoons (1⁄4 stick) of the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. When the butter melts, add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and dark brown, 1 to 3 hours. 2. Meanwhile, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Stir in 1 of the eggs, 1 tablespoon of the milk, and 2 tablespoons water, and knead with the dough-hook attachment of a stand mixer or by hand until the dough feels smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Cut the remaining 1⁄4 cup (1⁄2 stick) of the butter into 1⁄2-inch pieces, add it to the dough, and continue to knead until the butter is fully incorporated. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, put it in a warm place, and let the dough rise for 1 hour. (At this point you can wrap the dough in foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.) 3. Heat the oven to 350°F. Put the remaining 2 eggs and 4 egg yolks in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the remaining 11⁄4 cups milk, the cream, 3⁄4 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Whisk to combine.","Quiche filling should contain just enough eggs to prevent it from being soupy, but the eggs are (literally) a supporting player.

Button is effectively taking a sabbatical year and having a break from F1, but will still work closely with the team in a development role. He’s not doing a ‘Felipe Massa’ and completely retiring. The 2009 world champion’s new two-year contract with McLaren includes an option to race in 2018, but that would probably only happen if Alonso decided to retire or go elsewhere. So it’s a sabbatical year for now, but the 2016 Abu Dhabi GP could still be his final race. McLaren has described this unusual decision an ""innovative three-driver strategy"" for 2017 and 2018, with Button jumping in if needed next year and the same three drivers in the mix for a 2018 seat. Button’s return could also depend on how well Vandoorne does too. Vandoorne won the GP2 championship last year after a dominant season. But with no space on the grid in 2016 he has been forced to keep his racing skills sharp in the Japanese Super Formula series. However, he did make his F1 debut this year for McLaren at the Bahrain Grand Prix, subbing for the injured Alonso. He impressed and finished 10th to score a point in his first F1 start.

Here’s what he has to say on the announcement: ""I’m delighted that I’ll be staying on as a key member of the McLaren-Honda team. In fact I’m massively excited about my new role, which has come about as a result of a number of in-depth chats with Ron [Dennis]. ""I love McLaren-Honda – I firmly believe it’s made up of the best bunch of people I’ve ever worked with – and I have no intention of ever driving for another Formula 1 team. To be clear, I’m very definitely not retiring. I’m contracted for both 2017 and 2018, I intend to work hard on car-development, and I’m sure I’ll get behind the wheel of the new car at some point.""","Jenson Button won’t race in F1 next year, taking on roles as an ambassador and reserve driver for McLaren, but he could return to the F1 grid in 2018."
617,"How To Spectate in Overwatch We all know you prefer to watch than to actually play Overwatch. Here's how you can spectate in Overwatch. As fun as it is to play Overwatch, sometimes players would prefer to kick back and watch their friends, streamers, or eSports figure in order to learn some new tricks, or just be amazed at what can be done in the game. Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn’t make it easy to spectate someone else’s game, so we’re here to give you some tips on how you can watch others play Overwatch. I Like To Watch Considering it’s an online multiplayer game, it’s surprising to see at its launch lacks a dedicated spectator mode. But Blizzard does make it possible to spectate in Overwatch, although it isn’t as convenient as a dedicated spectator mode. One way to spectate a game is to attempt to join a game a friend is currently playing. If the game is full, you’ll be forced to sit on the sidelines, but as a result, you can spectate your friend as well as all of the other players in the match. If your friend continues with the same group into another match, and there’s no vacancies, you’ll continue to sit in the new game as a spectator. Another way to spectate a game is by joining a new game yourself which also has all team spots filled. When this happens, you’ll be forced to enter spectator mode, although as soon as a spot frees up, you’ll be thrown into the action. Unfortunately, there’s no way to back out of the game to re-enter spectator mode. I’ve Got My Eye On You As we mentioned, Overwatch currently doesn’t have a spectator mode, but that doesn’t mean Blizzard won’t consider adding it some time during the game’s post launch. We’ve seen several Blizzard games launch without a dedicated spectator mode, to then have one added months later. So for now, it appears the only way to spectate any matches are the two ways we mentioned above. Need more help with Overwatch?

623,"Throughout the year, kitesurfers in need of an adrenaline rush travel the globe to glide on the waters of the Dakhla lagoon in Western Sahara. It is a unique seaside treat which the Moroccan government has turned into a touristic mirage, writes Camille Lavoix. Some see it as Morocco reinforcing its hold on the region claimed by the Sahrawi people, an indigenous Berber ethnic group, over the past 40 years. For others, the kitesurfing oasis is the best example of Morocco's efforts to develop the disputed territory. However, there is now a renewed risk of conflict in the region. Flights always land in Dakhla at night. You can barely see the oasis in the middle of the desert. In the shadows, the dunes separate the lagoon from the Atlantic Ocean. Every day a plane disgorges a new wave of tourists. With sunglasses on their heads, the passengers push their wind and surf boards into the hotels' 4x4s. Some tourists might notice the numerous military convoys and the checkpoints dotted along the route. But the majority do not imagine they are about to travel near a 2,700 km (1,700-mile) wall separating hostile forces which are just 120 metres apart. It is guarded by 120,000 Moroccan soldiers and packed with anti-personnel mines. The day after their arrival, the tourists wake up in a small paradise in the middle of Western Sahara. Listed by the United Nations as a Non-Self-Governing Territory, the former Spanish colony has been bound to hold a referendum on independence since a UN-brokered truce in 1991. Profile: Western Sahara Meanwhile tourism is booming. ""I think I can hear the sound of the waves,"" said 19-year-old tourist Jules, who had difficulty sleeping on his first night here. But it is actually the sound of the powerful wind which blows for more than 300 days a year, much to the kitesurfers' delight. Ten years ago, Jules' father was one of the first visitors to set up his tent on this unexposed spot. Since then, the desert has seen kitesurfing traffic jams, especially during the high season between April and November. Richard Branson's Virgin group sponsored the 2015 Kitesurfing World Cup series with Dakhla hosting the opening event. For King Mohammed IV of Morocco, this spot is not merely a tourist attraction but is an ambitious project that can foster development and unity. ""This province has potential in terms of security, stability and infrastructures which allows it to become integrated in the economic cooperation at a continental level,"" he said recently. Major investments have undoubtedly been made in the region which can today welcome tourists. Some hotel owners agree with the king's assertion that the ""conflict is an artificial one"". Dakla Evasion Hotel owner Ghali is a Sahrawi but he is ""happy [with] the Moroccan administration"". ""Not all Sahrawi disagree with the Moroccan government. A lot, like me, feel free and do not want to be independent,"" he said. ""Of course, this touristic spot is in a conservative country, it is normal that politics and religion are touchy but it is safe and open."" But others beg to differ - they believe the site is not safe enough for the many tourists who throng the desert resort. ""It is an illusion, a strategy; people die over there. I have seen a child with a missing foot. He played too close to the wall,"" said French MP Herve Feron. The legislator from the Parti Socialiste, which forms France's government, realised the influence Morocco was trying to exert on Western Sahara when he decided to film a documentary on the culture of the Sahrawi people. He described it as a ""soft power Morocco tries to impose"", explaining that activists loyal to the North African country had tried to prove how ""normal"" the territory was by showing him photos of tourists kitesurfing. He was also quick to chastise other politicians he claimed have looked the other way after receiving favours from the Moroccan government. ""I have been invited by the Moroccan consulate but it would make no sense to go to idyllic resorts. Since most politicians accept the invite, they stay quiet and take a coward's stance on Western Sahara."" Abdellahi lbikam, 28, used to be a kitesurfing instructor in Dakhla. ""I was born there and tried to open my own business but I never received the authorisation from the Moroccan authorities,"" he said. ""I fled the country because in 2013, I talked to an Irish journalist and consequently was fired from my job. Then my cousin died in jail in 2014, he was sick and no-one took him to the hospital. I was afraid for my life and asked for asylum in France."" Living in Paris now, Mr Ibikam speaks freely about the ""marginalisation"" he suffered. ""Lots of qualified Sahrawis are not hired anywhere,"" he lamented. ""If the Moroccans want to organise sport and touristic events, let it be, but we would like to be able to work there too. There are only two Sahrawi kitesurfing teachers left."" One Sahrawi, who did not want his name to be used, said he had to set up on his own, offering private lessons to tourists. ""Hotels would not hire me; the only one which did paid me only €200 ($210; £170) a month for an extremely physical job,"" he said. ""But I am not resentful towards the Moroccan people. Many of them are my friends and also struggle to make a living. ""I know it's a government problem, a politician's story. Every time I can, I explain the situation to tourists whom I teach. It is my way to be free."" Amnesty International has expressed concern over the fact that neither the Moroccan government nor the Polisario Front allows outside observers to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the disputed region and refugee camps respectively. ""The population lives under the daily threat of suffering abuses at the hands of the Moroccan authorities and of the Polisario,"" the rights group said. The Spanish authorities have reopened a case against new Polisario leader Brahim Ghali, who has been charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. Eleven Moroccans are also facing the same charges. In September, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary General, Stephane Dujarric, warned that ""any resumption of hostilities, with the potential to have wider regional implications, remains of significant concern"". Soldiers belonging to both sides are stationed ""approximately 120m"" apart. UN chief Ban Ki-Moon also expressed his ""deep concern"" over the situation. Since April 2016, some 146 journalists and activists have been arrested or expelled for reporting on the conflict. The tension between the two sides has, however, not prevented kitesurfers from seeking adventure at the disputed location, while hotels continue to earn good profits.",kitesurfers in need of an adrenaline rush travel the globe to glide on the waters of the Dakhla lagoon in Western Sahara

However, one guy has developed an interesting homemade improvisation to this problem. Akinori Suzuki tweeted an image showing how he managed to ease his MacBook Pro’s overheating troubles by lining up 10 yen coins along the top of the laptop. He explained that the copper coins are able to dissipate the heat. The 10 yen coin is a particularly good coin to use as it is composed of about 95 percent copper. Suzuki argues it work as copper has high thermal conductivity, which allows for a faster transfer of heat away from the computer’s plastic casing. However, many coins that we think are copper actually have very little copper in them nowadays. For Brits, the best bet is a £1 coin – which is comprised of 70 percent copper. One and 2 pence coins won’t do much, as these have merely copper-plating. In Australia, perhaps where this trick will be most useful, all of their coins have high copper content, especially the 1 cent and 2 cent coins. As for the United States, quarters, nickels and, $1 coins are your best bet. As you can see from someone else’s novel design, this can also be applied to desktop computer towers.",copper coins are able to dissipate the heat
633,"A high school junior was refused lunch at the school cafeteria because he owed just shy of $5 for previous school lunches. When high school junior Dominic Grant got his lunch at the school cafeteria, he could not have expected something so humiliating to happen to him. Immediately after getting his food tray, a seemingly angry cafeteria lady rushed towards him, took his tray and threw it in the bin. What was the reason for throwing away perfectly good food? Apparently, Dominic had $5 of unpaid cafeteria debt for previous school lunches. He was left humiliated and all of his school friends saw it. ""It was really embarrassing,"" he told CNN. ""Right in front of the whole lunch room, they took my plate away and said I didn’t have enough to eat today."" When his mother, Amanda Keown, heard that her son’s lunch had been taken away from him because he owed the school less than $5, she was flabbergasted. There have been previous cases where lunch ladies in school cafeterias would get fired over giving food to hungry students who couldn’t afford it, but none like what happened to her son. It’s an issue that plagues schools all across the United States. Keown could not understand how the school could prioritize money over the students’ well-being. So, what did Keown do? Well, she went down to the school and left everyone in awe when she paid her son’s and every other student’s cafeteria debt. It took $200 to settle everyone’s account and saved a lot of students from potentially humiliating treatment by the cafeteria staff. She said she did it because she did not want any other kid going through what her son went through. If only the school shared her views, then the school would be a much more pleasant place for students. ""I was appalled that he was denied lunch and his lunch was taken out of his hands over $5,"" she said. ""I realize that I didn’t have to do that, but I don’t want another kid going through what my son went through."" The school’s treatment of Grant was just appalling. There’s a clear distinction between letting a student know that his tab had accumulated quite a lot of debt and outright humiliating them in front of the other students. Even if he owed more than just $5, the school should not have behaved in such a way, and the people who advocate such behaviour are not fit to run a school. Hopefully, Grant’s story will bring some attention to this issue, which is present in many of the schools throughout the United States.",paid her son’s and every other student’s cafeteria debt

641,"You use it in your coffee every morning, or at least you know someone who does. It's a fixture in your daily routine and at diners across the country. We're talking, of course, about half and half. You may see it everywhere, but do you know exactly what half and half is? Allow us to take the embarrassing fall and ask the question so you don't have to: What the f*ck is half and half? We know it's half of something and half of something else, but what are these two, mysterious halves? Of course, the two halves in half and half aren't mysterious at all. Half and half is simply half whole milk and half cream. In the UK, they call it half cream. According The Kitchn, half and half typically has a 10 to 12 percent fat content, which, it stands to reason, means it's less fatty than cream and fattier than milk. You don't need to wait for your morning coffee for this all to make sense. Half and half isn't just for coffee, either. It's great for cooking, whether you want something creamy but not too heavy, or when your recipes call for both milk and cream. The Kitchn suggests you use half and half for ice cream, chocolate ganache, scrambled eggs, or cream sauce. If you add half and half to a deglazed pan, you'll end up with a rich and flavorful sauce for everything from pasta to chicken. Finally, The Kitchen suggests using half and half for White Russians, if drinking a glass full of cream with your vodka doesn't really appeal. You can add it to oatmeal, whip it into mashed potatoes, and even make a crème brûlée with half and half. The one thing you can't use it for is whipped cream, because the fat content isn't high enough. Outside the U.S., half and half might also refer to something that doesn't have anything to do with milk or cream. In Ireland it might refer to a drink made of Guinness and Harp Lager, and in Brussels it might mean a mixture of Champagne and white wine. Don't worry: the little containers you see everywhere in America, on deli counters and in coffee shops across the nation, contain no alcohol. You'll have to add Bailey's to your coffee for that.",Half and half is simply half whole milk and half cream

645,"This hidden trick allows you to use incense in Pokemon Go more effectively In Pokemon Go, incense is used to tempt Pokemon to the location of the trainer from their general location. Players are generally seen using incense whenever they are at home, work or any other place where they are unable to take a stroll in search of Pokemon. However, a Redditor called __isitin__ has discovered that the coding of Pokemon Go doesn’t help the players much who uses incense without any movement. Generally, incense spawns a Pokemon every five minutes when the players are not making any movement. This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn. At that rate, the players will need to cover one kilometer in five minutes to get the maximum out of the Incense. The players will actually need to jog at a speed of 12 kilometer per hour to meet this target. Although on paper they should be able to collect 30 Pokemon while travelling at this speed using incense, the server and the faulty tracking system of the game will reduce it to 10-15, which is also a good number. So, it is advisable for players not to use the incense while sitting down or not making any movement. Incense is a rare item and the players will receive it for free only while leveling up, and therefore it makes more sense to use it along with the tips mentioned above to get far better results with your Pokemon catching escapades.","This spawning rate, however, can be increased to one per minute if the players manages to move 200 meters in between every spawn."

Love-Robinson was arrested Friday, Sept. 9, 2016 and charged with identity theft and other fraud offenses after he attempted to purchase a Jaguar at a car dealership, Stafford County Sheriff’s officials say. (Photo: Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department / AP file photo) Stafford, Va. — A Florida teenager accused of pretending to be a doctor and stealing money from an 86-year-old patient faces new charges in Virginia after authorities say he fraudulently tried to buy a luxury car. Malachi Love-Robinson was arrested Friday and charged with identity theft and other fraud offenses after he attempted to purchase a Jaguar at a car dealership, Stafford County Sheriff’s officials say. They said employees at Kargar Motors Car Dealership became suspicious when Love-Robinson applied for a car loan with an elderly woman as the co-signer on the loan. The employees called the sheriff’s office after looking up Love-Robinson’s name in an internet search. Deputies came to the car dealership and spoke with Love-Robinson, who said he came to Virginia to buy a car for himself and another for his godmother. The woman, who was not identified, later told deputies that she had not given Love-Robinson permission to be listed as a co-signer on the loan. She also told police she was unaware of recent purchases made on her credit card for two iPads. The sheriff’s office says deputies seized the iPads when they arrested Love-Robinson. Sheriff’s officials say they are still investigating, and Love-Robinson is being held in the Rappahannock Regional Jail. Love-Robinson was arrested in February after law enforcement officials in Florida said he was practicing medicine without a license. Authorities in Palm Beach County said Love-Robinson was illegally operating a medical practice — complete with an office, a lab coat and stethoscope — but had no license to do so. In one instance, they said he went to a woman’s house five times after she contacted him online to treat her for stomach pains. He told her she suffered from arthritis and sold her vitamins, charging her $3,494 that she paid by check. Love-Robinson has denied the charges, saying he never said he was a medical doctor. He claims to have a doctorate from the Universal Life Church, which sells them online for $29.95. His trial on charges of practicing medicine without a license has been delayed until November while his attorney considers a possible insanity defense, according to media reports.",Florida teen accused of pretending to be a doctor and stealing money from an 86-year-old patient

656,"We asked three experts for all the precautions you should take before mouth-to-butt contact happens. Q: I have a partner who is infinitely giving in the sack. He rocks my socks off. He's always so busy doing things to/for me that I get too distracted to do much for him. I would love to change this. One thing he's mentioned once or twice is that he'd like a rim job. In theory I would love to do this if it would give him as much pleasure as he has given me, but I have a few hesitations. Namely, if it is safe/healthy to do this without a barrier. We are monogamous and I'm on the Pill so we don't otherwise use condoms or dental dams for any bedroom activities. My googling turns up many different answers from sexperts and normal people, and I don't know how to separate the information wheat from the chaff. The more cautious sources indicate that one should use a dental dam (with some lube on the receiver's side of the dam). Many other sources act like this is an unnecessarily uptight precaution and having a basically clean body is good enough. I'm not able to discern if the idea of using a dental dam in this scenario is like the recommendation to use a dental dam for cunnilingus or a condom for fellatio, i.e., if it's what ""they"" should say to give you safer sex information, but in reality many monogamous couples who have been tested for STIs are unlikely to use these and they will (usually) be OK. In a nutshell, my question is this: Is it reasonably safe to perform unprotected analingus on someone (with whom you are monogamous) who is not experiencing intestinal distress and has showered that day? Or is there always a greater risk for some kind of illness from gastrointestinal bacteria and one should always use a barrier? Signed, Would Like to Please Hi, Would Like to Please! Thanks so much for your question. To help answer it, we checked in with a few experts from various fields, including: New York City sex therapist Dr. Stephen Snyder, proctologist Dr. David Rosenfeld, and Dr. Dennis Fortenberry, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, who specializes in the research of health risk behaviors and STDs. Here's what they had to say: Actually, analingus (or rim jobs, rimming, oral anal, tossing salad... whichever term you’d prefer) is reasonably safe to perform without a barrier method — at least in your VERY specific circumstances. First of all, kudos for putting so much thought into this request. It's awesome that you're looking for ways to ~give back~ to your partner and that you want to make sure you're both being super safe. You guys are like the model for healthy experimenting in a consensual, monogamous relationship. Seriously, you rock. Anyways... Now, we're not saying that rim jobs are totally without risk, but if you're taking the right precautions you should be able to perform unprotected analingus on your partner and be confident that you're being as safe as possible, says Snyder. Here are the major things to keep in mind: STIs can definitely be transmitted via rim jobs, so make sure you’ve both been tested recently. Pretty much every STI can be passed along this way. ""Not necessarily because the anus or rectum is infected, but because it's part of the skin that connects the entire genital area, and some of those organisms may simply be moving around,"" says Fortenberry. Hypothetically, this could be one way to spread chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, herpes, syphilis, and even HIV. That said, it's also possible to spread these through unprotected oral sex and penetrative sex, which you said you've been doing. ""I'm not sure that the exposure that you would get from direct contact with the anus would be that much different than with oral sex or sex,"" Fortenberry says. Hepatitis A and B can also be transmitted this way, so be sure that you've both been vaccinated, says Snyder. If you haven't been — or you're not sure — you can also get tested and vaccinated as an adult. So as long as you've both recently been tested for STIs, you've both gotten your hepatitis vaccines, and you're both completely monogamous, you shouldn't have to worry about this stuff. OK, so there’s obviously bacteria down there — but it's maybe not as bad as you think. For most healthy people with normal bowel habits, the bacteria down there wouldn't be much of an issue, says Rosenfeld. Important: This is considering that neither of you have any strains of harmful illness-causing bacteria or parasites. More on that later! Basically there's bacteria everywhere — in your anus, in your genitals, in your mouth — and getting this run-of-the-mill bacteria in your mouth wouldn't typically do much damage, Rosenfeld says. In fact, bacteria from the anus could actually do more damage in your vagina than in your mouth, since it can lead to a UTI there. (That's why you should never go from anal penetration to vaginal penetration without changing the condom or washing up.) Interestingly, it's less likely for men to get UTIs this way, but still, it's a good idea to perform oral sex on his penis before you move to his anus (rather than the other way around), says Rosenfeld. BUT if there’s any chance your partner might be sick or experiencing any gastrointestinal distress, skip it. If your partner could have any bacteria that can potentially spread an infection through the fecal oral route (like salmonella, E. coli, C. difficile, etc.) or any parasites (maybe from a recent trip abroad), that can make rim jobs VERY risky. While most people would know if they had a bug like this (because they would feel either a little or A LOT sick), some might just think their stomach was being weird. So if there's any chance your partner might have something like this, don't perform it without a safe barrier method like a dental dam or a condom cut in half. Also, you probably want to talk about his poop habits before you go down there without a barrier. Even just irregular bowel movements could pose a risk for rimming, like if their stool hasn't been totally solid, they're going more or less frequently, or they've had some anal itching lately. These could all be signs that they're not having normal bowel movements, which could mean extra bacteria left hanging around the anus, says Rosenfeld. The goal would be smooth, solid stool that doesn't leave anything behind when you wipe, he explains. That's a sign it's essentially pretty clean back there and you would just need to do some normal washing to make sure there's no lingering germs. (If that's not the case, he'll probably want to check with his doctor about what he can do to become more regular.) Obviously, this means you and your partner should have a conversation about his poops if you want to do this without a barrier method. Hey, it's better than going in there blind, right? He should be really, really clean down there. Like, really clean. Washing with a detachable shower head would be best, but just water and a gentle washcloth should do the trick, says Rosenfeld. Body washes can actually be very irritating on the anus, but if it doesn't cause him any irritation and you both prefer it, you can use a gentle soap. As far as knowing how clean is clean enough, that might be a judgment call. Again, make sure to take everything we've said into consideration here: his STI status, his health, his bathroom habits, etc. Then, if it passes a visual test and a sniff test, you should be in the clear, says Snyder. But no matter what, only do what you’re comfortable with. Obviously there's nothing wrong with using a barrier method while rimming if that makes you more comfortable. Just like using a condom during sex, knowing you have that extra protection can sometimes make you feel more liberated and less inhibited. So if that's the case, you can place a dental dam or a cut-in-half condom on your partner's anus (with some lube on the side that touches him). You can also ease your way into butt play by first blowing warm air on the area or using your fingers and some lube, suggests Snyder. There are tons of nerve endings around there, so just go slow and ask your partner to tell you what feels good. And if you both want to try it without a barrier, make sure to have a conversation about it first, because we talked about a lot of precautions that you'll want to keep in mind. The important thing to remember is that it's reasonably safe under the specific circumstances we discussed above, but it's not entirely without risk. Also, you still want to make sure there's a high degree of trust and communication between you and your partner. ""No sex act is 100% risk-free,"" says Snyder. ""So make sure it's in the context of a trusting relationship where you can rely on the other's honesty.""",reasonably safe to perform without a barrier method

And why do partners sometimes feel the need to cheat? When it comes to infidelity, the reasons vary for men and women. In fact, gender often plays some role in what led to the indiscretion. For example, one reason men often stray is because they don’t feel respected by their partner. In a recent conversation with The Cheat Sheet, Lesli Doares, couples consultant and author oftold us cheating among women is often due to unmet emotional needs. To learn more about infidelity among both men and women, The Cheat Sheet spoke with psychologist Dr. Jeanette Raymond. Her answers to our questions might surprise you. The Cheat Sheet: Despite the common belief that men tend to be cheaters, is it a possibility that women are more likely to cheat than men? Dr. Jeanette Raymond: Absolutely. Women who have outgrown their dependency on their partners often cheat just for the exhilaration of being free and in control of their lives. They don’t want to rock the boat too much, nor do they want to feel trapped and forced to restrict themselves to a narrow lifestyle. Cheating is a great way of having that balance.

With the considerable press about various designers refusing to outfit the new first lady, the glamorous custom ivory gown was the subject of much media attention. Pierre, though, thoroughly supports the first lady and, as he revealed in his first interview since Jan. 21, he’s also incredibly grateful for the opportunity. Additionally, working with her has seemed to only help his career. ""I had no idea when I made the dress what the consequences would be,"" Pierre told Bazaar.com on his newfound celeb status. ""Immediately my phone went completely ballistic with interview requests; I had investors and bankers in Dubai calling, people opened fake Instagram accounts under my name. Even Target called to say, ‘We are so excited you are doing a line for us.’ I’m like, ‘Well, I had no idea I was doing one.’ The attention is something I’m not used to."" Originally approached by Melania Trump to be her stylist for the event, the first lady then asked the designer to create the dress with her help after seeing a number of his sketches, according to Bazaar.com. Throughout the design process, Pierre shared that the incoming first lady was intent on making a dress that was completely her own. ""She was very specific about the neckline, about all the lines being parallel. It was important for us not to follow any recipe for a ‘first lady gown.'"" Melania was even particular about the small details, with Pierre sharing that she once told him, ""Hervé, I love you, but I cannot move my arm to hold my husband’s arm when we dance."" This outspoken attitude during the design process helped Pierre better understand what the first lady was looking for, he said. ""As a man designing for a woman, you put into the clothing your ideals, what you idolize, but a woman will put you back on track and say, ‘I cannot reach my fork,’"" he said. Pierre has nothing but positive feedback to report about his time dressing the first lady, sharing that she already possesses a deep understanding of the fashion industry. ""She knows fashion — she was a model and has worked in a design studio — so she knows about construction,"" he said. ""When I brought her fabric swatches, she immediately picked the heaviest, most beautiful six-ply silk from Italy. She knows about fabrics. It was a very organic conversation, because we have the same vocabulary."" The former creative director at Carolina Herrera has worked with the first lady in the past. In fact, he has fond memories of helping her find pieces during his time at the fashion house. ""I remember when she used to come to the Herrera offices — when she was pleased with the clothes, she would scream with happiness,"" he shared. When questioned about how he would respond to the designers who voiced their disinterest in dressing the first lady, Pierre offered a thoughtful response. ""That’s the good thing about this country: we are all equal, but we are definitely not the same,"" he told Bazaar.com. ""I’m not doing politics, I’m doing dresses. We are not suddenly brokering a big deal between China and Russia. If people don’t want to dress her, I think it’s sad, but I was honored. I don’t criticize these people — it’s their choice, and that’s the beauty of democracy."" Pierre does plan and hope to work with the first lady in the future. As for his predictions for Melania’s fashions in the White House? ""There is an economy of the drawing, and that’s who she is,"" he said. ""Her next four years as first lady are going to be — like this gown — straight to the point, perhaps with a single, measured detail.""",the first lady then asked the designer to create the dress with her help

663,"The adoption of wind and solar for electricity generation around the world is happening at a growing pace, and the likelihood is that it will displace hydrocarbons in fifteen to twenty years (decades sooner than Big Coal, Big Oil and Big Gas expect). Here are some stories illustrating that stepped-up pace. Germany’s wind power output is up by a third in the first five months of 2015 over the same period the previous year. In part, some offshore projects that had been delayed have started coming on line, adding 3 gigawatts of capacity. In part, Germany’s government plans to reduce incentives for wind and has already done so for solar, on the theory that these are now mature industries. The planned changes caused owners of planned wind turbine plants to rush to finish them so as to benefit from the more generous current policies. In 2015, it is expected that for the first time, Germany will generate more electricity via renewables like wind and solar than by its aging set of 8 nuclear reactors. The cost of electricity in Germany is historically low this year as a result of the wind and solar installations in the country, and is half what it is in Britain. China added 5 gigawatts of new solar capacity in the first three months of 2015! That is nearly equivalent to all the solar installations ever built in Spain. China is going for 17 gigawatts of new solar capacity in 2015. That will make it about tied with Germany, currently the leading solar power in the world, with 33 gigawatts of installed coapacity. The state of Maharashtra in India has announced a plan to nearly double its power generation from renewables over the next five years, with plans to have 7.5 gigawatts of solar energy and 5 gigawatts of wind by 2020. At the moment, 9% of the state’s energy comes from renewables,and this plan would bring the total to 15%. The plan is revenue-neutral, in part because of expected help from the Indian federal government. Maharashtra lies on the country’s west coast and includes the mega-city of Mumbai (Bombay), its capital. The state has a population of 114 million, making it more populous than the Philippines and nearly as populous as Mexico. That is, if it were an independent country, it would be no. 12 by population. The state’s annual gross domestic product is $233 billion, putting it in the same neighborhood as Iraq, Chile and the Philippines. Wind power in Brazil doubled in the past year, and solar is up 62%. Brazil is looking to add 6 new gigawatts of electricity generation capacity in 2015. The United Arab Emirates plans to add 100 megawatts of new solar PV capacity soon. By 2017 the largest solar plant in the Middle East will open, with a capacity of 200 megawatts. By 2021, the UAE plans to get 24% of its electricity from renewables. The UAE is a country of about 9 million, though only about 2 million of those are citizens. It has a GDP of about $400 billion annually, mainly income earned from petroleum exports. But Dubai has emerged as a finance hub and the country is diversifying away from oil. Unlike American CEO’s, the Gulf sheikhs are usually not in any doubt about climate change or the likelihood that the globe will have to give up burning hydrocarbons. The UAE is attempting to position itself as a major player in green energy markets via its Masdar corporation. Why is all this happening? Because solar power and wind power are competitive with hydrocarbons even if we don’t figure in externalities. Their real price is rapidly falling. Externalities are things like pollution, which economists often do not figure into their formulas for profitability. If we considered externalities, then coal, gas and oil are worthless because they are so destructive. Burning them is like setting off multiple atomic bombs in the atmosphere. But even if you left a little thing like that out of your equations, solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace. For instance, Dubai let a bid for a new solar PV plant that will generate electricity for only 6 cents a kilowatt hour. It would have cost the UAE more than that to build a natural gas plant. We are only at the beginning of a huge electricity price drop.",solar and wind can now compete with other forms of energy in the global marketplace

670,"Her baby wasn't alone in this mystifying sonogram. Find out why these images fill this mom with joy. Rebecca Melia never got to tell her mom she was pregnant. Melia, 30, was overjoyed to conceive, but just as she began to plan for the new life entering the world, another life was about to exit. At six months pregnant, Melia went to the doctor for a routine ultrasound. That’s when the emotional roller coaster of the past few months really came to a head. At first, the procedure was totally normal. Technicians operated the equipment. They collected the images. Nurses were supposed to bring out the pictures, but there was some sort of delay. Melia started to get nervous. ""They had me there for a long time and I could tell they had seen something on the scan,"" she told the Daily Mail. In fact, they had, but Melia could never have guessed what it was. Melia was beginning to panic. ""I was convinced it was something wrong with my boy,"" she said. After what seemed like an eternity, a nurse emerged from the back room. She had a peculiar smile on her face. Melia peered at the ultrasound image. It showed her healthy baby boy, curled up just like he was supposed to be. It also showed something else, something mysterious and maybe even a bit spooky. In the upper left corner of the image, as if peering down protectively on the infant, there was a human face. Melia immediately recognized her mother. In a strange way, this ultrasound was an answer to Melia’s prayers. She and her seven siblings all agreed that they felt their mother’s presence after she passed, but what Melia truly wanted was to see her mom’s face one more time. Melia felt that her mother was looking down on her. Now she had proof, of a sort. ""I have a little area in my room with pictures of my mum on and before I went for my scan I was talking to her, saying I wish she was coming with me,"" Melia said. ""This is her 14th grandchild and she has been there for every one."" Melia wants to tell the world about her miraculous ultrasound. ""I wanted to share this story to bring comfort to others who have lost their loved ones and show this is proof that loved ones who have died may not be seen, but they are still here,"" she said. It’s a beautiful sentiment, and it’s hard to argue with photographic evidence. Still, there are those who view Melia’s story with skepticism. The main argument that this image is not actually evidence of spiritual intercession but is, instead, purely psychological. Skeptics point to a strange mental phenomenon called pareidolia, in which the human mind resolves unclear images into something familiar, usually a face. Face-like objects spark deeply rooted cognitive processes, allowing people to recognize them instantly. Melia’s ultrasound is actually just the latest in a long string of strange prenatal images. In 2014, a London couple, Jon and Lindsay McHale, went for a 4D scan of their unborn daughter, Madison. They saw something in the scan that they immediately identified as a ""guardian angel."" ""I like to think there is a relative watching over Madison, and we think the face looks a lot like my grandma Kathy,"" Lindsay told the Mirror. The McHales tried to recreate the miracle when Lindsay got pregnant again. But this seems to have been a one-time event. In fact, angels pop up in ultrasounds all the time, if the internet is to be believed. Kelly Lewis, 26, shared a picture of her ultrasound in January 2016. She wanted to offer an uplifting response to an ultrasound image then making the rounds on Reddit, in which a demonic figure seems to stand over a reclining baby. The ultrasound image shows Lewis’ baby in grainy black and white. Above the infant’s stomach, there’s the clear image of an angel, wings and all. Waves of energy seem to pass from the angel’s face toward the baby’s. Lewis reached out to the Mirror to give the image some context. ""It looks just like an angel is leaning over my baby, with a cherub face as well hovering over the baby,"" Lewis said. ""It’s so clear, no one could believe their eyes when they saw it."" About that ""demon"" image, by the way... In 2016, Imgur users were confronted with a much more disturbing picture. Like the others, it showed a healthy infant. Instead of an angel, though, an image that some describe as ""demonic"" stands over the baby. More than a few readers had a theory that would dispel the unpleasant association with an evil creature. ""That’s the Hindu god Ganesha,"" wrote the-electric-monk. ""He’s a wisdom god, and remover of obstacles."" Whether it’s pareidolia or magic, people are fascinated by the figures they perceive in ultrasounds. Skeptics point to the powerful intersection of the mind’s tendency toward pareidolia and the emotional force of pregnancy to discount supernatural interpretations. Strong emotions tend to strengthen the psychological processes behind pareidolia, skeptics argue. When you care deeply for a certain being, whether that’s your unborn child or a religious figure, you’re more likely to look for hidden meanings and miracles surrounding your love object.","In the upper left corner of the image, as if peering down protectively on the infant, there was a human face.

Is six hours enough sleep? originally appeared on Quora the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights Answer by Shawna Curry , Registered Nurse (BN), on Quora : Research indicates that optimal sleep is between seven and nine hours. The caveat on it is the quality of your sleep. If you are getting nine hours of poor quality/interrupted sleep compared to getting six and a half hours of quality/consolidated (all together) sleep, you will potentially perform better with less sleep. Some people do better with a shorter or compressed sleep window because it allows them to have better quality sleep. Some individuals sleep deep and are able to maintain that for longer than nine hours. There is a magic sweet spot that balances quality and quantity that you’ll want to experiment with to find for yourself. Most people try to get away with as little sleep as possible so that they can do other tasks in their day, because pretty much everything trumps sleep. If you start on the lower end and think, ""Wow, I can function great on only four hours of sleep,"" you are likely mistaken. The problem with that type of self-assessment is that we are horrible at being able to assess our own level of functioning. It’s kind of like walking around with the blood alcohol level of a few drinks in your system at all times. When that becomes your ""norm,"" you just get used to it and think you are functioning fine.

678,"I taught myself about orphanages 12 years ago, not actually because of my work as a human biologist but because of my daughter. She was born in 2004 and her first 14 months of life were spent in an orphanage in China. I am well acquainted with the vast body of research that shows the physical and psychological harms of deprived environments. Orphanages can arguably be placed under this category along with other places such as refugee camps and some hospitals where children lack close contact and attention. Deprivation comes in many shapes and forms: lack of food, diseases, maltreatment, and child abuse are some of the harms that come to mind. However, I would argue that deprivation of love can be just as deadly. When I started researching orphanages and child health I read the classic works of paediatrician Harry Bakwin, psychologist John Bowlby and psychiatrist Harry Edelston. At the beginning of the 20th century, in the US and the UK, the death rates among infants placed in orphanages, nurseries, and foundling hospitals were, in some cases, close to 100%. London’s Foundling Museum documents in depth these harsh realities. In the 1940s, the work of psychoanalyst Rene Spitz further documented high infant death rates (one out of three) and, among the babies who didn’t die, high percentages of cognitive, behavioural and psychological disfunction. Most of these deaths were not due to starvation or disease, but to severe emotional and sensorial deprivation – in other words, a lack of love. These babies were fed and medically treated, but they were absolutely deprived of important stimulation, especially touch and affection. The importance of touch Human touch is fundamental for human development and survival. Research conducted by Ruth Feldman and Tiffany Field has shown the positive effects that come from skin-to-skin touch in premature babies and that these effects are still at work after ten years. Significant gains in neurological development, weight gain, and mental development of premature babies have been shown to be triggered by skin-to-skin stimulation. Infants in orphanages can be deprived of touch, individual attention, and love. This happens not because all orphanages are terrible places (although some of them are), but because there are usually too many babies for the staff to manage. In the case of the hospitals, in Europe and the US in the first half of the 20th century, nurses were required to cover their faces with surgical masks and not interact with babies. Parents and other family members were prevented from visiting freely as it was believed this would prevent infections from spreading and help keep babies healthy. However, instead of getting better the babies got worse. Bakwin understood that this was harmful to the children’s well-being. He stated that ""failure of infants to thrive in institutions is due to emotional deprivation"". The term ""failure to thrive"" is currently used as an umbrella term of conditions, ranging from growth delay, emotional misery and death. It is a generalised health problem seen in high-income and low-income countries although it is more prevalent when poverty and a lack of human resources prevents the babies from receiving emotional and sensorial stimulation (or love) on a daily basis. My daughter’s story The reports from our adoption agency guaranteed that the children were well taken care of, fed appropriately, and had toys to play with. But how much sensory stimulation were they given? We knew that the babies were trained, from very early, to hold their feeding bottle on their own. It was not possible to have a carer per child during feeding times. We flew to China and adoption day finally arrived. Our daughter seemed to be in good health. She adapted herself to us quickly, clearly enjoying the attention we provided, and ate everything we offered. However, on the day we held her for the first time, 90% of the baby girls her age were taller than her. The effects of short height at this age can linger for life and are usually associated with poor health in later life, such as a greater risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Once we got her back home, we were certain that love and bonding would be what she needed most. Three months later, 75% of girls her age were taller than her. Today, at 11 years of age, only 50% of girls her age are taller than her. This is consistent with research that shows a catch-up growth for children who were in orphanages and internationally adopted. When emotional deprivation and lack of love occur, physical growth slows down or stops. The body enters into a survival mode where vital, basic physiological functions are preserved at the cost of physical, mental, and social development. The longer the child is in survival mode, the more permanent and negative the effects will be. Once a child is adopted and the amount of love, care, and stimulation increases, the body ceases to be in survival mode and will start recuperating. My husband and I study anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, providing accurate biomedical information on health and nutritional status. We measure our daughter twice a year and compare the results with the World Health Organisation references. But we do not obsess over her measurements. She is a very healthy child, doing well at school in academic subjects, sports, and music. We are now happily bracing for adolescence. Our daughter’s experience mirrors that of thousands of other babies adopted into loving, well-off families. Increasing awareness on this issue is a step in the right direction, so that more orphaned children receive the happy ending my daughter did.

685,"NEW ORLEANS -- LeBron James is growing impatient with the direction the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers appear to be heading and is calling for the franchise to do something about it. After Cleveland's fifth loss in its past seven games -- 124-122 to a New Orleans Pelicans team that was without Anthony Davis on Monday night -- James unloaded on what he believes is a roster ill-equipped, in its current state, to lift the Larry O'Brien Trophy in June. ""I just hope that we're not satisfied as an organization,"" James told a small group of reporters who regularly travel to cover Cleveland's road games. ""I just hope we're not satisfied."" The Cavs broke their city's 52-year championship drought last season, eliminating a Golden State Warriors team that went an NBA-record 73-9 in the regular season. This season, Golden State added former MVP Kevin Durant and veteran big men David West, Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee -- and leads the league with a 38-7 record. James says the Cavs, on the other hand, have regressed. ""We're not better than last year,"" he said, ""from a personnel standpoint."" Cleveland opted against re-signing Matthew Dellavedova and Timofey Mozgov during free agency and waived Dahntay Jones. In their place, the Cavs added rookie point guard Kay Felder, acquired Mike Dunleavy (who has since been shipped out in the Kyle Korver deal) and signed Chris ""Birdman"" Andersen, who went down with a season-ending knee injury. Meanwhile, James listed other free agents -- Raymond Felton, who signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, and Michael Beasley, who was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks -- as players who could have helped the Cavs make it through the regular season. ""It's great to have bodies,"" James said. ""Obviously, in the playoffs, you go down to what, eight max? And if somebody gets in foul trouble, you go to nine. You're not playing back-to-backs. You have two days in between. You're able to lock in."" He contrasted that with the Cavs' schedule this week, which includes five games from Monday to Monday: at New Orleans, home against Sacramento on Wednesday, home against Brooklyn on Friday, home against Oklahoma City on Sunday and in Dallas on Monday. ""It's like when you don't have bodies. It's tough,"" James said. ""The f---ing grind of the regular season. We're a top-heavy team. We have a top-heavy team. We top-heavy as s---. It's me, [Kyrie Irving], [Kevin Love]. It's top-heavy."" As he has done for several weeks, James continued to call for a backup point guard or playmaker to be added to the mix to help lessen the load for him and Irving, in particular. James played 44 minutes against New Orleans, racking up 26 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for his fourth triple-double of the season. Irving played 42 minutes and scored a season-high 49 points. James made it clear that his frustration is not aimed at any one teammate or person in the front office. ""I'm not singling out anybody,"" James said. ""I'm not. Yeah, we won [the championship], but f---, you know what, let's see if we can do something."" He said he has already voiced his thoughts about the roster to general manager David Griffin face-to-face. Realizing how it could look to call for a point guard with Felder and DeAndre Liggins on the roster, James said it would not be fair to expect either of those young players to fill such a significant role on a title-contending team. ""We need a f---ing playmaker,"" James said. ""I'm not saying you can just go find one, like you can go outside and see trees. I didn't say that."" Using Twitter, James clarified his comments on Tuesday. I not mad or upset at management cause Griff and staff have done a great job, I just feel we still need to improve in order to repeat... — LeBron James (@KingJames) January 24, 2017 if that's what we wanna do. — LeBron James (@KingJames) January 24, 2017 There were several motivating factors in James' sounding off. Mo Williams didn't report to training camp, leaving the Cavs without a veteran backup at point guard. J.R. Smith's thumb injury, which could sideline him for several more months, left Cleveland without one of its most reliable two-way players. However, the timing of playing both Golden State and the San Antonio Spurs within a week's time seems to have opened James' eyes even more to the disparity in talent between the Cavs and some of their fiercest championship competition. ""They've got bodies,"" James said of San Antonio when asked about the Spurs' beating the Cavs without Pau Gasol or Tony Parker. ""They've got bodies. For the most part, all championship-contending teams has got guys that are ready to step in. Knock on wood, what if Ky goes down? For two weeks. Let's say two. What if I went down for three weeks?"" A reporter responded to James that many wonder how Cleveland would do if James tapered his minutes at the end of the month, as Cavs coach Ty Lue said was the plan. ""Yeah, y'all are worried about five minutes. What if I went down for two weeks?"" James said. ""Trying to build something, you know?"" Lue was defiant in his postgame remarks, brushing off any concern about the rut the Cavs appear to be in. ""I know what I'm doing, and we're going to be fine,"" Lue said. ""I know what I'm doing. I'm not going to change or not have confidence in what I can do."" James defended Lue for feeling the need to play him and Irving for heavy minutes. ""What else are we going to do?"" James said. ""You saw the game. Kyrie had to do that. And I tried to mix in my plays. We didn't have no choice. ... We got what we got."" James, in his 14th season, said the urgency in beefing up the Cavs' bench comes from the stage of his career. ""I don't know what we got to offer,"" James said. ""I just know me, personally, I don't got no time to waste. I'll be 33 [next] winter, and I ain't got time to waste. That's what I'm talking about."" An earlier statement by James seemed to sum it all up. ""We got to figure it out,"" he said.

We had a great time – and now I’m going to totally contradict myself – we had a great time doing a sequel to Anchorman, and I think Step Brothers would definitely be in that same category. IGN: I suggested having it take place in an old people’s home and he said that’s something you guys have actually kicked around. Ferrell: We actually had kicked that around.

697,"We are at a pivotal moment in society. Particle beam physicist Andrew Yakub was studying societal trends in college when he realized that to advance as a society, we need to improve our energy sources. ""It occurred to me that we’ve hit a point where because of industrial and economic conditions, there hasn’t been an advancement of technology in terms of energy. We’ve been in the age of fossil fuels for the past 250 years ever since the industrial revolution. We got lazy with it. As a result, society is failing to progress to the next level of where we need to be to advance as a society,"" says Andrew. ""We need a sustainable economy; we need energy sources that are clean and renewable. That’s the only way we’ll be able to increase world population and increase the level of human development indexes around the world."" He started looking into photovoltaic electricity, or energy generated from solar cells, and started a company to finance solar installations with government grants. When he heard the grants would be ending in a few years, he decided to find a more economical way to install solar. ""I came across something that was discovered over 30 years ago: a method of cutting silicon without any waste and being able to cut it very thin, significantly thinner. That brought the overall reduction in silicon waste down to a record, which is 100 times less than what the market standard was,"" he says. It’s not just any silicon, but Float Zone silicon, which Andrew explains is 25% more efficient than other types because of its low oxygen content. While it was rarely used in the past because it’s expensive, his technology made it cost-effective. A more efficient type of silicon combined with sleek slicing technology equal a product that’s poised to propel the energy industry towards renewable energy. Andrew founded Rayton Solar to bring the product to market. ""Our technology brings down the cost of everything that’s not the solar panel. Because of the efficiency increase, all the installation, the labor, all those balance of system costs are reduced by 25%, but we also bring the actual module cost down by 60%. We’ve hit the point technologically and economically here where we’re bringing the total cost of the installation of a solar system under a dollar per watt,"" he says. ""Once we brought it under a dollar per watt, it’s competitive with any form of energy, either fossil fuel-based or any other form of energy."" Solar energy has had its critics, mainly saying it can’t compete because of expense. With Andrew’s technology, that criticism evaporates. ""It’s true that solar couldn’t compete ten years ago, but the market has dropped so rapidly over the past couple of years that it’s just right now just above the point where it would be cheaper than conventional forms of energy, and then with the Rayton technology we bring it past that threshold. It’s competitive per kilowatt hour without subsidies,"" says Andrew. Rayton’s solar technology has the power to radically change the way we energize our lives, and Andrew says it could provide a boost to the economy as well. ""It’s the solution to a future for humanity. It provides high tech jobs. It’s what we need to provide a sustainable economy here in the U.S. To make solar panels using the Rayton technology you need a highly educated workforce, and that’s what the U.S. has – you can’t find it cheap overseas – so it’s the thing that could really spur and boost our economy if rapidly developed,"" he says. Out of the many forms of renewable energy, he believes solar is the most promising. According to the International Energy Agency, by the year 2050, solar could be our main source of energy. ""I really see this is as the solution out of all the renewables,"" Andrew says. ""The best thing we could do as a society is to adopt photovoltaics. Photovoltaics has the least if any environmental impact; I don’t know one case against a photovoltaic installation. Also, silicon is the second most abundant element on the planet, so therefore we’ll never run out of it. It’s also nontoxic. I see solar being on everything, every house."" The future is sunny for Rayton; they plan to scale to one gigawatt of production in the next five years – that’s enough for around 750,000 homes, or the equivalent of two coal power plants – and they’ll advance from there.",more efficient type of silicon combined with sleek slicing technology
698,"A vacation away from your email is an entirely different experience, says WSJ Leadership Expert Brian Scudamore. Photo: iStock Photo Brian Scudamore ( @BrianScudamore) is the founder and CEO of O2E Brands, which includes 1-800-GOT-JUNK?. We all know people who go on vacation, only to continue firing off emails and texts as they lie on the beach, neglecting their spouse and kids. As a CEO of four brands, it’s tempting to check in all the time, but I don’t want to be that person. And I sure don’t want to be the boss interfering with my employees’ well-earned breaks. I realized that unless I unplug completely on vacation, I cheat myself out of generating fresh, new, creative ideas. In the long run, business suffers from my burnout. I also think that if our people don’t disconnect, they end up compromising their contributions to our overall mission. More importantly, they fail at what should be their top priority: cherishing time with family and friends, and having work-life balance. So, I’ve devised a rule when I take my annual six-week vacation: I have my assistant change the passwords on my email and social media accounts. I go dark. Nobody from work can reach me – and it’s worth noting that in the eight years I’ve been practicing this digital disappearing act, no one has really needed to reach me. The results have been revolutionary. I come back from vacation super-charged, rested and feeling like I gave my family and friends my best self. Instead of lounging poolside wondering about to-do’s, deals and emails, I’m a million miles away from work – on self-imposed exile from the digital world. Going dark feels surreal at first, and the withdrawal might make you feel antsy. We are a culture (literally) addicted to the little charge we get from checking our social-media accounts. For it to work, you have to develop a culture where everyone unplugs, and partner up with a colleague who’ll have your back while you’re MIA. Mine is our president and COO, Erik Church, who’s in charge of all major decisions while I’m away. When he goes dark, I cover for him. Although getting off the grid is a respected part of our corporate culture, some people are more addicted to their devices than others. Our vice president of communications recently went away, and she finds it really hard to disconnect. Before she left, I pulled up a chair and reminded her that she should go dark on a trip with her husband for his 40th birthday, away from their young kids. She promised she’d resist the urge ... but as a backup, I met with her team to make sure they wouldn’t engage if she pinged them. Their cooperation meant a week of wine tours, brunches and total freedom. It was the first time she’d ever totally disconnected from email and forgot about work. She came back to the office refreshed and convinced that the experience was ""totally worth it."" And it only worked, she added, because she had a team that she could trust. So I challenge you: Go dark this summer. Change your passwords, leave your devices, and check out of the grind. What you’re really doing is acknowledging the capabilities of your team and the systems you have put in place. The hardest part will be accepting that disconnecting will add value to your workplace that will never materialize if you’re constantly plugged in. If you go dark on vacation, you’ll be ready for the light when you return. Read the latest Leadership Report.",have my assistant change the passwords on my email and social media accounts
705,"Even if you don't have a TV in your bedroom, chances are you have Netflix on your laptop. And now that the weather's getting colder, there's probably a good chance that you might curl up under the covers with a flick and a snack of some sort. But just how unsanitary is eating in your bed? We wanted to know, and we wanted you to know, too. Kadi Dulude, the owner of top New York City cleaning service Wizard Of Homes, told HuffPost Home that ""at least half"" of the places she cleans show signs of people eating in their beds. ""Most people know to take their dishes to the sink, but in the extreme cases, it's like their bed is their dining room and if they don't clean up, there are a lot of bugs,"" says Dulude. So what will happen when you leave traces of snacking between the sheets? Paul Bello, exterminator and owner of PJB Pest Management Consulting, told HuffPost Home that bugs will appear when there are crumbs left around. The most common creepy crawlers to show up? Ants and cockroaches. ""The people who are sloppy and don't clean up after themselves are the ones who run the risk,"" says Bello. ""Cockroaches need only a little bit of food to survive."" As you might expect, certain foods attract different types of bugs. According to Lou Sorkin, a forensic entomologist (a person who studies insects) and a senior scientific assistant at the American Museum of Natural History, sweet foods such as soda, fruit juices, cupcakes and cookies with icing could attract ants and certain flies, including house flies, blue bottle flies and green bottle flies. Leftover foods, such as milk from a bowl of cereal, pizza sitting in the box or hamburgers and chicken left out in the takeout container, can attract ants, flies and even cockroaches. Normally, Dulude advises that people wash their sheets every week, but for those who constantly eat in bed, she says every three days would be ideal. When it's all said and done, we suggest heeding Dulude's sage advice when it comes to bedroom practices. ""I would suggest not eating in bed at all,"" she said. ""Just don't put the TV in the bedroom. Keep the bedroom as a sacred place where you go to rest.""","""The people who are sloppy and don't clean up after themselves are the ones who run the risk,"" says Bello.

706,"An elderly woman recently decided to leave her home for a rare outing, but never in her wildest dreams could she have imagine what the day would bring. Maria Vasquez, 93, was accompanied by her caretaker. They stopped at the bank in East Harlem, New York before stopping into a department store so Maria could purchase a pair of comfortable shoes. Maria, who has survived three strokes and lives in public housing, was enjoying her errands, until… Out of nowhere, the security cameras inside Regine’s department store captured a long-haired man coming up behind Maria and reaching straight into her shirt! While Maria sat unaware and bound to her wheelchair, the man proceeded to swiftly grab $600 in social security money out from her bra, where she kept it so it would stay safe. Maria needed that money to pay for food and her monthly bills. By the time Maria realized what had happened, she screamed for help — but the thief had already disappeared out of the store. Word spread fast, and the anonymous robber was quickly dubbed ""the worst person in New York."" Now, it was up to the police department to find out who did this… Maria Vasquez doesn’t get out much, and when she does, she uses a wheelchair to get around. The 93-year-old woman lives in public housing East Harlem, New York. She is a strong woman who has survived three strokes. Recently, Maria’s health aide accompanied her on some mid-week errands. Their first stop was the bank. Maria noticed a young man looking at her while she cashed her check at the bank, but didn’t think much of it at the time. Maria and her caretaker then stopped at Regine’s a nearby department store. She wanted to pick up a new pair of comfy shoes. But suddenly, that same man who Maria saw glancing at her in the bank walked up behind her. He proceeded to grab the $600 in social security money straight from her bra, scratching her chest in the process. The robbery was swift and seamless, but the whole thing was caught on the store’s security camera. Maria desperately needed that money to pay for rent, electricity and food. The second Maria realized the man had stolen from her, she yelled, ""They’re stealing my money! They’re stealing my money!"" But it was too late — the thief ran out of the store. Maria realized he must have followed her to Regine’s after watching her cash her check. Regine’s released surveillance images of the suspect. Two days later, police tracked him down at his home. The 26-year-old Brooklyn man was charged with two counts of robbery, one count of grand larceny and one count of criminal possession of stolen property. Headlines around the city dubbed him ""the worst person in New York."" Here’s where the story takes a truly heartwarming turn. While the city of New York lambasted the thief, Maria was flooded with kindness and support. The owner of Regine’s handed Maria $600 in cash to make up for what she lost. He also gave her the shoes she had intended to buy. Felix Roque, the mayor of West New York, New Jersey presented Maria with a check for $1,000 in donations. ""You hear stories about people hurting people,"" he said. ""This is a story about people helping people, and it feels good."" But the generosity didn’t end there — a stranger set up an online fundraiser that raised $2,000 for Maria — more than triple its goal. Maria says she’s overwhelmed by the show of love and kindness from strangers everywhere. Thankfully, justice has been served. This story proves there are good people in the world.","The 26-year-old Brooklyn man was charged with two counts of robbery, one count of grand larceny and one count of criminal possession of stolen property."

However, in a recent talk, the iconic physicist applied his brilliant mind to a more emotional matter. Hawking gave a poignant message to people suffering from depression, making a poetic comparison between depression and a black hole – no matter how dark they seem, neither are impossible to escape. Hawking said: ""The message of this lecture is that black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. ""Things can get out of a black hole both on the outside and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up – there's a way out."" He gave the speech in front of a crowd of over 400 people on Thursday evening, January 7, as part of the Reith lecture at the Royal Institute in London. The lecture was scheduled for November last year, but had to be postponed due to Hawking’s poor health. Hawking, who turned 74 the day after the lecture, has lived with motor neuron disease for almost 53 years – despite being told he had just two years to live when diagnosed in 1963. Speaking to the same audience, his daughter Lucy noted Hawking’s incredible mental fitness – both intellectually and emotionally. ""He has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going,"" she said.

729,"Archaeologists uncover wonderfully preserved 520-million-year-old fossil. Imagine you are swimming in the cool waters of a calm sea. Beneath the surface lies a field of color revealing itself and dancing in the shifting light. Then suddenly a creature from the depths appears, swimming closer and closer in a frightening blur of spindly legs and gnashing teeth. LOS ANGELES, CA (Catholic Online) - Before you get too frightened, take a breath and relax. The creature has been dead for 520-million-years, leaving you free to swim to your heart's delight. The creature, Chengiangocaris kunmingensis, or simply C. kunmingensis, has long been extinct, but a beautifully preserved fossil of the shrimplike creature's nervous system has been discovered beneath Southern China. Biologist Javier Ortega-Hernández explained C. kunmingensis stuck to the bottom of the sea, where it scooped food into its mouth with a large pair of legs close to its face, sported an armored head, and had a long segmented body with three or four pairs of legs protruding from each one. The fossil was discovered to have a ""ropelike"" central nerve cord that traveled the length of its body and formed nerve clusters in several areas. Researchers noted the masses, called ""ganglia,"" became progressively smaller as the central nerve cord spanned the creature's body. Interestingly, the ganglia each associated with a pair of C. kunmingensis' 80 legs. The complete specimen has been beautifully preserved (Yunnan University). Ortega-Hernández explained C. kunmingensis could grow up to six-inches-long and had ""at least 80 legs! ... ""Our jaws dropped when we put the specimens under the microscope and observed the fine nerves on the sides,"" he gushed. ""It was hard to believe that something so small would be preserved along with the main nerve cord, but even more so because they show a unique organization that is otherwise unknown in living arthropods."" Until the discovery, all researchers knew of the creature had been gleaned from records of bones, teeth, shells and other organic structures since soft tissues like nervous systems and organs deteriorate at a faster rate. Ortega-Hernández believes the specimen had been caught beneath a fine sediment and died in an environment that did not allow oxygen to reach and deteriorate it. ""Eventually the carcasses become preserved in the fossil record, and the limited decay allows for the preservation of amazing morphological detail,"" Ortega-Hernández explained. The findings have been published in the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and images of the fossil are available at the Cambrian Creatures Gallery: Photos of Primitive Sea Life, the Image Gallery: Bizarre Cambrian Creature and the Gallery: Amazing Cambrian Fossils from Canada's Marble Canyon. --- Copyright 2017 - Distributed by THE CALIFORNIA NETWORKThat persecuted Christians may be supported by the prayers and material help of the whole Church.","The creature, Chengiangocaris kunmingensis, or simply C. kunmingensis, has long been extinct, but a beautifully preserved fossil of the shrimplike creature's nervous system has been discovered beneath Southern China."
731,"An analysis of giant panda poop has revealed that when the bears switch to a leafy, less fibrous diet, they slough off the lining of their gastrointestinal tract. It then passes through their digestive system and comes out as a gooey mass. The findings, published in Frontiers in Microbiology this month, may help explain why these endangered animals are struggling to reproduce. Recent work revealed that the digestive systems of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) resemble that of carnivores and omnivorous bears – even though their transition to a vegetarian diet happened some 2 million years ago. Their gut and gut microbes are built for breaking down meat and small amounts of plant matter, yet pandas eat up to a third of their body weight in bamboo every day. A team led by Garret Suen from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ashli Brown of Mississippi State studied two giant pandas living at the Memphis Zoological Society in Tennessee: a female named YaYa and a male named LeLe (pictured above). The team observed the pandas’ bamboo consumption behavior, and they collected fresh feces (pictured to the right) as well as samples of mucous excretion. Pandas undergo dramatic seasonal shifts in diet: Most of the time, they eat bamboo stalks, but in August and September, they shift to leaves. Shortly after this summertime shift from woody stalks to less fibrous leaves, the pandas experience episodes of gastrointestinal tract distress, with symptoms ranging from abdominal pain to the excretion of mucous stools containing gelatinous pellets called mucoids. And the pandas stop eating. After sequencing DNA extracted from stool samples, the team found that microbial diversity is lower in samples collected immediately before mucoid episodes than in the mucoids. Additionally, mucoids contain microbes that are typically found in the gut lining. Together, these findings suggest that mucoids are the expulsion of the internal mucus lining driven by changes in diet. ""What we think might be happening is that their diet is causing a strong internal reaction, leading to an inflammatory response,"" Suen explained in a statement. ""Pandas are basically shedding their gastrointestinal lining to allow for the replacement of those microbes. It’s kind of like resetting the microbiome."" The researchers aren’t sure why pandas experience this resetting, and furthermore, this summer shift in food – and the sickness that follows – coincides with the beginning of panda pregnancies. Mucoids are more prevalent following breeding season, and the reduction in nutrition may affect gestation, lactation, and cub development.

736,"On the very first day of this year, Jan. 1, 2016, a new ""Simpsons"" fan theory emerged that quickly inspired a viral amount of yellow journalism. As the theory goes, famously cranky bartender Moe Szyslak has actually known all along that Bart Simpson is the notorious prank-caller that’s been bothering his bar since the very first season of the show in 1990. The Reddit user that proposed the theory, Senor_Schnarf, argued that Szyslak is simply a family friend of the Simpsons and goes along with Bart’s pranks given he’s a lonely man who enjoys making the kid happy. The most compelling evidence is that Bart’s phone calls to the bar are typically in the same exact voice ― every time ― and follow a beyond obvious joke structure. Szyslak also always goes out of his way to make the joke land. As an example, in the Season 1 episode ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" Bart calls Moe’s bar and asks, ""Hello, is Al there? ... Al. Last name: Coholic."" In that call, Moe could simply ask if there’s a Mr. Coholic or an Al, but instead yells, ""Phone call for Al. Al Coholic. Is there an Al Coholic here?"" The running joke of Bart pranking Moe is one of the show’s most iconic bits. If this theory is true, you would definitely need to go back and re-watch all 27 seasons with the correct interpretations of the two characters to get an accurate understanding of the show. That would take a long time! So with the opportunity to interview Hank Azaria ―the voice actor behind Moe since Season 1 ― about his recent Emmy nomination for a guest-starring role in ""Ray Donovan,"" The Huffington Post had to also ask how he felt about the fan theory surrounding his character and Bart. Well, Azaria doesn’t believe the theory. ""The Simpsons"" Azaria, who voices more characters on ""The Simpsons"" than any other actor, first reacted to the fan theory by laughing. Then he said, ""Uhh, that’s absurd. I never heard that before."" Not an auspicious start for the theory, but Azaria did do a minor backpedal and said, ""Wait, now that I’m thinking about it, he did sort of take a shine to Maggie. And he has often sort of ... "" Azaria then paused what little credence he was affording the theory and continued, ""But no ... I think Moe kind of is what he is. He hates pretty much everyone and has no patience for children."" The voice actor went on to explain that Moe ""is not the brightest bulb in the box"" and summed up by saying, ""that’s really all the explanation you need,"" before laughing again. To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface. ""Oh, yeah, I would say for sure,"" said Azaria. ""That’s how I’ve been playing it."" Watch Bart’s prank calls on Moe from over the years:","To get a final nail to the theory’s coffin, HuffPost pressed on whether Azaria was definitely saying Bart has successfully been tricking Moe this whole time like the show makes it seem on the surface."

But you won't find any of those things in Tom and June Simpson's 25,000-square-foot home. What you will find however, are eye-popping features including life-size replicas of the some of the most famous places in the world. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the couple loved the vibe of California homes, so they hired a West Coast-trained luxury builder to create their dream house. But while there is a certain West Coast look to the home (such as the exterior), some of the home's features defy any sort of decor classification. Such as recreations of the Oval Office and the Tampa Theater. There's also a ""memorabilia Hall Of Fame"" that includes items from John Lennon, Elvis and Liberace (of course).

751,"Jay Z helped bring the Nets to Brooklyn, but the rapper isn't staying with the team -- or its brand new home -- for long. Since starting Roc Nation Sports, a new agency with marquee signings like Robinson Cano, Kevin Durant and Victor Cruz, the rapper and mogul had already begun offloading his stake in the Nets organization. (He sold his one-fifteenth of one percent to head coach Jason Kidd for $500,000.) Interestingly, his ownership in the center itself is proving to be far more valuable. According to the New York Times, Jay Z owns a little less than one-fifth of one percent of the venue, a stake that's currently valued at about $1.5 million (the whole venue has a potential worth of $741 million). According to Forbes, however, Jay's share could actually be worth significantly more, given the overwhelming success of the Brooklyn venue. UPDATE: Roc Nation disputed Forbes' report, though the company didn't indicate which part (Is he selling his share and just getting less? Is he not selling at all?). Jay Z, who officially announced that he was leaving the Nets in April, has used his ownership in the team and the venue as brag points in songs and responded to criticism that he's over-stating his importance in the organization given his status as a very minority owner. ""It doesn't matter what percentage,"" he said while performing at Barclays a massive residency that christened the venue. ""The story is that a black kid from a single parent house made it from [the Marcy Projects] from about six minutes away from here. So the fact that I have any ownership in this franchise is f--king amazing. The fact that I have any ownership in this venue is f--king amazing. Don't let them diminish your accomplishment or dim your shine. It's f--king amazing."" In the song ""F.U.T.W."" off his latest album, ""Magna Carta Holy Grail,"" Jay again returns to the point with searing bitterness: ""One-percent of a billion is more than these n---as ever seen; still, they want to act like it's an every day thing.""

752,"It sounds like a dream: Checking your bank balance to find it higher, much higher, than it should be. But it can — and does — happen. American consumers have seen bank mistakes in their favor for thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. ""I felt like I was in a Monopoly moment,"" Leslie Holland told NBC about opening a statement from her brokerage account to see $23,000 that wasn't hers. ""Like getting the card that says bank error in your favor: Collect $200."" ""You do have that moment of 'Oh my God, I won the lottery,'"" said Holland, a marketing executive in Louisville, Kentucky. She didn't call her bank immediately. ""I was walking around in windfall shock. You think about 'Can I keep it?'"" Mike Lieberman had the same thought after the sale of his Brooklyn apartment in 2014. After he signed over his proceeds to a visibly tired teller, he noticed the deposit slip showed a mistake in his favor — to the tune of $700,000. ""It's weird,"" he told NBC News. ""Like in a movie when you see something happens to a person and a million things run through their mind in a split second. I looked at it [and thought] 'Holy cr*p, this is really not right. Can I keep it, can I spend it, can I invest it and give it back before anyone notices?' This all goes through your head really fast."" Industry insiders insist that while mistakes do happen, they are very few compared to the billions of successful transactions carried out every day. ""We conduct billions of transactions on a daily basis that are correct on both sides,"" said Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. But ""there's always the potential for human error."" And when mistakes are made, ""'Don't keep it,' is the firm advice,"" Johnson said. ""Eventually, the bank will come back to the customer. First they'll reverse the transaction but also potentially generate a police report after effective research, meaning the bank will contact the customer ... and ask the logical questions: Did they notice that it was inadvertently deposited, why didn't they alert the bank, why didn't they return the funds. It creates a whole confluence of events that are not attractive."" One Georgia teen learned this the hard way. After spending $30,000 in his bank account that didn't belong to him, the young man earned a 10-year sentence, according to local news reports. A teller had deposited a check from a client with the same last name into the teen's account; he spent most of the funds on a BMW. Lieberman, a former neuroscientist, speculated on how a person might make such a bad decision. The same part of the brain that gives us a rush when, say, we win a hand of cards, kicks in when we confront a scenario like unexpected money, Lieberman suggested. The limbic system is like the rewards circuitry. ""There's a lot of dopamine signaling ... your heart rate goes up, your pupils dilate, you start sweating. That's when you make bad decisions. A lot of this is evolutionary response."" The pre-frontal cortex, which controls reasoning and judgment, is one of the last parts of the brain to fully develop. ""It takes training and learning and life experience"" to not let that quick rush override your judgment, said Lieberman. ""I'm fortunate that I didn't do something stupid."" After his split-second deliberations, Lieberman pointed out the $700,000 mistake to the teller. Holland pointed out her bank's error, too. ""At the end of the day this isn't my money and I kept visualizing a little old lady who's missing $23,000. I'm glad my mother taught me right from wrong,"" she said. To avoid such situations, keep a close eye on your accounts. ""Manage your balance yourself in addition to what your bank is doing,"" Johnson said. Online banking may have made it easy to throw out the old fashioned check registers, but he uses his to reconcile his account to the penny, ""even though I only write a check to the woman who takes care of our cats every two months."" Software is also available to double check the bank's figures. And at the teller line, look at the deposit slip as confirmation and verify it is the amount intended. Also, Johnson said, double check remote deposits made with phones. ""It's really important in this world to protect yourself and to take responsibility even though we largely depend on financial institutions to do that for us,"" Johnson said. Still not convinced? Consider this: ""Back to my cybersecurity paranoia, some measures assist customers in protecting from unauthorized transactions on the other side,"" he said. ""You can definitely play a major role in the first line of defense."" Because even if you're not in a hurry to report that big deposit, we would all want to know right away if money's going out that shouldn't.","And when mistakes are made, ""'Don't keep it,' is the firm advice,"" Johnson said. ""Eventually, the bank will come back to the customer."

758,"Groupon India is offering an unusual deal on cheap onions, and the sale has turned out to be as chaotic as designer-label Black Friday shopping. The weeklong bargain began Sept. 5, and offers 1 kilogram of onions at 9 rupees (about $0.14) for 3,000 buyers each day. The signature whimsical Groupon ad reads thus: People haven’t experienced onions in a long, long time. That sweet, pungent aroma of onions being sautéed to a nice golden brown before being added to your mum’s signature curry is no longer familiar. This much-coveted, much-written-about, much-craved-for vegetable is now almost as expensive as caviar, diamonds and Donald Trump’s wig! Men are scrambling to the market to pick the perfect onion ring to please their ladies. Groupon had no idea how right that ad was. It took only 44 minutes to sell the first 3,000 kilograms of onions, and the sudden traffic spike subsequently crashed Groupon's Indian site, according to Al Jazeera America. Groupon India didn't anticipate that the discounted kitchen staple would turn into its most popular sales offer. The site's Chief Executive Ankur Warikoo said the deal was meant as a fun promotion. ""It was meant to generate excitement by selling onions at a knock-down price. We deliberately put the cap at one kilo. It is really intended to be something fun,"" he told the Agence France-Presse. Warikoo also took to Twitter to remark on the popularity of the deal. 3000kgs of Onions sold in 44 mins, 30mins of which the site was down, due to our highest ever traffic! #unreal http://t.co/Zhvt97XIkZ — Ankur Warikoo (@warikoo) September 6, 2013 On Sept. 9, the site sold out of the deal in just seven minutes. It urged customers to come back on Sept. 10 at 1 p.m., and also noted that 17,065 deals had been purchased thus far. The reason for Groupon's success was shrewd timing. According to The Wall Street Journal, onion prices in India jumped about 90 percent in August to $0.86 a kilogram, up from about $0.46 a kilogram. Al Jazeera estimates onions may now cost up to $1.57 per kilogram in India. Earlier in August, the prohibitively high price of onions, a staple of Indian cuisine, became a major talking point in India's 2013 elections for nine legislative assemblies, particularly for the Bharatiya Janta Party, or BJP, which lost the Delhi Assembly elections in 1998 when the price of onions hit $0.94 per kilogram. The BJP has been selling onions at around $0.63 a kilogram around the city to aid those who cannot afford inflated prices, according to CNN's Indian Broadcast News Live.",1 kilogram of onions at 9 rupees

If you need a refresher of what the Mods and Creation Kit will entail, you can view the trailer below. The mod support was likely delayed due to the whole 900mb limitation controversy, which upset the majority of the Fallout 4 PlayStation fan base. Now, almost a month after delaying the mod support, Bethesda has tweeted the following statement: "" We’re working w/ Sony on Fallout 4 Mod support for PS4. The process is still under evaluation. As soon as we learn more, we will share news."" Clearly, issues remain unresolved between Sony and Bethesda Game Studios in regards to console mods, and with no release date or form of announcement in site, the PS4 community is becoming restless and impatient.

763,"Not counting last Sunday's Golden Globe Awards, the last time we saw Aaron Paul he drove off into who knows where as Jesse Pinkman on the last episode of ""Breaking Bad."" Now, for Paul, comes the difficult part: still embracing the character that made him famous, but moving on as an actor to something different. ""Hellion"" -- which premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday afternoon -- is certainly different for those who know Paul best as Pinkman. Paul plays Hollis, a widower alcoholic who loves his two young sons, but doesn't have the wherewithal or time to monitor their every move. That leads his oldest son, Jacob (Josh Wiggins), into many run-ins with the law -- which threatens to tear what's left of this family apart. When you meet Aaron Paul in person, he's pretty much exactly what you'd hope him to be: very enthusiastic and very blunt, but still in a charming, boyish way. We met off Park City's Main Street to discuss life after Jesse Pinkman -- Paul has a plethora of upcoming projects -- and his now-famous appearance on ""The Price is Right."" I was just looking at your IMDb page and realized you were on both ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Melrose Place,"" and you played different characters. Yeah, you know, that was when my career, I thought, was taking off. And then I didn't work for like six months. But, yeah, the original ""90210."" It's a classic. It is a classic. Luke Perry directed my episode! I didn't realize that. Yeah. ""Hellion"" is not false advertising. Jacob is a hellion. Yes! He is absolutely a hellion. Quite the opposite as just a day-to-day person -- Josh is incredible. Hollis has had a tough time. It probably doesn't help that he wears that Astros hat and that's such a sad team to root for right now. I know ... It just adds to his woes. [Laughs] But, you know, he's a diehard fan. He believes in them. You don't jump off the bandwagon. You've got to believe in your team, man! Through the highs and lows! It was nice watching you play someone who is so different than Jesse Pinkman. Was that important to you? Absolutely. For me, it's always about doing something that I've never done before. And that's just exciting to me. You know, mix it up. I've always considered myself a character actor. Still? Yeah, I think so. I would hope so. You just played one of the most popular characters in television history. But that was a character, though! So you could say that about any actor. Right. Absolutely. But there are actors who play the same role in every single thing. Do you know what I mean? Okay, I see what you're saying. They play the same tone in everything. I don't talk like Jesse Pinkman. You tweet like him. During the show, yeah. I absolutely embodied Jesse Pinkman. You know, I'm just giving what the fans want, man! But yeah, they like it. They love it whenever I say ""bitch."" You said it during a Golden Globes speech. Yeah. Did you know that was coming? Vince Gilligan said, ""Listen, I really don't see this happening, but, if it does end up going our way, I'll say something and I'll just send it to you and have you just end it."" So, I had a feeling -- I knew what he was asking me to do. It seemed like a crowd-pleaser. ""Yeah, bitch!"" So, yeah, that's that. Hollis seems like an older guy that we're used to seeing you play. Was that intentional? He's just lived a different life. And Jesse definitely went through his struggles, but Hollis is going through his own set of struggles ... he's different. He's not Jesse Pinkman. Post-""Breaking Bad,"" are you happy with the roles you're being offered? A nice swath of different things? Yeah, it's great. But with a character as popular as Jesse, there's always a danger people would want you to keep doing that. That's why I just say no -- and I do things like ""Hellion."" Have you gotten offers that are too similar? Yeah. A lot of people want me to play -- I mean, great scripts! -- but people that are dealing with drug problems or that sort of thing. It's just kind of like the obvious choice. But, I'm just, for right now -- I'm not saying I'm never going to go down that path 10, 15, 30 years from now -- but I'm saying right now, for me, it would just be idiotic for me to jump onto another Jesse Pinkman-esque type role. And so that's why I try and do something different like ""Hellion"" or like ""Exodus""... Directed by Ridley Scott... Ridley Scott, yeah. And it's biblical, so that's a little different than Jesse as well. I assume ""Need For Speed"" is not biblical. ""Need For Speed"" is not biblical, no. But ""Need for Speed"" is not Jesse Pinkman, either. What should we expect from that character? Well, Tobey Marshall is a guy who runs an auto body shop. He is obsessed with racing -- he lives and breaths it. It's in his blood. His father started this auto body shop -- and his father dies and now he's left with trying to keep his business afloat. He's got his shit together -- not a drug addict. He doesn't do meth; he doesn't kill people. Different. When you were on ""The Price is Right,"" did you have any idea you were going to be called down to contestants' row? No. So it's a complete surprise? Yeah, yeah. But it's not like they're pulling a name out of a hat at random. They want someone who is going to be excited. Yeah, they bring in 10 people at a time and you kind of do an interview process. And that's that. They want people that are excited. And I went there -- you saw -- in a crazy outfit... We've all seen now. I was wearing a crazy outfit and I drank a bunch of Red Bull. I had the most energy of any human being! And they called my name and I think the combination of them calling my name and the combination of the six cans of Red Bull -- I was just teetering on the line of having a heart attack. But, yeah, it was great. Were you surprised when that video became an Internet sensation? No, I was not surprised it became an Internet sensation. That video is crazy. I was surprised that it took that long to surface. Jay Leno -- [sarcastically] bless him -- he's the one that made that happen. When I was a guest on his show, he brought up that video.","Now, for Paul, comes the difficult part: still embracing the character that made him famous, but moving on as an actor to something different."
765,"Zackery Michael/Abercrombie & Fitch Model Alex Libby was the face of a recent campaign. The foreign tourists who line up at Abercrombie & Fitch are increasingly nervous about spending money — and that could hurt the brand's turnaround. The euro's value against the dollar has declined steadily in recent years, which means that European tourists aren't shopping as much, Eric Beder, analyst at Wunderlich Securities, wrote in a recent note to clients. "" With [foreign exchange] still a key issue, and tourist traffic remaining a negative, we continue to be cautious on ANF and believe the company still faces a number of key issues in terms of fashion outlook, productivity and an overall weak teen segment to overcome before regaining anything similar to a premium multiple,"" Beder said. The tourist traffic is crucial — even if Abercrombie & Fitch is America's most hated retail brand , tourists appeared to love it. If they're abandoning Abercrombie & Fitch, that could only spell more trouble for the company. A few years ago, tourists were a big component to the company's success. The Wall Street Journal highlighted why, exactly, tourists would wait in line to enter New York City's flagship store. Reuters/Benoit Tessier Shoppers hold bags with clothing purchases on the opening day of operations by retailers Abercrombie & Fitch outside their Paris store on the Champs Elysees May 19, 2011.

""Expect Hollister to be the most advanced of the chains, while Abercrombie still remains very much a work in progress,"" Beder writes.

766,"If you’re of the belief that anonymously creeping through profiles is the best part of Facebook, then the new Stories feature may not be for you. As the name implies, this is an attempt to co-opt certain elements of Snapchat—filters, self-deleting videos, and direct messaging—into Facebook. Much like Snapchat or Instagram Live, you can see who watched your story, as Facebook provides basic stats on how many views your story accumulates.  Facebook’s latest attempt to be an all-in-one social media platform is great if you don’t want to switch apps, or just don’t understand Snapchat. However, the anonymity provided by creeping through profiles (particularly public ones of people who aren’t your Facebook ""friends"") is gone when you enter Stories mode. As you can see from the above screen grab, courtesy of CNet, there’s a clear list of the people who view your story. So if you’re creeping on a particular story, the person who posted will definitely know. Another potential drawback of Facebook’s new enhancement is that Facebook isn’t currently tracking screenshots of stories. So if you’re having thoughts of some Yo Gotti-inspired action in your DMs, be aware that someone could be potentially taking pictures of your videos before they self-delete.

I’m eating burgers at lunchtime, and then you go do a scene where you’re hosed down and soaking wet in a white T-shirt, it’s so clingy and you’re self-conscious about it. As comic books are primarily a visual medium, a character’s look is always the most important thing about them. Each hero and villain had to be unique and be able to catch the eye if the creators wanted them to catch on. When these characters make the transition to the movie screen, the look has to go with them, as it has become iconic. Yet, now it isn’t simply an artist’s drawing, but an actual person who has to create that look. Harley Quinn is no different in Suicide Squad . She is colorful and flashy and has an attitude to match. While Margot Robbie understands the need to represent Harley Quinn properly, it doesn’t mean she loves the clothes. They make her more than a little self conscious.Margot Robbie is the subject of a profile in the New York Times which covers her rise to fame through The Wolf of Wall Street as well as her upcoming takeover of the summer, where she’ll be featured in both The Legend of Tarzan and. As part of the feature Robbie talks about what it’s like putting on things like tight shirts andshort shorts, saying:Apparently Robbie actually talked to director David Ayer about the clothes, but he informed her that denim overalls did not match with Harley’s iconography. Harley Quinn was actually a creation of the 90’s Batman: The Animated Series but the character was so popular that she eventually made her way into the comics. In the animated series, she was usually seen in a traditional harlequin costume, but the character has evolved over time to wear more normal, if noticeable, clothing. While having to run around in skimpy clothing would make most people feel exposed, Margot Robbie seems to have a clear understanding of the importance of having the look match the character. Otherwise, Harley just isn’t Harley.","As Margot, no, I don’t like wearing that. I’m eating burgers at lunchtime, and then you go do a scene where you’re hosed down and soaking wet in a white T-shirt, it’s so clingy and you’re self-conscious about it."

771,"Artificial Eye It’s a question which has plagued humanity for millennia – what do women really want in bed? Hell, it was even one of the questions posed by the thought provoking philosophical masterpiece What Women Want. But, thankfully, now a male escort from Australia has stepped forward and put an end to our unquenchable inquisitive thirst once and for all, according to the Daily Mail. Enter Ryan James. A photo posted by Ryan James (@ryanjamessydney) on Mar 7, 2015 at 3:06am PST Ryan is a Sydney based escort who meets women of all ages for sex – charging anything between $400 and $6,000 for his services which can feature just a hotel quickie or a weekend away. But what is it that women really want from Ryan? Well, to be frank, it’s not too fucking hard to guess. What they want is more than just sex, they want companionship and to feel a connection. Ryan said: Pretty much every single client that I see there’s some companionship element to the booking. From what I see, men are more focused on the sexual side of things. Women are focused on the sex too, they wouldn’t come to see me without it, but we spend a lot of time talking as well. Many of the women I see could easily go to a bar and pick a guy up and have sex that way. But they want a difference experience. Sometimes it’s that they’ve been recently divorced, or they’re still married but haven’t been intimate in a long time. I’ve had clients who are couples who want a threesome, and women who are virgins. A photo posted by Ryan James (@ryanjamessydney) on Oct 29, 2014 at 10:34pm PDT But what about when it comes to the sex? What is it that women want, and need, in the bedroom? Well, that’s not too hard to guess either. Ryan explained: Clients say to me that with a lot of sexual encounters they have the guy makes it about him, he comes and then it’s over. They want the focus to be on them. Many do like reciprocating, but they want their pleasure to be in focus. Now, although this seems like the most mundane and incredibly obvious answer ever, it’s hard to argue against Ryan because, after all, he’s in high demand across the entirety of Australia. Ryan can’t even take on new clients because he’s fully booked up with his current ones throughout the foreseeable future. So there you have it folks – more attention with a side order of companionship. Pretty simple really...",companionship and to feel a connection.
772,"There are definitely mixed opinions when it comes to co-sleeping and bed sharing. While many people think it's a bad idea, one dad says it's time for people to allows moms follow their instincts. David Brinkley, a father of two, shared a photo of his wife sleeping in the same bed as their kids. Brinkley claimed he recently overheard his wife on the phone with a friend, talking about co-sleeping - the Brinkley family frequently co-sleeps - and his wife's friend apparently exclaimed she couldn't believe Brinkley was okay with such an arrangement. ""I heard the other person ask 'doesn't your husband hate that? My husband would never let me do that.' This blew my mind and has bothered me for days,"" Brinkley wrote. He went on to defend his wife and her choice, and encourages others, especially dads, to do the same. ""So, I just decided to come out as a man and set a few things straight. I do NOT hate any part of what makes my wife the mother that she is. I would NEVER degrade or disregard anything that she feels like doing for my children. Do I have to squeeze into a small corner of the bed sometimes? Yeah? But my God how beautiful does she look holding my children? Making them feel loved and safe? The thing is that our wives only experience these little seasons in motherhood for a short time,"" he wrote on the post, which has since received over 21,000 shares and 115,000 likes. Whether you agree with the idea of co-sleeping or not, Brinkley's message goes behind bed sharing. The core of what he is saying has to do with husbands respecting their wives as mothers. ""I just want to say that I am proud of the decisions my wife makes as a mom and I support every single one of them. I would never want to rob her of this time she has or these seasons that are in reality too short to not enjoy. Please respect your wives as mothers."" And let us tell you, that message certainly resonated with people. Of course dads should always speak up if they feel their children are unsafe, because the best type of parenting is when both parents are involved. But it's also important to trust your wife's instincts because motherhood is a very powerful thing.","""So, I just decided to come out as a man and set a few things straight.

774,"You’ve blown a job interview or presentation. What if you could get a do-over? A humble plea for a second chance sometimes reopens closed doors if it strikes just the right note: Email new evidence of your qualifications for a job. Apologize when you’ve misinterpreted a question, or send more information to clear up a misunderstanding. Do-overs for job seekers are rare, and the few who get a second chance make an argument that is both highly persuasive and humble, says Susan Peppercorn, a senior consultant with ClearRock Inc., an executive-coaching and career-consulting firm in Boston. ""The key to any redo is, what can you do for the company?"" Ms. Peppercorn says. Abhijit Phadnis was excited as an M.B.A. student years ago about landing a financial-manager position at a consumer-products company. He was deeply disappointed when he was rejected. At Ms. Peppercorn’s suggestion, Mr. Phadnis emailed the hiring manager thanking him and asking for feedback. He was told that his interview answers focused too much on his past work on various teams, and failed to explain how his individual skills fit the job. Mr. Phadnis fired off an impassioned email asking the hiring manager for a second chance. Hoping the job hadn’t been filled yet, he admitted he hadn’t done as well as he should have in the interviews, explained that he had admired the company and used its products since childhood, and promised to offer additional information. ""If you give me another chance, you won’t be disappointed. I’ll show I can do what you’re looking for,"" he wrote. A brief email soon arrived, suggesting he get in touch. After a phone call and another round of interviews, Mr. Phadnis got the job. It isn’t enough simply to ask a stranger for a second chance. ""You have to give them something new,"" such as work samples or examples of past accomplishments, says Robert Hellmann, a New York career coach with the Five O’Clock Club. To gauge whether you might need a do-over, try to get a sense of the impression you made and what interviewers saw as your weaknesses. Mr. Hellman suggests asking at the end of interviews, ""How do you feel about moving my candidacy forward?"" and ""How do I compare with others you’re considering for the job?"" You can also ask for such feedback by email immediately after the interview. Then provide information aimed at filling those gaps. Even the most logical do-over requests may fail. A job interview was going well for Greg Zippi until he told the hiring manager travel wasn’t his favorite thing, though he was accustomed to it and entirely willing to do as much travel as needed, says Mr. Zippi, president of DecisionWise, a Springville, Utah, organizational development consulting firm. He soon learned he’d been rejected because the hiring manager ""heard me say I didn’t want to travel,"" Mr. Zippi says. In a follow-up email, ""I fell on my sword, saying, ‘I apologize if I confused you,’"" and insisted he was willing to travel. But the door was closed, Mr. Zippi says. Getting a do-over takes luck. After doing well in six interviews for a job years ago, Tom Borghesi assumed he had it locked up. He mistook an important talk with a senior executive who would be the final decision maker for a casual meet-and-greet. He showed up in khakis and a sport coat and was caught off-guard when the executive peppered him with questions about his résumé. The executive walked him out after only a few minutes, leaving him thinking, ""That did not go well,"" says Mr. Borghesi, chief operating officer of Open Systems Technologies, a New York staffing firm. Mr. Borghesi called the executive and apologized, blaming himself and asking humbly for another chance. The executive said yes and Mr. Borghesi showed up for the second interview dressed ""as if straight off a magazine cover,"" taking pains to show respect, stand up straight, make eye contact and offer a firm handshake. He got the job. It is different to ask a boss or a colleague for a do-over. You might make a case that a second chance will benefit your team or department. A do-over can also be a quick way to recover from a misunderstanding. Shaun Eli Breidbart was shocked when a boss told him in a performance review that he wasn’t showing enough initiative on his job as a bank employee. Instead of waiting a year for the next review, he asked for another review in three months. He also began taking more initiative. The next review was much better, says Mr. Breidbart. Even so, he has since changed careers and is now a comedian and producer of comedy shows living in Scarsdale, N.Y. Recovering from a failed presentation isn’t an easy fix, but it can be done. Mr. Hellmann coached a newly promoted marketing director whose boss criticized her after a presentation for finding fault with other departments and straying from the strategy he had set. She became defensive and walked out of the meeting. Mr. Hellmann urged her to set aside her pride. She apologized to her boss, admitted she shouldn’t have been defensive, repeated his criticisms to ensure that she understood, and asked for a second chance to do a similar presentation. Her boss agreed, and her next performance was a success. It isn’t wise to ask for a lot of do-overs at the same task, managers say. Jonathan Wasserstrum, chief executive officer of TheSquareFoot.com, a New York real estate technology company, grants them freely ""as long as employees are trying to push the ball forward and challenge themselves,"" he says.","A humble plea for a second chance sometimes reopens closed doors if it strikes just the right note: Email new evidence of your qualifications for a job.

776,"The man in charge of the Oscars awards envelopes has been blamed for the gaffe that saw La La Land named best picture. PriceWaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan was supposed to hand the best picture envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday. In a statement, PwC said he ""mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead."" It's also emerged that Cullinan tweeted a picture of Emma Stone backstage just minutes before the mix-up took place. The tweet has since been deleted, though it survives on various websites and on a cached Google page. Cullinan had a complete set of envelopes on one side of the stage, while Martha Ruiz, another PwC accountant, had a duplicate set on the other. This explains why both best actress winner Emma Stone and Beatty ended up in possession of an envelope related to the best actress award. Beatty was evidently confused by the contents of the envelope, passing the card onto his former Bonnie and Clyde co-star. Seeing the words ""La La Land"" beneath Emma Stone's name, Dunaway declared her musical romance the winner of the best picture award. Only after that film's producers had begun their acceptance speeches was it revealed that Moonlight had in fact won the award. ""Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr Cullinan or his partner,"" said the accountancy firm. One of Cullinan's colleagues told Variety that the accountant ""feels very, very terrible"" and ""is very upset about this mistake"". The mix-up brought a chaotic end to Sunday's Oscars ceremony, hosted in Los Angeles by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. Here are six more things we've learned about one of the most extraordinary awards show debacles in recent times. 1) The Academy is really, really sorry The organisers of the Academy Awards ""deeply regret the mistakes"" that led to La La Land being wrongly named best picture. Moonlight had actually won the award, but the envelope mix-up led to Dunaway announcing the wrong film. ""We apologise to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,"" the Academy said. ""We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances."" In its statement, the Academy said PwC had ""taken full responsibility for the breaches of established protocols that took place during the ceremony. ""We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward."" 2) It was all down to Trump President Trump and his policies were at the forefront of many attendees' minds on Sunday, with Gael Garcia Bernal among those to take issue with them on stage. ""As a Mexican, as a Latin-American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I'm against any form of wall that separates us,"" the actor said - a reference to Trump's plans to build a border wall between Mexico and the US. In his first comments on the Oscars, the president has suggested the awards ""were focused so hard on politics that they didn't get the act together at the end"". ""It was a little sad,"" he told the right-wing Breitbart website. ""It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn't feel like a very glamorous evening. ""I've been to the Oscars,"" continued the president. ""There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad."" 3) It didn't help the ratings The extraordinary end to Sunday's ceremony came too late to help boost the show's ratings, which were its smallest for almost 10 years. ABC's broadcast drew 32.9 million viewers in the US - a 4 per cent drop on the 2016 Oscars, which were seen by 34.4 million people. It was the smallest audience since the 2008 ceremony, which drew an average audience of 32 million. Despite the decline, the Oscars are still expected to be the most-watched non-sporting event on US TV this year. 4) Kimmel was meant to end the show with Matt Damon Back in his usual slot on late night television, Jimmy Kimmel revealed that he had originally intended to end the show in the audience, sat next to actor Matt Damon. ""We're sitting there and we notice some commotion going on,"" the Oscars host explained on Monday's edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live. ""And Matt says, 'I think I heard the stage manager say they got the winner wrong.' ""So you just kind of, well, the host will go onstage and clear this up. And then I remember, oh, I'm the host."" ""Have any of you here ever hosted the Oscars before?"" Kimmel asked his audience. ""Well, except for the end - it was a lot of fun.'' The result, he joked, ""was the weirdest TV finale since Lost"" - a reference to the long-running US drama series about strangers stranded on a tropical island. 5) Faye Dunaway's heels may have been involved According to Tuesday's Daily Mail, Beatty and Dunaway were meant to have descended a staircase before presenting the final award of the evening. But the paper claims the 76-year-old had difficulty climbing up the stairs in her high heels, so the pair started their presentation walk at the foot of the stairs instead. ""It's unclear whether this confusion contributes to the ensuing chaos,"" the paper's report continues. 6) The US State Department also had Twitter issues The US State Department's official Persian-language Twitter account tweeted congratulations to the Iranian people and Asghar Farhadi after the director's film The Salesman won the best foreign language film award. That was despite Farhadi, who did not attend the ceremony, having a speech read out in which he described President Trump's travel ban as ""inhumane"". A State department spokeswoman said the tweet was deleted ""to avoid any misperception that the USG [US government] endorsed the comments made in the acceptance speech.""","PwC said he ""mistakenly handed [them] the back-up envelope for actress in a leading role instead."""
783,"In Sweden, she's been a star since she was 10 - but Zara Larsson has her eyes set on global domination. Aged just 19, the star has racked up seven hits in the last 14 months, including the tropical pop smash Lush Life, which spent more than a year on the charts. Along the way, she's collaborated with Tinie Tempah and sung the official anthem of Euro 2016, but the highlight of her year was supporting Beyonce at Wembley Stadium. ""It was the best show on a tour I've ever seen. Wembley's such an incredible stadium. It's definitely one of the stadiums I want to stand on and have my own tour, one day."" Although she's already scored a number one single and album in her home country, Zara is starting from scratch in the UK - and releases her debut album, So Good, this week. Outgoing and dynamic, she talked the BBC through her career to date. Here's everything you need to know (and a few things you probably didn't) about Sweden's latest pop sensation. She suffers from sleep paralysis Writing on her Swedish-language website two years ago, the 19-year-old revealed she frequently has episodes of sleep paralysis. ""Oh my God, it's scary!"" she tells the BBC. ""Basically, you wake up and you literally cannot move. Your brain is active, but your body is not yet awake. ""It's weird. It lasts half a minute maybe - but it kind of feels like you're trapped there for half an hour. ""I get it a lot when I'm stressed out, or when I have a lot of things going on."" But Zara says there's an upside, too. Often, as she falls asleep, she's overcome by a sense of tremendous wellbeing (to paraphrase a certain Blur song). ""It's like a wave comes over me. Energy is just vibrating through your body and it's awesome."" She's shaken off her talent show past In 2008, Zara entered Talang Sverige - Sweden's version of Britain's Got Talent - mainly because there was no age restriction, unlike X Factor or Swedish Idol. Singing a heavily-accented, but vocally powerful, version of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On, she won the contest, and its 500,000 krona (£42,600) prize. ""I sounded like a little guinea pig!"" she laughs. But, incredibly, the contest led to nothing. ""Nobody really wanted to sign me, which I was devastated about,"" she says. ""I was like, 'oh my gosh, my career's over and it hasn't even started yet!' ""I didn't really want to do anything with Nickelodeon or Disney, so I just went back to school."" The break may have saved her. Rather than becoming a novelty act, washed up before she was a teenager, Zara re-emerged as a bona fide pop artist on her 15th birthday, with an EP that turned people's heads. ""When I released the first song, a lot of the people didn't even recognise me,"" she says. ""And the people that did were like, 'Oh my gosh, it's her!' ""So in Sweden, the talent show is like super-irrelevant. And that's great because usually it's very hard to wipe off that kind of Got Talent stain. ""It just stays on you - but it didn't for me."" She doesn't listen to other bands at festivals ...As we discovered when we played a game of ""So Good or So Bad?"" with Zara (watch above) People think she sounds like Rihanna When Zara released Lush Life in January last year, a lot of people thought it was Rihanna's comeback single. ""I don't know where it comes from but even my mom is like, 'You sound like Rihanna,'"" says the singer. ""I was very confused because I'd never really listened to her until pretty recently. It's not a bad comparison to have but I'm never going to be Rihanna, and I'm not trying to be. Don't expect her to hold back on social media From the moment Zara fired up her Instagram, pulled a condom over her leg and called out guys who ""think they're too big to wear protection"", it was clear Zara wouldn't be sticking to the record company script. Since then, she's voiced her support for Kesha - who is suing famed record producer Dr Luke for alleged sexual assault - and engaged in a war of words with R&B star Chris Brown, calling him ""a sexist, homophobic, transphobic trash"". ""That's who I am,"" says the star. ""I don't really have a 'vision' of who I want people to see me as. ""I just post whatever I feel like."" Her dad could have you killed (probably) Larsson was born in Stockholm at the tail end of the 1990s, moving to the suburbs when her younger sister Hanna was born. She was always singing - showing off to her parents' dinner-party guests; and serenading ""ladies on the subway, when I was like three"". But she didn't come from a musical family. Far from it. ""My dad was a military man, working in Navy intelligence,"" she says, ""so I know he can keep secrets, definitely."" While the exact nature of his job remains classified, Larsson swears he was the model parent. ""He's great and he's funny. You can ask him whatever and he always has the answer. Even if he doesn't, he will never admit it. So we had a lot of debates and discussions. That's the reason why I'm interested in everything. ""Now he's actually studying again - he wants to be a professor in war science."" Potential boyfriends beware. She won't sing lyrics that disrespect women Zara's breakout hit in the UK was Never Forget You - a duet with British producer MNEK that was written in just two hours. ""We work really well together,"" she marvels. ""It's just no question marks. I feel very relaxed and honest and open with him. "" They collaborated again on Ain't My Fault, a sassy, sexy club track that became Zara's fifth top 20 hit, late last year. ""We wrote it in five minutes,"" says Zara, ""Originally, it was about me stealing someone else's man. I was saying, 'It ain't my fault that you're not cute enough for him.'"" But after submitting the song to her record label, the singer had second thoughts. ""I was just like, 'Wait, hold up, I can't sing this'. It just didn't feel right. It felt like I'd broken the girl code, and I didn't want to do that."" Exercise is not her friend As a child, Zara attended the Royal Swedish Ballet School. ""I was very flexible,"" she says. ""It really taught me a lot about discipline and how to use my body. But these days I'm about as flexible as a... erm, a safe!"" In fact, she's so out of shape that a brief session with her personal trainer ended in disaster. ""I ran 200 metres and my trainer said, 'That was a great job, you ran pretty fast'. ""I said, 'I know!' so he told me to do it a second time. And when I came back, I threw up."" Her goal is to keep improving ""I'm on my way to becoming a true performer,"" the star wrote shortly after singing Lush Life on The Voice UK last year. So, does she not consider herself a fully-qualified pop phenomenon yet? ""You're never finished,"" she says. ""My inspiration for performing is Beyonce. I don't think Beyonce ever wakes up and thinks, 'Oh great I'm Beyonce, I'm just going to chill today.' ""She wants to be better, she wants to do bigger things and she wants to keep on evolving. ""That's what makes her great, and that's what I want to do.""",you wake up and you literally cannot move
786,"Jerusalem - Tucked away on a steep, potholed street in Sur Baher, a suburb in the southeastern hills of Jerusalem, Sarah Ali Dwayat's apartment sits empty. On the front porch, a large banner bears the photographs of five teenagers from the neighbourhood currently imprisoned by Israel. One of them is her 19-year-old son, Abed. The group stands accused of throwing stones at Israeli vehicles on a highway, allegedly causing the death of a driver, after clashes between police and Palestinian youths last September, on the eve of the Jewish New Year. The trial is still going on, but already some of their family members have been forced from their homes - the victims of new measures ostensibly aimed at deterring alleged Palestinian attackers. ""When we got the confiscation notice, we took all the furniture out, and now it's scattered with friends and neighbours,"" Sarah said, pushing back a metal sheet covering one window to sneak a look inside. Doorknobs to the home have been broken off, and entrances sealed with melted metal plates. Sarah, a widow for 15 years, and her 24-year-old daughter have moved to a smaller apartment in the same area, provided by a neighbour as a goodwill gesture. Sooner or later, they will have to start paying rent again, Sarah acknowledged - and with property prices sky-high in Jerusalem, they will not be able to afford it. ""We had just started renovation work. Abed had found a job and had started to help. We are still paying the debts,"" Sarah, 59, told Al Jazeera. ""When they came to seal the house [last month], a soldier told me, in Arabic, that it was to send a message to others, so they wouldn't carry out more acts of terror."" Since last October, tensions have boiled over into violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the blockaded Gaza Strip. During this period, the Israeli army has killed at least 206 Palestinians, including protesters, bystanders and alleged attackers, while 33 Israelis have been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a series of measures directed at alleged Palestinian attackers and their families, including the demolition or sealing of attackers' homes and the revocation of permanent residency status for Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem. Munir Nusseibeh, a human rights lawyer and director of the Community Action Centre at al-Quds University, believed that Sarah's son and two of his co-accused, Muhammad Abu Kaf, 17, and Mustafa Atrash, 18, were ""test cases"". Israel's interior minister issued a decision to strip all three of their Jerusalem residency in January, a move that is now being appealed in court. ""They are the first at risk of residency revocation for throwing stones, and the first whose families have been displaced from their homes for throwing stones,"" Nusseibeh told Al Jazeera. Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return. Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel? Abu Walid, father of Mustafa Atrash, who is on trial over stone-throwing allegations A letter to Abed's lawyer from the Israeli Interior ministry states that ""a permanent residency status in Israel is based on a material connection between the resident and the state"" and that it ""requires basic commitment and loyalty in view of the fact that residency, and all the more so permanent residency, is not a status which only grants rights without any obligations"". When Israel occupied and unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, Palestinians were designated as ""permanent residents"" rather than citizens of the state, a status akin to that of migrants in a foreign country. Since then, over 14,000 have had their residency revoked. Over the years, the criteria for revoking residency have broadened. Two decades ago, Israel's interior ministry revoked the residency of Palestinians who lived abroad for seven or more years, or who obtained residency or citizenship status in another country. But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their ""centre of life"" outside of Israel - such as in the West Bank or Gaza. Some 11,000 out of the 14,000 had their residency revoked under this policy. In 2006, three elected members of the Palestinian Legislative Council had their Jerusalem residency revoked on new grounds: ""breach of allegiance to the state"". Their case is still pending before the Supreme Court. ""No one was arguing that these parliamentarians posed a specific security threat to Israel, but rather it was because of their political belonging that they decided to cancel their right to live in Jerusalem,"" Nusseibeh said, noting that there are 13 known cases of residency revocation under the allegiance criteria. ""If the Supreme Court approves the residency revocations in the 2006 case based on breach of allegiance, this will make a new important precedent - it will be the first time that the Supreme Court approves revoking residency based on political, rather than security reasons,"" Nusseibeh said. ""All Palestinians in Jerusalem will be at risk of residency revocation according to the allegiance criteria, because Palestinians in East Jerusalem see the occupation as temporary and Israel as a foreign occupying power."" Abu Walid, the father of Mustafa Atrash, was indignant at this policy. ""Allegiance, which allegiance? We pay tax to the Israeli municipality, and we get nothing in return,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Did Yigal Amir get his citizenship revoked for killing the prime minister of Israel?"" he added, referring to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist in 1995. Abir Joubran-Dakwar, a lawyer for the Israeli human rights organisation Hamoked who is working on the Sur Baher case, noted that there are a number of specific criteria under which citizenship can be revoked, including ""breach of allegiance"". However, this does not apply to residency, she said: ""A person who has his citizenship revoked becomes stateless, but the interior ministry will still have to give him a permanent residency status."" Israel's interior ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the matter. At the end of April, Israel's attorney-general temporarily suspended the revocation in the Sur Baher case, until the Supreme Court comes to a decision in the 2006 case. Human rights groups, including B'Tselem, have argued in the past that home demolitions, denial of building permits, restrictions on family reunification, and the building of the separation wall are all among the variety of methods used by Israel to forcibly displace Palestinians and maintain a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, in violation of international law. ""I believe the aim of this policy is to add a new method for the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem, to be able to displace even larger numbers,"" Nusseibeh said. ""That's our concern.""","But after the Oslo Accords, a new policy was introduced whereby Palestinians would lose residency rights if they established their ""centre of life"" outside of Israel - such as in the West Bank or Gaza."

""On the way home I wondered if Young Thug would've liked the shoot we put together for him,"" the video reads near the end. ""But I guess none of that matters now.

790,"Donald Trump praised Vladimir Putin on the national stage again — here's what it all means Donald Trump is again under fire for warm comments he directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin, this time calling him a stronger leader than US President Barack Obama at a national-security forum this week. ""If he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him,"" the Republican nominee said. ""I've already said he is very much of a leader. The man has very strong control over his country."" ""You can say, 'Oh, isn’t that a terrible thing,' I mean, the man has very strong control over his country,"" the Manhattan billionaire added. ""Now it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly in that system he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader."" While Trump's fascination and appreciation of Putin is nothing new, the latest round of comments made during NBC's Commander-in-Chief Forum on Wednesday has seen an increased defense from some in the GOP. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said it's ""inarguable"" that Putin has been ""a stronger leader"" in Russia than Obama's been in the US. Rep. Steve King of Iowa said he thought Putin was stronger than Obama because he saw Russian nationalism increase ""substantially"" and that Russians ""are proud of being Russians today."" Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt also joined the fray, insisting that although Putin is ""an evil man"" and Obama is ""good"" but ""incompetent,"" Putin has served the national interest of Russia better, and ""he's eating USA's lunch."" Other prominent conservatives delivered strong statements disavowing any positive thought from the Republican Party toward Putin, a subject that has remained in the headlines as Trump refuses to say a negative word about the autocratic Russian leader. House Speaker Paul Ryan called Putin an ""aggressor that does not share our interests"" and who violates the ""sovereignty of neighboring countries,"" while adding that it appears Putin's regime is involved in ""cyberattacks on our political system,"" referencing the hacks on prominent Democratic organizations. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the ""calculation from Trump unnerves me to my core,"" and although Putin has ""walked all over Obama,"" Graham wouldn't agree that the Russian leader is better than the US president. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and once in the running to be Trump's running mate, expressed concern at the idea Trump welcomes compliments from Putin. ""You know, flattery can be used as a tool that sometimes bears very negative fruit,"" he said. ""One has to be careful about letting flattery affect one’s relationship with a person or a country."" But Trump's apparent approval of Putin has gone a long way with rank-and-file GOP voters, who, in 2012, had a presidential nominee in Mitt Romney that called Russia ""our number-one geopolitical foe"" after a hot mic picked up Obama telling Russia's then-President Dmitry Medvedev that he'd have ""more flexibility"" to discuss missile defense after the election. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, Putin's net-favorability rating in July 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, was -54 among Democrats and -66 among Republicans. A poll from the same outlets released in August 2016 showed that Putin's net-favorability rating among Democrats remained identical. But the Russian leader's rating among Republicans improved dramatically, from -66 to -27. ""Of all the damage Trump can do to the American conservative movement, making it pro-Putin rather than pro-freedom could be the most serious,"" Weekly Standard editor and ""Never Trump"" conservative Bill Kristol posted to Twitter. Putin with Barack Obama. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters The comparison between Putin and Obama Trump's contention that Putin is stronger than Obama can be interpreted in two ways: One, Putin has projected more strength on the world stage than Obama, which many Republicans and foreign-policy experts would likely agree with. The other is that Putin has tight control over his country, something that most would be hesitant to praise, considering the differing systems of government and the means by which Putin has done so on the backs of his countrymen. In terms of his consolidation of governmental power, Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, told Business Insider that he thinks Putin is the ""singularly most powerful individual on the planet."" ""I think that's true because he's consolidated so much more power, sort of delegitimized the opposition,"" he said. Putin's been able to bring Russia's judiciary system under his control, while governors are now under Kremlin control, he added. ""Now there's no question that that's allowed Putin to project more force for Russia internationally,"" Bremmer said. Bremmer argued that Putin has been able to improve Russia's political position in an ""almost unimaginable"" way since gaining power. ""There's no question that Russia has managed [to improve its international hand] by virtue of using its military might in Ukraine as well as in Syria and more broadly in the Middle East in ways that the Americans would not and that the Europeans would not,"" he said. ""There's no question that Russia has shown itself as a more relevant actor and has gotten itself a larger seat at the table."" ""They wouldn't have had a 90-minute meeting with Obama [at the G-20 summit],"" he added. ""Obama could say I'm not seeing [President Rodrigo] Duterte in the Philippines because of a mistranslation of an interview he gave to a journalist. Obama wouldn't be doing that to Putin right now."" But the country's military excursions in Crimea and Syria have been countered by a diminishing economy. Bremmer said: ""[L]et's be clear, Russia is in decline. NATO has expanded. The European Union has enlarged. And most importantly, while NATO and the EU have become a little weaker, China is becoming much stronger. And much stronger and much faster than Russia is."" ""China is investing overwhelmingly in all these countries around Russia, and they're developing much more influence than Russia has in Russia's own backyard. And this is going to be a very serious consequence, a very serious negative consequence to the Russians over the medium to long-term. No question when you look at the geopolitical map that Russia is one of these countries that over the long-term looks to be in terminal geopolitical decline, and Putin has facilitated that."" Although Putin's favorability ratings remain high, as Trump pointed out, it is not the best time to be a Russian living under Putin's government. In Trump's worldview, Bremmer said, it's ""completely accurate"" to say Putin is stronger than Obama. ""But in a worldview, would you care more about how your citizens feel about the future for themselves and for their nation, that they have common values, that they act as a community, that they look out for each other, that the leader engenders values that in turn make them better citizens?"" Bremmer asked. ""Clearly, Obama has not been the best, but he's clearly been vastly better than Putin."" And in terms of being stronger on the domestic stage, it's impossible to argue that Obama is ""stronger"" than Putin because the Russian president does not have any of the constraints and checks and balances put forth by the American system of government. ""If he wants to lock someone up, it's a lot easier,"" Bremmer said of Putin. ""If he wants to go into a neighboring country, he can do it. It's much harder for the Americans. If you want to make a statement that is most authoritarian leaders are stronger than most American presidents in terms of what they can do, you can say that. That is objectively fact."" ""Putin would be unequivocally a stronger leader than Hillary [Clinton] or Trump would be, by that definition,"" he added. Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist and president of the Potomac Strategy Group, agreed with Bremmer's sentiment, calling an Obama to Putin comparison on domestic politics ""apples to oranges."" ""How do you define strong leadership?"" he rhetorically asked in an interview with Business Insider. ""Was Hitler a strong leader? What're we trying to say here?"" ""You want to say that Putin exudes strength and with terrible tactics, rules with an iron fist in his country, and that compares very differently to Obama, who in many ways has been a weak president,"" he continued. A result of Putin's displays of strength that Trump appeared to praise is that he's become more negatively viewed by not just the US, but by ""all the western powers and by all the developed nations,"" Mackowiak argued. The GOP strategist added that if Trump were elected and tried ""1/20th"" of what Putin's done in Russia, the Manhattan billionaire would ""be impeached."" ""And I have no doubt about that,"" he said. ""I think it'd be a unifying moment for the country."" AP Photo/Evan Vucci What the stance on Putin from Trump means for the GOP Trump's position on Putin and on Russia could not be further removed from the GOP's stance toward the nation in recent years. But, with the Republican nominee now differing in his outlook toward Russia, the party is no longer virtually unified in opposition to Putin. ""What's really sad here is there was damn near unanimity among Republican Party elected officials and foreign-policy community and national-security community on the threat and opinion on Putin and what he's doing,"" Mackowiak said. ""Not everyone maybe wants to give lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, not everyone wants to institute a no-fly zone in Syria. There has been damn near unanimity in the opinion on Putin."" He said that, with ""Trump derangement syndrome"" growing in the party, he estimates a full 25% of Republicans are now ""twisting themselves into a pretzel"" to defend Trump saying Putin is stronger in Russia than Obama is in the US. Referencing Pence's recent comments, Mackowiak said there was ""no way in hell"" the governor would've made his ""inarguable"" statement six months ago. ""Look, Obama deserves a hell of a lot of criticism, I think he's done a hell of a lot of damage,"" he said. ""But not every criticism needs to be taken to the fullest extent. Some comparisons just aren't reasonable. There is no comparison between Putin and Obama. There just isn't."" Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College and senior contributor at The Federalist, expressed dismay with how his fellow conservatives are ""mortgaging their principles in order to keep up with Trump's increasingly bizarre statements."" ""I just have a hard time that these folks are doing anything but tying to compensate, they're trying to keep up with Trump which is almost impossible,"" he told Business Insider. ""I think conservatives have always expected a lot more from other people including [former New York City mayor and top Trump surrogate Rudy] Giuliani and Hewitt. I think no one really expects a deep understanding of geopolitics from Trump."" He referenced the earlier poll, where Putin's negatives with Republicans were cut by a dramatic amount, as proof that the rank and file is taking its queues from the party's nominee. Nichols called Trump's comparison between Putin and Obama ""completely outside the bounds of normal American political discourse."" ""I mean that is just bizarre and it's the kind of, it's the kind of thing Trump says and he ends up saddling his supporters with a comment like that and they have to figure out how to make it less toxic,"" he said. ""I'm a conservative. I've been highly critical of Obama's foreign policy for eight years. Comparing the president of the United States to a Russian dictator is just something you don't do. It's un-American."" ""And again, people like Hugh Hewitt know better,"" he continued. ""It's bad enough when Trump says it, but when Hugh Hewitt piles in behind him, Hewitt knows the difference between dictatorial control and democratic leadership. But like so many other people, he's boxed in by the nominee."" AP Photo/Evan Vucci The most 'interesting' part Trump's warmth toward Putin says a lot more than that the GOP nominee simply thinks Obama has been a weakling. ""What's more interesting is that this man is campaigning for the presidency of the United States, and that Putin, who is clearly a leader that wants America to be weaker, he has written in The New York Times that there is nothing exceptional about the United States,"" Bremmer said. ""And Putin himself has praised Trump as a genius, a brilliant guy, but I think there's a reason why."" He added: ""The fact that Trump believes that it's a good thing to be sort of closer to Putin than just about any other world leader should raise some significant questions and concerns about what kind of president he would be if elected.""",The fact that Trump believes that it's a good thing to be sort of closer to Putin than just about any other world leader should raise some significant questions and concerns about what kind of president he would be if elected.
792,"Several years ago I listened to an interview with Desmond Child, a massively successful songwriter you might not have heard of but whose music you've definitely heard. Desmond is gay and has been openly gay for a long time. He was describing working with Aerosmith on their hit ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady),"" and something really caught my attention (WARNING: this interview contains an offensive slur for transgender people): Desmond: ...Because of my success with Bon Jovi, John Kalodner -- the famous John Kalodner, legendary A&R man -- asked me if I would go up to Boston and meet Aerosmith. They had never written with an outside writer, and they were not happy to see me. They were going along with it to please John Kalodner, but they were not that happy about it. Steven (Tyler) was much more friendly, as he is, and was very generous, really, and showed me a song that they had started called ""Cruisin' for the Ladies."" I listened to that lyric, and I said, ""You know what, that's a very boring title."" And they looked at me like, ""How dare you?"" And then Steven volunteered, sheepishly, and said that when he first wrote the melody he was singing ""Dude Looks like a Lady."" It was kind of a tongue twister that sounded more like scatting. He got the idea because they had gone to a bar and had seen a girl at the end of the bar with ginormous blonde rock hair, and the girl turned around and it ended up being Vince Neil from Motley Crue. So then they started making fun of him and started saying, ""That dude looks like a lady, dude looks like a lady, dude looks like a lady."" So that's how that was born. That's the true story of how that was born. So I grabbed onto that and I said, ""No, that's the title of the song."" And they looked at me like, ""Are you kidding me?"" And then Joe (Perry) stepped in and said, ""I don't want to insult the gay community."" I said, ""Okay, I'm gay, and I'm not insulted. Let's write this song."" So I talked them into the whole scenario of a guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it's a guy. But besides that, he's gonna go with it. He says, ""My funky lady, I like it, like it, like it like that."" And so he doesn't run out of there, he stays. It's funny, because they used that song in Mrs. Doubtfire, and then it was like every four or five year old child in America was able to sing that song. It was like; do you realize this is about a tranny? (Laughing). If you think about how far back that was, it was a very daring song to sing, and everyone went with it. It's not like the polarized society we have now, because that was before gay people really started fighting for their rights and nobody cared about it and everyone thought that they could make fun of us. So they accepted the lyric, and not only that, went for it. (Laughs) I don't know if anyone has looked deep enough into the song, but it's a very accepting song, and it has a moral that says never judge a book by its cover, or who you're going to love by your lover. Songfacts: Have you ever talked to Vince Neil about this song? Desmond: Oh yeah, I told him the story. He had a good laugh. He knows that. He knows that he's the one that was paid homage to in ""Dude Looks Like a Lady."" The interview took place in 2011. The song was recorded in 1987. So Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Kiss, etc., were all working with an openly gay songwriter in the mid '80s. It really stuck with me that the band was concerned about not offending their gay audience. Or that they were aware of their gay audience. Or that they had a gay audience. Now, Child uses the term ""tranny"" in the interview, and I remember hearing that and thinking, ""Man, did you have to go there?"" I wouldn't say it destroys the interview, but it definitely makes me think less of him, because the story was funny without the slur. It wasn't necessary to establish any part of the story or his credibility. It was gratuitous, and I feel that it's important to point that out in this context, because it actually proves the point about Fox News that taking potshots at transgender folks is mean and demeaning and certainly undermines one's credibility. Fast-forward to Fox News' recent decision to use Aerosmith's song to denigrate Pfc. Chelsea Manning. As with most attempts to do this, the media got the song completely wrong: The song is not mocking a man for looking like a lady; it's describing the sex appeal of a transgender woman. It's the same old story: They've similarly misused songs by Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Tim McGraw, Maroon 5 and so forth. They don't listen to the lyrics. They don't think. They fall for a good hook, but instead of getting drawn into the music, their minds stop there. The members of Aerosmith were not out and avowed allies of the LGBTQ community in the 1980s. They were a rock group with a song co-written by an openly gay man and didn't want to offend anyone. In his 2011 memoir Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler described a sexual encounter he'd had with a man, writing, ""Gay sex just doesn't do it for me. I tried it one time when I was younger, but I just didn't dig it."" That's pretty straightforward. In the same book he went on to write that he preferred his female groupies to be freshly showered after a show. Sigh. Well, that's another post. ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"" was not some great homage to the LGBTQ community, but it was something. It was risky, and the back story is interesting, and it proves (to me, at least) that conservative pundits at Fox News and other outlets underestimate the art of most modern musicians and misunderstand their values. That's something. Sadly, Aerosmith can't stop Fox News from abusing their song, but they can speak out, like Adam Levine did, and I hope that they do. Aerosmith isn't perfect, but Fox News got this whole song wrong. Just consider the lyrics: Never judge a book by its cover, Or who you gonna love by your lover. Sayin' ""love"" put me wise to her love in disguise: She had the body of a Venus; Lord, imagine my surprise! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! That, that dude looks like a lady! Baby, let me follow you down. (Let me take a peek, dear.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Do me, do me, do me all night.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Turn the other cheek, dear.) Baby, let me follow you down. (Do me, do me, do me, do me!) Ooh, what a funky lady! Ooh, she like it, like it, like it like that! Ooh, he was a lady! Two lessons to be learned: 1) Listen to the entire song and decide for yourself what it means (don't let Fox News decide for you!); and 2) we need more artists to ""reclaim"" their music by speaking out when it's abused, even when they don't have legal standing to stop it from being abused. It still matters that they distance themselves from any misunderstandings. As a caveat, perhaps Fox News and the tea party should stick with the musical repertoires of Ted Nugent, Kid Rock and Meat Loaf. Why not give some love to those who stand by you, right?","""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"" was not some great homage to the LGBTQ community, but it was something. It was risky, and the back story is interesting, and it proves (to me, at least) that conservative pundits at Fox News and other outlets underestimate the art of most modern musicians and misunderstand their values.

794,"When I was seven, I joined hen I was seven, I joined the Brownies . At the time, becoming part of Baden-Powell’s famous organisation felt very grown up. However, when I reflect on the experience, I realise that being a Brownie is worth doing only if you start when you’re very young. It’s full of peculiar rituals, and only now that I am 31, and no one incentivises me to do anything by offering me a special badge, do I recognise how odd some of them were We were given badges for applying bandages to our ungrazed knees, remembering to keep a sewing kit in the pockets of our culottes, and successfully using a payphone to make a call. I’ll always remember the day 24 Brownies were walked into the nearest village, and each given a 10pto call our mums and tell them that we were still at Brownies, everything was fine and that we would see them in 40 minutes. From that moment, I saw telephone conversations as exciting events. They were fraught with romance, glamour and danger, and could only be approached if you were under strict supervision, unless you were a proper adult. I would have been overwhelmed if anyone had predicted that when I was an adult, I would have a portable phone for my exclusive use. I think I would have collapsed with shock if I had been told that I could use it to read books, play games, argue with strangers and identify vaguely recognisable songs that were being played in bars. If someone had said that I’d barely bother to make calls at all, I’d have told them they were a liar. But it’s true. More than three-quarters of all adults in the UK own smartphones, but 25% don’t use them to make calls Can we blame millennials for the demise of the phone call? Most of the twenty- and thirtysomethings I socialise with would rather suck Donald Trump’s toe than make or receive a call in order to have a chat. We’re in touch with each other constantly, but written communication allows us to participate in the conversation at the pace we choose. We don’t have to worry about misreading anyone’s tone when the words are laid out in black and white. However, it seems that phone-call phobia definitely isn’t confined to a single generation. Jeremy Corbyn’s aides complained that they were unable to reach their boss on the telephone this week to discuss ""traingate"" because he was busy making jam Perhaps it’s not the phone calls themselves we object to, but the feeling of being ambushed by them Many millennials struggle with mental health, and we’ve been dubbed the ""anxious generation"" . As an anxiety sufferer, nothing fills me with dread and terror like a phone call from a withheld number. The trouble is that the issue exacerbates itself. Because we don’t call for chats, I assume that whenever anyone does try to reach me on the telephone, it’s because of a bad, sad, serious emergency and I need to be reached urgently, possibly for a telling off. So I fling the phone from my hand, as if it’s a live snake, and then get a voicemail from someone who was just ringing for a catch-up. ""But it’s not urgent, we can just do it on WhatsApp."" Perhaps it’s not phone calls themselves we object to, but the feeling of being ambushed by them. One worker in their 20s told the Wall Street Journal: ""Calling someone without emailing first can make it seem as though you’re prioritising your needs over theirs."" That’s right. The millennial attitude towards phone calls is actually about manners. We’ve grown up with so many methods of communication available to us, and we’ve gravitated towards the least intrusive ones because we know how it feels to be digitally prodded on a range of different channels. Speaking on the telephone is an event, and we don’t want to avoid it – we just need to be sure that both parties have a chance to prepare for it. We want a chance to compose and edit our thoughts, in the way we do when we’re writing them down. There is an element of mindfulness involved too. Thanks to our phones, we’re never doing nothing, and if we’re surprised by a phone call we might struggle to give the caller our full attention. If we know when to expect it, we can at least try to focus in a way that we’re not always capable of during other moments of our lives. It’s fair to say that young people can still see the value of a phone call, but perhaps we understand it as something serious and significant, to be used in much more specific contexts and shared with a select group of people. We all have an inner circle who would be allowed to interrupt us for a chat when we’re in the middle of making jam. Everyone else will have to make do with a message.","One worker in their 20s told the Wall Street Journal: ""Calling someone without emailing first can make it seem as though you’re prioritising your needs over theirs."""

803,"Even before he took an NFL snap, there were many who believed that Tim Tebow might be better suited as a fullback or H-back-type player if he wanted to have a career in the league. Once Tebow was drafted and he struggled as a signal-caller – he couldn’t make decisions quick enough and he was inaccurate – the calls for him to switch positions, or maybe try his hand in the Canadian Football League, only grew louder. But Tebow refused. It was quarterback or nothing. So nothing it is; Tebow spent training camp with the New England Patriots in 2013 and the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015, but the 2010 first-round pick hasn’t played a meaningful snap in the league since 2012. So now Tebow has turned his attention to baseball. He hasn’t played the game since his junior year of high school over a decade ago, but he’s been working out on the diamond, and feels he’s ready to try out for teams. On Tuesday, multiple reporters tweeted that Tebow will hold a showcase in Los Angeles on Aug. 30, and there’s enough curiosity in what the now-29-year-old Tebow can do that more than 20 Major League Baseball teams are confirmed to be sending personnel to watch the workout. Tebow is of course willing to pursue whatever he’d like, and if he can find folks willing to indulge him, all the better. But as noted by The MMQB’s Albert Breer, it’s curious that after refusing to consider other positions and options with the sport (we assume) is his first love, Tebow is now willing to grind it out in baseball. If he’s signed, Tebow isn’t just going to jump onto a Major League roster; he’ll be in the minors, the antithesis of glamour. In the NFL, games are played in front of 65,000 fans, teams travel to road games on chartered planes and have police escort their buses from hotel to stadium. That’s not life in the minors. Tebow is from Florida and played in the SEC with the Florida Gators, so let’s say the Tampa Bay Rays sign him. Their advanced Single-A team is the Charlotte Stone Crabs in Port Charlotte, Fla., in the Florida State League. That means traveling all over his home state, to cities like Bradenton and Dunedin, and the biggest stadium is 11,000 seats for the Tampa Yankees. Assume the Rays place Tebow with their Double-A team, the Montgomery (Ala.) Biscuits. The Biscuits are in the Southern League. You know the other teams in the Southern League? The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Lookouts, the Biloxi (Miss.) Shuckers and the Pensacola (Fla.) Blue Wahoos, among other teams. Again, biggest stadium is 11,000 seats. And the bus rides are a lot longer. Keep in mind, too, those leagues wrap up their respective regular seasons by Sept. 5, though maybe he will play in the Arizona Fall league. For the teams interested in Tebow, signing him is worth it if you believe that he’ll help boost attendance. That makes business sense. Maybe Tebow is prepared for the reality of life as a minor leaguer. It seems odd that he wouldn’t change positions in football but now he’s all in on a baseball career that will almost certainly start in some small city, in front of small crowds, with a paltry per diem as he spends hours and hours on a bus between series.","he’s been working out on the diamond, and feels he’s ready to try out for teams"

809,"Episode 1 of Dope Grannies, a video series on senior citizens and marijuana. Number of medical- and recreational-marijuana dispensaries in the U.S.: 5,000 Number of medical-marijuana dispensaries in California: 1,200 Number of medical-marijuana dispensaries owned and run by a retired Catholic-school principal who’s also an ordained minister? Zero. But if Sue Taylor gets her wish, that number will jump to one. The impeccably dressed 69-year-old may become just the latest example of how wide-reaching the debate over weed legalization is shaping up to be. In her case, she is making an aggressive case to convince seniors to use marijuana to deal with all the ailments that come along with being old. And just where is all this furor lighting up? Berkeley, of course. Saying she’s never tried a blunt in her life, the self-styled ""cannabis evangelist"" is one of six finalists vying for a chance to open the town’s fourth legal medical-marijuana dispensary — and the first in the state (and the country) catering specifically to senior citizens. ""I am the least likely person in the world to be doing this,"" she says. A mother of three, she says she first started taking edibles four years ago to deal with back pain, swallowing 1/8th of a cannabis gummy. Convinced by its effectiveness, she has been hitting local senior centers, nursing homes and churches, chatting up the pain-easing value of pot that seniors might ignore. Critics, of course, continue to say that spreading marijuana use — which is now legal for medical use in more than 20 states — carries a number of risks, including increasing criminal behavior and influencing teens. Brook Lowe, treasurer of Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana, points to the fact that the Food and Drug Administration has not recognized marijuana as a safe or effective treatment for any medical conditions. What’s more, few neighborhoods are crazy about having a dispensary in the ’hood. But Taylor has a convincing spiel for her audience of seniors: She used to consider marijuana a hard drug, but she now sees it as medicinal and full of curative appeal, combating aches and pains, loss of appetite and insomnia. With the average senior prescribed between 14 and 18 prescription drugs per year, Taylor says, cannabis could cut that number drastically. An African-American with roots in Louisiana, she says her generation was raised to ""follow the rules."" She also says convincing elderly African-Americans has been a particular challenge; after years of seeing young lives upended by the drug trade and the uneven policing around it, the Black community has been slow to seek opportunity in the multibillion-dollar legal-marijuana industry. But Taylor half-jokingly has a thought on that: ""Why should white folks be the only ones to profit?"" For her own dispensary, which she would call iCANN, Taylor wants to convert a dingy, old, 3,900-square-foot space on Sacramento Street to a gleaming shop that not only stocks marijuana salves, tinctures and low-salt and low-sugar edibles for grannies with diabetes or high blood pressure, but also serve as a holistic health center. But first, she needs that permit, which has her filling out the lengthy paperwork and learning city ordinances. Still, a spiritual calm surrounds the ordained minister, who believes her connection to cannabis was ""a spark of the divine.""","With the average senior prescribed between 14 and 18 prescription drugs per year, Taylor says, cannabis could cut that number drastically."

This unorthodox -- and very pricey -- take on Da Vinci's classic was rendered over 500 years later and quite a ways across the globe. ""The Last Supper"" we're admiring is by Chinese contemporary artist Zeng Fanzhi, an art icon known for documenting the psychological toll that his country's economic reform has had on its citizens. Made in 2001, the painting was part of Fanzhi's ""Mask"" series, which examines selfhood and deception in modern China. Instead of traditional religious figures, the painting depicts twelve masked Young Pioneers dining on watermelon. Most of the sitters are wearing red scarves, symbolic of Communism, but the Pioneer in Judas' seat wears yellow. ""The golden yellow tie represents money, and in essence, Western capitalism,"" the artist explained to Sotheby's. The work alludes to the first signs of western influence in China's economy, an influence that would proceed to transform the nation throughout the 1990s.

816,"Melania Trump will soon learn that a picture is worth a whole lot more than 1,000 words once it's posted to Twitter. Though the new FLOTUS doesn't live in the White House, on Wednesday she took a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture with Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After posting a photograph from her trip to Twitter, users on the very outspoken platform began to highlight the Trump family's rocky relationship with race and  noticed a hilariously perfect facial reaction lurking in the background. According to yesterday's White House pool report, Trump and Netanyahu were given a tour by David Skorton, Secretary of the Smithsonian, and Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Trump tweeted the following photograph of the four looking at one of the exhibits, and described the visit as an honor. It was an honor to visit the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History @NMAAHC pic.twitter.com/rai8keSoEN — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) February 16, 2017 At first glance, the photo looks pretty normal, but because this is Twitter, the image was closely dissected and a man behind the group who appears to be rolling his eyes quickly became the star. @FLOTUS @NMAAHC This dude is totally rolling his eyes. pic.twitter.com/v5GS4e4w3q — Matthew Verkamp (@MatthewVerkamp) February 16, 2017 The image is significant because in the past the Trump family has come under fire several times before for their ignorance regarding the black community.  Back in January, the president made a controversial move by targeting Civil Rights icon and U.S. Representative for Georgia, John Lewis on Twitter, claiming he is ""all talk and no action or results."" Mor recently, Trump made an embarrassing speech for Black History Month, in which he appeared to imply that human rights leader, Frederick Douglass, was still alive. Thus, the sight of a black man gazing towards the sky during FLOTUS's visit to the historical museum is kind of perfect. Between the man's face and the Trump family's poor track record with the black community, it's no surprise the Twitter users had a lot to say. @FLOTUS this guy's face says it all 😂 pic.twitter.com/Ri4DJL2tKw — Queen Elizabeth (@izzabell_wins) February 16, 2017 @FLOTUS getting rid of the ACA disproportionately disadvantages black women- do something for your people.

His clothing also fits the description of a Secret Service agent, and in the photograph below he appears to be wearing an earpiece. But no matter who the man is, there's no denying the photo sparked an important discussion.

821,"A new app from Apple coaches you through breathing exercises, but do these exercises really help reduce stress? This week, Apple announced a number of new features for the Apple Watch, including an app due out this fall called Breathe, which will ""encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction,"" the company said in a statement. The app will guide users though a timed breathing session, lasting 1 to 5 minutes. The watch can track a user's heart rate, and so at the end of a session, users will see a summary of their heart rate data, Apple said. Although some experts recommend up to 20 minutes of breathing exercises a day, just 5 minutes of breathing exercises can help people feel calmer and refreshed, said Nancy Harazduk, director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Studies suggest that deep-breathing exercises may reduce certain types of stress and anxiety, and can temporarily lower blood pressure. But many of these studies have been small, so more research is needed to learn more about the exact benefits of deep-breathing exercises, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Deep breathing is a type of relaxation technique that is intended to counteract the body's normal response to stress, the ""fight or flight"" response. Deep breathing lowers heart rate and reduces levels of stress hormones, according to the NCCIH. And because deep breathing dilates blood vessels, it can also lower blood pressure, Harazduk said . In addition, when you breathe deeply, you take in more oxygen, which may help improve your mental concentration and release endorphins that increase feelings of well-being, she told Live Science . Focusing on breathing can also take your mind off stressful thoughts. ""One of the ways of letting go thoughts of anxiety or stress is by focusing on our breathing,"" Harazduk said. [11 Tips to Lower Stress] Studies show that deep breathing and other relaxation techniques may reduce anxiety in people undergoing certain medical procedures, such as breast biopsies or dental treatment, the NCCIH said. A 2013 study from researchers in South Korea found that burn patients who practiced breathing exercises had lower scores on measures of pain and anxiety when doctors treated their burns, compared with people who didn't practice the breathing exercises. Deep breathing might also help with some day-to-day stresses. A 2013 study from researchers at Tufts University found that people who had anxiety about taking math tests performed better on the tests, and reported feeling calmer, if they practiced a breathing exercise beforehand. However, breathing exercises by themselves may not be the best treatment for people with generalized anxiety disorder, a mental health condition in which people find it hard to control their anxiety, according to the NCCIH. Studies suggest that people with generalized anxiety disorder who are treated with psychotherapy do better than those who practice relaxation techniques alone. And although breathing exercises can lower blood pressure in the short term, it's not certain how long these effects last. The Food and Drug Administration approved a device called Resperate, which helps people slow their breathing, to reduce stress and lower blood pressure. A review study conducted by the British Hypertension Society, which included nearly 500 patients, found that the device did lower blood pressure, by about 3.7 millimeters of mercury for systolic and 2.5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, on average. But the longest-duration study in the review was nine weeks. The Society said that, because the effect was small and the studies were short, it could not recommend Resperate at this time. Deep-breathing techniques should not be used as a replacement for conventional care, or to postpone seeing a doctor for a health problem, the NCCIH said. The Breathe app will be available in the fall with the next update to the Apple Watch operating system, called watchOS 3.",Deep breathing lowers heart rate and reduces levels of stress hormones

825,"It's becoming more common not to believe in God or organized religion these days, so it would only be natural for a few atheists to have made their way to Congress, right? Below, we've managed to cram all of the atheists serving on Capitol Hill into one important GIF: Yeah, there isn't a single admitted atheist currently in Congress. For purposes of demonstration, however, the cat can represent former Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), who left Congress in 2012 as its only avowed atheist. Much like the flying feline, he fell a bit short of his mark after having his legs taken out from under him by another Democrat, thanks to California's ""top-two"" primary election system. A few months after retiring, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also announced his nonbeliever status, a declaration he made more than 25 years after coming out as the first openly gay member of Congress. That Frank felt more comfortable going public with his sexuality in 1987 than he did with his secular beliefs at any point during his House career says a lot about the stigma surrounding atheism in electoral politics. In 2011, Herb Silverman of the Secular Coalition of America told the Guardian that his group was aware of 27 members of Congress other than Stark ""that have no belief in God."" It's unclear who they were, or are, but none of them -- perhaps except Frank -- have since decided to speak out. Atheists may have thought they had a new congressional ally last year, when Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won a seat in Arizona's 9th Congressional District. Sinema's staff has since regularly pushed back against the ""nonbeliever"" label that had initially been ascribed to her, instead clarifying that the congresswoman prefers a ""secular approach."" Though Sinema ""does not consider herself a member of any faith community,"" her communications director has said, she ""is a student of all cultures in her community."" The political picture looks no brighter for atheists in state legislatures, many of which have laws barring nonbelievers from holding public office. By most counts, there's only one atheist currently in office: Nebraska state Rep. Ernie Chambers, an independent who has not shied away from his secular views and belief in the separation of church and state. The total lack of atheist congressional representation is somewhat surprising in the broader context of nationwide faith and non-faith trends. The latest Pew poll on religion found that out of nearly 20 percent of Americans who call themselves unaffiliated, 2.4 percent identify as atheists. Another 3.3 percent are agnostics, and about 14 percent described their religious beliefs as ""nothing in particular."" More than a quarter of those ""nothing in particular"" respondents said they don't believe in God or a universal spirit. While other polls have similarly shown a growth in secular beliefs as the unaffiliated trend away from organized religion, trust of atheists remains a key hurdle to getting those views represented in public office. A poll taken during election season last year found that only 54 percent of Americans would vote for a ""well-qualified"" atheist presidential candidate. While this was the highest total since Gallup began asking the question in 1958, atheism proved the biggest negative influence on a hypothetical candidate's viability, with fewer respondents saying they would be willing to vote for an atheist than either a gay or a Muslim candidate. Another survey taken in 2012 found that 50 percent of Americans believe atheism is ""threatening"" to them. On Wednesday, the Center for Humanist Activism launched a political action committee, hoping to turn the tide. The Freethought Equality Fund PAC is being billed as the first non-theist PAC with a full-time paid staff. The group's organizers plan to provide financial support to humanist, atheist and agnostic candidates at all levels of government, and will support candidates who identify with a religion, so long as they are committed to protecting the separation of church and state and defending the civil liberties of secular Americans. At a press conference on Wednesday, Maggie Ardiente, Freethought's director of development and communications, explained why the group is concerned about a political system that has been monopolized by religious lawmakers. ""Whether we recognize it or not, Americans are held captive to the will of religious right leaders who remind us of our inferior position by using the power of government to enforce laws that put truth claims about religion in front of us at every turn,"" Ardiente said. ""We have to spend our tax dollars on schools in most states where educators refuse to teach that the evidence massively supports a theory of evolution that unites everything we know about biology.""",there isn't a single admitted atheist

""Even without complete knowledge of biological mechanisms [of how alcohol causes cancer], the epidemiological evidence can support the judgment that alcohol causes cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and breast."" ""There is strong evidence that alcohol causes cancer at seven sites in the body and probably others,"" Jennie Connor, the lead author on the journal report, said, according to the. ""Even without complete knowledge of biological mechanisms [of how alcohol causes cancer], the epidemiological evidence can support the judgment that alcohol causes cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and breast."" The real bummer with the findings is that, according to Connor, there's enough evidence to conclude that drinking alcohol is a direct cause of cancer — not just a factor among a cocktail of symptoms. Not only that, but the cancer risk level rises the more you drink. Even drinking in moderation may not make a difference — therefore, Connor said, alcohol awareness campaigns should focus on all drinkers, not just those who drink heavily. ""The highest risks are associated with the heaviest drinking but a considerable burden is experienced by drinkers with low to moderate consumption, due to the distribution of drinking in the population,"" Connor said. Last year, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that drinking a daily glass of wine actually increased women's likelihood of developing breast cancer. ""For women who have never smoked, risk of alcohol-related cancers (mainly breast cancer) increases even within the range of up to one alcoholic drink a day,"" the study concluded. On the upside, Connor found some evidence that giving up alcohol could reverse the risk of some cancers, with better results the longer the subject abstained. If the evidence is correct, maybe it's a good opportunity to start cutting back.","""There is strong evidence that alcohol causes cancer at seven sites in the body and probably others,"""
828,"There are two major things happening in the mobile world right now, and they both favor Apple. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are about to launch, and some carriers already expect record sales . Meanwhile, Apple’s main rival is dealing with a massive Galaxy Note 7 problem that’s been getting worse and worse for the company with each passing day. We were so busy focusing on Apple’s announcements last week, which came just a few days after Samsung announced its unprecedented Galaxy Note 7 recall, that we missed Apple’s brilliant reaction to the exploding Galaxy Note 7. Are you ready for it? There was none. Apple didn't make fun of Samsung in any form or fashion for the terrible design flaw that forced it to recall 2.5 million smartphones. Think about that for a second. Apple didn’t take a single free hit at Samsung. It didn’t make any jokes when presenting the battery improvements of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. And if there was a place to laugh at Samsung, that would have been it. Instead, Apple pretended like there was no Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall disaster to mock. And it showed a lot of class given that exploding phones are no joke. These potentially harmful incidents happen to every smartphone maker, Apple included. The scale is a lot smaller though, as it’s very rare to hear that an iPhone’s battery exploded. Even better, Apple actually pretended there was no Samsung. Or Android. It didn’t even compare iOS to Android anymore. Tim Cook’s iPhone 7 event was only about Apple. Motorola, however, took advantage of Samsung’s vulnerability just as Apple chose not to kick a Samsung when it’s down. ""At Moto, our priority is safety first. Unlike some manufacturers, we adhere to the highest standards in quality and testing of all our batteries,"" Motorola said in some marketing materials Now think about what Samsung would’ve done instead. Samsung called Apple out for killing the headphone jack even before the iPhone 7 was official. And it did it while announcing the Galaxy Note 7. It constantly makes fun of Apple’s iPhone in its own events and in ads. I’m willing to bet a few rare Pokemon that Samsung would have made the most of an iPhone recall due to faulty batteries to promote its safe Galaxy alternatives, and hit Apple in the process.

Getting to the Red Planet might be half the battle, but staying happy and comfortable there is also a serious challenge. Earlier this week, NASA announced it was offering $5,000 for the best ideas on how to improve social interaction, exercise, food and other necessities on a future Mars base. Stuck on a cold, barren planet with the same four to six people for two years, little things like home-cooked meals and emails from family members could be vital to keeping astronauts productive. ""Our experience is that people really start to care about that stuff,"" Kim Binsted told NBC News. She is the principal investigator on the current Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) mission, which looks at how people react to being stuck in a tiny habitat for months at a time. Food matters. Comfort matters. Being connected to the Internet matters. So how do we make those things work for people who will be on average 141 million miles away?

""Those astronauts, for their psychological well-being, would probably like to see some HD video from home,"" Don Cornwell, director of NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program, told NBC News. In 2013, his team proved that lasers could be used instead of radio waves to transmit data almost a quarter of a million miles to the moon.

Embed Realistic Martian colony set up on Hawaiian volcano 2:21 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog More importantly, it allows for high upload speeds. With the radio-frequency communications used now, only simple commands can be sent past low Earth orbit, enough to give a rover directions but not much else. The laser demonstration showed that 20 megabits per second could be beamed up to the moon. That could easily handle streaming ""Game of Thrones"" or a broadcast of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For astronauts spending months on a cold, lifeless planet, that is no small deal. Messages from family, sports broadcasts and more could help stave off feelings of isolation. The problem is that sending data to Mars will be about a million times more difficult than sending data to the moon — which was about a million times more difficult than sending data to orbiting satellites, said Cornwell. In 2020, NASA is scheduled to launch a similar test to Mars orbit that could achieve download speeds of 250 megabits per second and upload speeds of a few kilobits per second. It's not quite fast enough for Netflix — but there won't be astronauts on Mars by then anyway, so NASA has time to improve its technology. The hope is for the future inhabitants of Mars to be able to watch YouTube, browse family photos on social media and more. (But no video-chatting on Skype, sadly. Even lasers can't transmit faster than the speed of light, meaning that signals would take eight to 46 minutes to go from Mars to Earth and back to Mars.) Some of that bandwidth will be committed to scientific data. But don't be surprised if the astronauts get plenty of it for their own personal use. ""I think the astronauts would be very powerful in negotiating that,"" Cornwell said. ""If they were going to spend two years away on a mission, I would think they would have a lot of leverage when it comes to staying connected."" Space Furniture Compared to rockets and rovers, a table and chair don't seem too complicated. But on Mars, where gravity is around 62 percent lower than on Earth, it's not that simple. A gentle nudge could send a coffee cup flying off a table. Leaning too far could cause people on Mars to tumble out of their chairs. ""Nobody has really put too much effort into researching the effects of partial gravity on everyday things like furniture,"" Alex Schmidt, a Rice University engineering student, told NBC News. Less than two weeks ago, Schmidt and his team unveiled their own designs for a Mars-ready table and chair. They thought about adding bumpers to the table, but instead covered it with a high-friction neoprene that keeps items in place. They made the chair to be easily adjustable so that its occupant's feet are always on the ground, which turns out to be enough to ensure they won't fall out. The table's height can also be adjusted. Furniture on Mars needs to serve multiple purposes. A table can't just be a table — it needs to serve as a normal desk, a work table for people to stand around, and a place to eat dinner. There just isn't enough room on a spaceship or tiny habitat to store multiple pieces of furniture or even spare parts. It also needs to be light. Right now, it costs NASA around $10,000 to send a pound of cargo into Earth's orbit. Those costs could go down by the time a manned mission to Mars takes place. Still, keeping the furniture's weight down was a top priority for the Rice team. They were helped by the fact that lower gravity means less strength is needed to keep furniture from collapsing. High-grade aluminum and the same memory foam used in professional race cars were used to build the chair, which when broken down can fit into a 2-by-2-foot square box. The furniture was also designed with ease of assembly in mind, including color coding and parts that only fit into each other. (Unlike with Ikea furniture, astronauts can't order replacement parts if they break a chair — although they may be able to make them on a 3-D printer someday.) The furniture might not be found in hip Soho lofts anytime soon, but the team did consider aesthetics. ""We asked ourselves, 'If you were trapped on a habitat for six months, would you mind looking at it?'"" Schmidt said. ""We definitely tried to make it look nice."" Cooking on Another Planet On Mars, you can't order pad thai from down the street. Food will have to last through takeoff, the entire Mars mission, and the trip back. That requires a shelf life of at least four years — even more if NASA decides to send up the food and habitat ahead of time. The first people on Mars will almost certainly have the prepackaged meals that astronauts eat today on the International Space Station. Chances are they will also spend time in the kitchen. ""If you have pre-prepared lasagna, it's always going to be lasagna,"" Binsted told NBC News. ""But if you have noodles, tomato powder, freeze-dried cheese and freeze-dried meat, they can be combined in a bunch of different ways."" Not only would shipping up ingredients in bulk let astronauts create more variety in their diets, she said, it would also weigh less because of reduced packaging. A previous HI-SEAS study found that volunteers far preferred food that was cooked over prepackaged meals. Over a four-month period, they discovered quite a few favorite dishes, including Moroccan beef tagine, filled with freeze-dried beef, dehydrated bell peppers and a healthy pinch of cumin. Like most people, the HI-SEAS volunteers also liked a little variety in their diets. That's important because astronauts on extended space missions are at risk of losing bone and muscle mass, something that could hamper their ability to do their jobs. The nutrients that astronauts get from a varied diet will be essential to keeping them healthy. Another reason why cooking on Mars is a good idea? The astronauts will have very rigid schedules with very little opportunity for creativity, making the kitchen a space to break from the routine. It will also give them something to look forward to. ""Early explorers in Antarctica, even if they were just eating seal meat, took every opportunity to celebrate special events,"" Binsted said. Not that a Mars habitat will be a four-star restaurant. Fried chicken is out of the question: Splattering oil in a low-gravity environment can be messy business, and any kind of fire is strictly off limits. But the HI-SEAS test subjects tried out plenty of appetizing dishes ranging from breakfast sandwiches to chocolate desserts. There are also negatives to cooking from scratch: Anyone who has zapped a microwavable burrito at the end of the day knows that sometimes people just don't have the energy or time to cook. And while bulk ingredients might weigh less, they require heavy equipment to cook and other gear to ventilate the habitat. In the end, the solution could be a mix of prepackaged meals, ingredients for cooking and even material for astronauts to grow their own food. This week, NASA administrator Charles Bolden said the agency was on track to put someone on Mars in the 2030s. Hopefully they will be able to sit back in their memory foam chair, dig into a bowl of Moroccan beef tagine, and read this article with their speedy Internet connection.","NASA announced it was offering $5,000 for the best ideas on how to improve social interaction, exercise, food and other necessities on a future Mars base."

856,"Jamie Dimon is mad. He's mad -- like so many Americans -- about the state of public education in many American cities. Especially in Detroit. ""This is probably one of the biggest disasters, Not just Detroit. A lot of inner city schools in America,"" Dimon told CNNMoney in an exclusive interview in Detroit. ""Americans should understand that 50%, or something like, of the kids in inner-city schools, often poor and often minority, don't graduate. And the ones that do, don't necessarily have the skills to get a job. That is the biggest disgrace in this country,"" Dimon lamented. ""We should be ringing an alarm bell on every hilltop and every mountain top and saying this shouldn't be allowed."" In a separate event for a group of entrepreneurs in Detroit, Dimon pointed out that there were more than 5 million open jobs in the U.S. right now, near a record high. With some 8 million unemployed Americans, the problem is a skills gap. Dimon argues the failure to educate America's youth with the skills needed to get these jobs is the ultimate societal failure. As CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Dimon spent the day in Detroit recently to meet with entrepreneurs and small-business owners and see the impact of a $100 million commitment his bank has made to the revival of the city. The bank on Wednesday announced an additional $4 million towards an initiative (along with the Skillman Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Ford Motor Company Fund) to connect 10,000 Detroit high school students to career education and work experiences over the next three years. ""JPMorgan was founded in Detroit...We're the biggest bank here, consumer, commercial, large corporate. So it's an important town to us,"" Dimon told CNNMoney. ""We've watched Detroit become a train wreck for 20 years."" But when Dimon met Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan following his 2014 election, he started to view the city in a different light. ""This mayor is just practical, and thoughtful and not sanctimonious, and not ideological."" In Duggan, Dimon saw a mayor who said: ""Let's turn the lights on and get sanitation better. Let's rehab some abandoned homes. Let's get businesses back in town. We said we're all in."" JP Morgan is two years into a $100 million investment in Detroit. Here's where some of the money is going: -- $50 million to finance the development of commercial, retail and mixed-income housing in Detroit -- $6.5 million to fund loans to minority-owned small businesses through an Entrepreneurs of Color Fund in partnership with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation -- $4 million to preserve affordable housing -- $1.5 million towards job training and summer youth employment Detroit has a long way to go The city may be on the mend, but after becoming the biggest American city ever to go bankrupt -- Detroit still has a long way to go. The Motor City is still battered and bruised. Unemployment here is about twice the national average and some 30,000 homes remain abandoned. To say the financial crisis -- and rampant foreclosures -- hit Detroit hard is an understatement. And many here still point their finger squarely at Wall Street and its biggest banks. ""JP Morgan obviously made mistakes,"" Dimon told CNNMoney. ""But to me, we were also steadfast. If you talk about JP Morgan, we were here in the darkest moments for everybody at all time. We didn't run. We didn't hide. All the big banks rolled over trillions of dollars of loans when the market place wasn't willing to. But we've made mistakes. We try to admit the mistakes. We learn from them and move on. And we've paid a heavy price for them."" For city to rise, focus on public schools In Detroit, Dimon sees a city that could rise again. But he admits, that cannot happen unless Detroit's public schools thrive. The Detroit Public School district is in utter disrepair and the bankruptcy that relieved the city of $7 billion in debt missed Detroit's schools completely. The Detroit public school system was not included in the city's financial reorganization. The school district, with more than $500 million in operating debt according to the Michigan governor's office, is on track to run out of money to pay its teachers and staff by the end of June. In protest, many of the teachers have joined sick-outs closing down a majority of the district's 97 schools, sometimes for days at a time. The state-appointed emergency manager, though, assured teachers in May they will be paid for the full school year. It's not just a salary fight. Many of the school buildings in Detroit are outdated, dilapidated and physically decaying. Dimon sees the problem on a national scale. ""Among those people not graduating, there might be a Steve Jobs or Barack Obama. We'll never know,"" he said. The National Center for Education Statistics data show low income students are five times more likely to drop out of high school than high income students. High school graduates make about $630,000 more over their lifetimes than non-high school graduates. Community college degree that doesn't lead to a job isn't worth it Dimon acknowledged the immediate need is ""the right curriculum, the right teachers, the right help and the right money"" but in education he sees a bigger need -- paying more attention to vocational education in areas where the jobs are. ""Having a community college degree, and you get out and have no job, is a sense of hopelessness,"" he said. ""They have to work together with local businesses to make sure that what they are being taught is what the businesses need."" Mayor Duggan bluntly says there is no way his city can turnaround without it. ""Everything about reducing poverty is bringing in businesses and getting our young people educated and having the skills to work. If you don't do both things, we won't fundamentally change the trajectory in the city,"" he said in an interview with CNNMoney in Detroit. So with the schools in such disrepair -- why is JP Morgan betting $100 million on Detroit? Dimon sees this city's comeback in it's ""entrepreneurial spirit"" noting in a recent op-ed the 61,000 small businesses (50,000 of them minority-owned) as part and parcel to returning Detroit to a thriving metropolis. Dimon calls it the ""job"" -- the responsibility -- of institutions, including big business, to partner with local government to create an environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. He points to research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute which found 58% of consumer spending in Detroit happens at small businesses -- compared to an average of 36% in 14 other cities the Institute studied. Duggan is quick to point out the $100 million JPMorgan has committed to Detroit is not charity. ""Business is in business to make money and I'm not under any illusion. I think JPMorgan is gonna make a lot of money off of Detroit because they're invested in the city at a time is down and they're gonna be a central part of the growth,"" the mayor said. ""I bet Jamie Dimon would be the first to tell you he expects JPMorgan Chase to benefit significantly from Detroit's recovery."" Asked if he sees Detroit as a smart investment, Dimon told CNNMoney ""I hope so. If it doesn't work I'll feel far worse for the people of Detroit than I do for JPMorgan. But yes I hope it can be a little part of turning around this great city."" -- Chris Isidore and Heather Long contributed to this article.","""Americans should understand that 50%, or something like, of the kids in inner-city schools, often poor and often minority, don't graduate.

If so, some of the company’s staff say there’s a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a money-making business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately — the coffee chain As a money-making business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately — the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company’s hourly employees in the U.S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren’t getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain’s Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives; some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. ID: 9323172 If you have information or tips, you can contact this reporter via email at venessa.wong@buzzfeed.com ID: 9323177 It’s an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for bare-minimum pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff — ""partners,"" in Starbucks lingo — about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a store-by-store basis. ""We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,"" said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks’ Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks’ Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are ""historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor."" The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new ""forecasting tool"" that would ""adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business."" ""‘Reducing overspending’ seems like good business sense,"" Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company’s GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. ""Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,"" one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. ""The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I’ve ever experienced,"" said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months.

It’s hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting.

Over five years, and I’ve never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent..with the occasional ‘You wanna go home early today?’ But now it’s ‘You have to go home, we are way over on labor.’ ...

859,"In a quiet forest in Lithuania, some of the most harrowing events of the 20th century took place. Now, 70 years later, high-tech imaging techniques have helped shine a light onto the dark – yet profoundly inspirational – story of what took place there. An international team of archaeologists has uncovered a 35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape a Nazi massacre site in Lithuania's Ponar forest, a site where 100,000 people had been killed. Researchers from Israel, Lithuania, Canada, and the US used electrical resistivity tomography to avoid disturbing the bodies in the mass graves, an imaging technique commonly used in mineral and oil exploration that shows up changes in electrical properties underground. Their imaging showed that a tunnel started in a pit, used to imprison the captives, and led to an open space in the forest. ""To find a little glimmer of hope within the dark hole of Ponar is very important as humans. The tunnel shows that even when the time was so black, there was yearning for life within that,"" Jon Seligman, an archaeologist with Israel’s antiquities authority who participated in the expedition, told Associated Press. Ponar forest, known today as Paneriai, is found 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the city center of Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital city. The Nazis invaded Lithuania in 1941, freeing them from the repressive Soviet regime that had occupied them just one year previous. While the invasion was initially welcomed, it quickly turned sour with the establishment of Jewish ghettos and mass executions. Ponar forest was chosen as an execution site because of its seclusion, its proximity to Vilnius, and its railway station. In total, around 100,000 people were slaughtered, including Russian prisoners of war, Polish intellectuals, communists, and over 70,000 Jewish people. That's 95 percent of Lithuania's Jewish population. However, Soviet troops began to advance on the area once again in 1943. In a desperate bid to cover the traces of their mass killings, the Nazis brought 80 Jewish and Soviet prisoners to Ponar forest from the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland. Under the watch of armed guards, with their legs shackled, the prisoners were forced to dig up the mass graves and burn the human remains. This group of people, known as the ""Burning Brigade"", were forced to sleep in one of the pits used for the killings. Over a period of three months, some of them secretly dug an underground tunnel from this pit using spoons and their bare hands. On April 15, 1944, the final night of Passover, 40 of the prisoners filed off their chains and fled down the tunnel. The majority were caught and subsequently killed by the Nazi guards. However, 11 managed to escape the forest and reach partisan forces, to whom they told their story. We only know about the vast majority of the horrors from Ponar forest thanks to these 11 people and their unimaginably courageous escape plan. ""As an Israeli whose family originated in Lithuania, I was reduced to tears on the discovery of the escape tunnel at Ponar,"" Seligman said in a statement. ""The exposure of the tunnel enables us to present, not only the horrors of the Holocaust, but also the yearning for life.""",35-meter (115-foot) long tunnel that Jewish prisoners secretly dug with spoons and their bare hands to escape

862,"Have you ever felt that your cat or dog can see something you don’t? Well, you may be right, according to a new study. Cats, dogs, and other mammals are thought to see in ultraviolet light, which opens up a whole different world than the one we see, the study explains. Seeing the World in Ultraviolet (UV) Light UV light is the wave length beyond the visible light from red to violet that humans can see. Humans have a lens that blocks UV from reaching the retina. It was previously thought that most mammals have lenses similar to humans. Scientists studied the lenses of dead mammals, including cats, dogs, monkeys, pandas, hedgehogs, and ferrets. By researching how much light passes through the lens to reach the retina, they concluded that some mammals previously thought not to be able to see UV actually can. ""Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do,"" Ron Douglas, the study leader and a biologist at City University London, England, told LiveScience. What purpose does being able to see UV light serve for animals such as reindeer, rodents, and other mammals?

864,"In 2015 NASA announced that they found definitive evidence of liquid water on Mars. But while obtaining a physical sample would revolutionize science, it’s forbidden by international law. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prevents every nation on Earth from sending a mission, robot or human, close to a water source in the fear of contaminating it with life from Earth [PDF]. In its 140-million-mile journey from Earth to Mars, it’s possible that Curiosity has carried harmful microbes all the way from home. Even though NASA tries its best to sterilize all space-traveling equipment before launch by subjecting it to intense ultraviolet light, it still might harbor microbial hitchhikers. In theory, NASA could turn up the heat and radiation to a level pretty much guaranteed to destroy any microbial life—but that could also end up wiping out the rover’s internal systems. ""In order to be completely sterile, they'd have to use really powerful ionizing radiation or heat, both of which would damage the electronics,"" University of New South Wales astrobiologist Malcolm Walter told Fairfax Media. ""So they go as far as they dare."" Another issue that would prevent Curiosity from investigating the water source is the terrain itself. The slopes where the streaks formed are steep and therefore difficult to navigate. Future Mars rovers could be designed with this hurdle in mind, and they could also come equipped with DNA sequencers to test for life or 3D-printing capabilities to build smaller bots with little to no chance of being contaminated.

866,"If and when we finally encounter aliens, they probably won’t look like little green men, or spiny insectoids. It’s likely they won’t be biological creatures at all, but rather, advanced robots that outstrip our intelligence in every conceivable way. While scores of philosophers, scientists and futurists have prophesied the rise of artificial intelligence and the impending singularity, most have restricted their predictions to Earth. Fewer thinkers—outside the realm of science fiction, that is—have considered the notion that artificial intelligence is already out there, and has been for eons. Susan Schneider, a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut, is one who has. She joins a handful of astronomers, including Seth Shostak, director of NASA’s Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, program, NASA Astrobiologist Paul Davies, and Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology Stephen Dick in espousing the view that the dominant intelligence in the cosmos is probably artificial. In her paper ""Alien Minds,"" written for a forthcoming NASA publication, Schneider describes why alien life forms are likely to be synthetic, and how such creatures might think. ""Most people have an iconic idea of aliens as these biological creatures, but that doesn’t make any sense from a timescale argument,"" Shostak told me. ""I’ve bet dozens of astronomers coffee that if we pick up an alien signal, it’ll be artificial life."" With the latest updates from NASA’s Kepler mission showing potentially habitable worlds strewn across the galaxy, it’s becoming harder and harder to assert that we’re alone in the universe. And if and when we do encounter intelligent life forms, we’ll want to communicate with them, which means we’ll need some basis for understanding their cognition. But for the vast majority of astrobiologists who study single-celled life, alien intelligence isn’t on the radar. ""If you asked me to bring together a panel of folks who have given the subject much thought, I would be hard pressed,"" said Shostak. ""Some think about communication strategies, of course. But few consider the nature of alien intelligence."" Schneider’s paper is among the first to tackle the subject. I’m not saying that we’re going to be running into IBM processors in outer space. In all likelihood, this intelligence will be way more sophisticated than anything humans can understand. ""Everything about their cognition—how their brains receive and process information, what their goals and incentives are—could be vastly different from our own,"" Schneider told me. ""Astrobiologists need to start thinking about the possibility of very different modes of cognition."" To wit, the case of artificial superintelligence. ""There’s an important distinction here from just ‘artificial intelligence’,"" Schneider told me. ""I’m not saying that we’re going to be running into IBM processors in outer space. In all likelihood, this intelligence will be way more sophisticated than anything humans can understand."" The reason for all this has to do, primarily, with timescales. For starters, when it comes to alien intelligence, there’s what Schneider calls the ""short window observation""—the notion that, by the time any society learns to transmit radio signals, they’re probably a hop-skip away from upgrading their own biology. It’s a twist on the belief popularized by Ray Kurzweil that humanity’s own post-biological future is near at hand. ""As soon as a civilization invents radio, they’re within fifty years of computers, then, probably, only another fifty to a hundred years from inventing AI,"" Shostak said. ""At that point, soft, squishy brains become an outdated model."" Schneider points to the nascent but rapidly expanding world of brain computer interface technology, including DARPA’s latest ElectRX neural implant program, as evidence that our own singularity is close. Eventually, Schneider predicts, we’ll not only upgrade our minds with technology, we’ll make a wholesale switch to synthetic hardware. Image: YouTube screenshot ""It could be that by the time we actually encounter other intelligences, most humans will have substantially enhanced their brains,"" Schneider said. Which speaks to Schneider’s second line of reasoning for superintelligent AI: Most of the radio-hot civilizations out there are probably thousands to millions of years older than us. That’s according to the astronomers who ruminate on such matters. ""The way you reach this conclusion is very straightforward,"" said Shostak. ""Consider the fact that any signal we pick up has to come from a civilization at least as advanced as we are. Now, let’s say, conservatively, the average civilization will use radio for 10,000 years. From a purely probabilistic point of view, the chance of encountering a society far older than ourselves is quite high."" It’s certainly humbling to consider that we may be galactic infants of beetle-like intelligence compared with our cosmic brethren. But despite their superior processing power, there’s a fundamental aspect of cognition our interstellar neighbors may lack: Consciousness. It sounds bizarre, but, Schneider writes, the jury’s still out on whether any artificial intelligence is capable of self-awareness. Simply put, we know so little about the neurological basis for consciousness; it’s almost impossible to predict what ingredients might go into replicating it artificially. ""I don’t see any good reason to believe an artificial superintelligence couldn’t possess consciousness, but it’s important to identify the possibility,"" said Schneider. Still, Schneider feels the assertion that artificial life simply can’t possess consciousness is losing ground. ""I believe the brain is inherently computational—we already have computational theories that describe aspects of consciousness, including working memory and attention,"" Schneider said. ""Given a computational brain, I don’t see any good argument that silicon, instead of carbon, can’t be a excellent medium for experience."" You don’t spend a whole lot of time hanging out reading books with your goldfish. On the other hand, you don’t really want to kill the goldfish, either."" I hope she’s right. Somehow, the notion of a galaxy teeming with soulless supercomputers is way creepier than introspective, WALL-E-like beings, or dry, sardonic Qs. ""It’s super creepy,"" Schneider agrees. Indeed, Schneider, who has written extensively on the subject of brain uploading, urges that humans should reflect deeply on this potential consequence of cognitive enhancement. The concept of superintelligent alien AI still sounds very speculative. And it is. But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth consideration. Indeed, expanding our purview of alien intelligence may help us identify life’s fingerprints in the cosmos. ""So far, we’ve pointed antennas at stars that might have planets that might have breathable atmospheres and oceans and so forth,"" Shostak told me. ""But if we’re correct that the dominant intelligence in the cosmos is artificial, then does it have to live on a planet with an ocean?"" It’s a bit of a mind-bender to think that habitable worlds may hold false promise when it comes to advanced alien life, but that seems to be Shostak’s conclusion. ""All artificial life forms would need is raw materials,"" he said. ""They might be in deep space, hovering around a star, or feeding off a black hole’s energy at the center of the galaxy."" (That last idea has seen its way into a number of science fiction novels, including works by Greg Bear and Gregory Benford). Which is to say, they could be, essentially, anywhere. Begging a final question: How might superintelligent aliens view us? Will our cosmic cousins see us as nothing more than convenient biofuel, a la the Matrix? Or do they study us quietly from afar, abiding by a Star Trek-esque maxim of non-interference? Schneider doubts either. In fact, she reckons superintelligent aliens couldn’t really care less about us. ""If they were interested in us, we probably wouldn’t be here,"" said Schneider. ""My gut feeling is their goals and incentives are so different from ours, they’re not going to want to contact us."" That’s a welcome divergence from Steven Hawking’s claim that advanced aliens might be nomads, looking to strip resources from whatever planets they can, and that all efforts to contact said aliens may end in our own demise. ""I’d have to agree with Susan on them not being interested in us at all,"" Shostak said. We're just too simplistic, too irrelevant. ""You don’t spend a whole lot of time hanging out reading books with your goldfish. On the other hand, you don’t really want to kill the goldfish, either."" So, if we want to meet our galactic peers, it looks like we’ll probably have to keep seeking them out. That may take thousands or millions of years, but in the meanwhile, perhaps we’ll upgrade our own intelligence enough to level the playing field. And as an early Christmas present, it seems we can all tick alien robots juicing us for energy off the list of likely apocalypses.","If and when we finally encounter aliens, they probably won’t look like little green men, or spiny insectoids. It’s likely they won’t be biological creatures at all, but rather, advanced robots that outstrip our intelligence in every conceivable way."

The problem: They're disturbingly bad for you — way more hazardous than the real thing. A new study from Tel Aviv University found that synthetic cannabis users — compared to users of regular cannabis — in psychiatric centers tended to be younger men, showed more severe psychotic symptoms, stayed hospitalized longer, had a previous record of being hospitalized and were more likely to be hospitalized by criminal court order. The study looked at patients of mental health centers between October 2007 and May 2014 who self-reported using synthetic cannabis or had a positive urine test for marijuana when they were admitted to the hospital. The study group was relatively small — 60 self-reported synthetic cannabis smokers, 163 non-synthetic users — but made a clear point: The man-made version of marijuana is a wrecking ball in your brain and could land you in psychiatric care.

875,"When I was in middle school, I straightened my hair every. Single. Day. I would sometimes even be late to school, because my ginger locks had to be pin-straight before I would leave the house. Now that I'm older and wiser (and lazier), I only use a flat iron once or twice a week. But when I heard about the heated brush that straightens your hair while you brush it, my life flashed before my eyes (I had so much spare time, my hair was beautifully straight and tangle-free, the world was my oyster!) and I had to try it. Head Kandy's Hair Straightening Brush is sleek, bright, and at $59.99, not terribly expensive as far as hot tools go. It has a little temperature control that can go up to 450 degrees and doesn't take too long to heat up, which is a bonus. After I gave my hair a quick comb with a regular brush (I wasn't sure if the heated brush could handle my day-old tangles), I grabbed the new tool to try. Before Since it was my first time using the brush, I was worried I'd burn myself, something that occurs way too often for someone whose been straightening and curling, for, like 10 years. But it has little rubber guards all around the heated metal bristles, so it's almost impossible (even for clumsy, clumsy me) to burn yourself. Plus, the little knobs make for one killer scalp massage. After a few minutes (I don't have that much hair), I was done. And my hair looked great! After, Angle 1 The brush worked exactly how the box claimed it would, except for the part I was most excited about: ""Cut straightening time in half."" It wasn't any quicker than using my flat iron. If anything, it took more time, because it gave me a more naturally straight look and I have to have super straight strands, otherwise my short bob looks like a mom 'do. So in the end, I ended up spending more time trying to get my hair to look the way I wanted. After, Angle 2 Honestly, I don't know why I thought it would be quicker. You use the exact same motion to run a brush through your hair as you do to straighten it. After, Angle 3 Timing aside though, the brush did exactly what it promised. So if you're into hot tools that massage your scalp and deflect burns like nobody's business, definitely give it a try.

887,"The latest wrinkle in the rapidly evolving casting saga that is ""50 Shades of Grey"" involves the details surrounding Charlie Hunnam's recent exit. Sources reportedly tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actor was embroiled in conflict with Universal Pictures over the film's script, leading to his decision to bow out of the project. Hunnam, a writer himself, reportedly submitted extensive notes about the script. Executives associated with the film received those notes positively, according to THR, and Hunnam eventually requested further script approval but was denied. That led to intensified conflict between the studio and Hunnam, who shortly thereafter threatened to drop the role of Christian Grey. The actor's team reportedly advised him to keep the gig so as not to damage relations with the studio, but his mind was apparently made up. In an effort to appease the star, Universal hired Patrick Marber (""Closer,"" ""Notes on a Scandal"") to do some rewrites on the script -- but the next day Hunnam announced his departure. (The official reason cited was Hunnam's production schedule on ""Sons of Anarchy,"" but ""50 Shades"" is slated to begin work after production on ""Anarchy"" ends.) THR notes that general media attention also contributed to Hunnam's decision to distance himself from ""50 Shades,"" which would have netted him a $125,000 paycheck. As previously reported, reactions to the casting decision were quite divisive. Universal hired a bodyguard for Hunnam at the recent ""Sons of Anarchy"" premiere.

888,"The Relict woolly mammoth (a.k.a. Mammuthus primigenius) is among the most revered pre-historic era species to become extinct. But a new study suggesting how they died off may surprise you. Around 10,000 years ago woolly mammoths were virtually wiped. They became extinct in North America and mainland Asia, but a smaller segment of the population remained–living the island life between Siberia and Alaska. In the recent Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists reveal that wooly mammoth populations survived on several small Beringian islands for thousands of years after mainland populations died off. According to the report, the last known populations of woolly mammoths were actually wiped out 5,600 years ago. Or to be specific– scientists were able to ""tightly constrain the timing of extinction to 5,600 ± 100 y ago."" How’s that for definitive? So the wooly islanders lived a lot longer than its mainland brethren. What finally did them in? In a word: water. Specifically– freshwater limitation. PNAS revealed that the wooly mammoth’s extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates. ""Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population, this evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change."" Rising sea levels eventually cut mammoths off from the mainland, limiting the number of water sources. It also reduced island size, plus led to lakes on the island becoming shallower. Also a contributing factor: degradation of water quality caused by intensified mammoth activity around the lake. This is similar to how elephants have been known to destroy vegetation, which can cause increased erosion and infilling of fresh water sources. PNAS solved the riddle of what killed off these island-dwelling mammoths via five independent indicators: Sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, diatom and cladoceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. According to the findings, vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, so neither is considered extinction drivers. The bottom line: humans had nothing to do with wooly mammoth extinction, and neither did lack of food. It was lack of water that most likely killed off the beloved pre-historic species. The question is—what can we do today to avoid the same kind of disaster from happening again? Even if humans are not present in places where rising sea levels threaten habitable places, there is plenty of proof that humans are contributing to and accelerating climate change, a common culprit of rising sea levels. In PNAS, findings about wooly mammoths’ extinction point to ""the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change."" It may be too late for the wooly mammoth, but humans still have a chance at survival. However, thanks to global warming, there is a growing list of human-habitated islands that could very well end up underwater eventually unless we turn the tide of rising sea levels. Unfortunately– without access to fresh water—islands getting swallowed up by water could be a moot point. To protect fresh water sources from rising sea levels—we should focus on what can be done to help stop global warming.

Later, Bryan found out that those crayons at dinner are thrown away, resulting in up to 75,000 pounds of waste annually. He knew there had to be a better use for these discarded crayons, and that gave him the idea to start The Crayon Initiative. Along with volunteers, Bryan collects unwanted crayons from restaurants and schools near his home in San Francisco. These crayons are sorted, then melted, and finally, are strained into molds Bryan developed himself. The molds make crayons that are larger than the originals, for good reason – these newly recycled crayons are headed for hospitals to be used by young and special needs children. Bryan and his volunteers are proud of the result. Children are known for their imaginations and creativity, which are hallmarks of growing up and learning. Using their imaginations is also a great way to get these kids to shift their focus away from their suffering. As you’ll see, the children in the hospitals who receive The Crayon Initiative’s gift need that shift in focus. Some are recovering from surgery, while others are battling cancer, the coloring brings welcome relief from those struggles.

900,"(Reuters Health) - High school girls who use the most effective methods of birth control are less likely to also use condoms, making them vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), researchers say. Girls who use intrauterine devices and implants to prevent pregnancies are less likely to use condoms than their peers taking birth control pills, they found. ""The findings highlight a need for strategies to increase condom use among all users of highly and moderately effective contraceptive methods ... to prevent STIs,"" wrote lead researcher Riley Steiner of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, in an email to Reuters Health. Intrauterine and implantable devices are highly effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, the researchers write in JAMA Pediatrics. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says these devices, which are known as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), should be first-line birth control options for teenagers. Among 100 women on LARC, there will be about one unintended pregnancy per year, according to ACOG. That's compared to six to nine unintended pregnancies among 100 women using the Depo-Provera shot, birth control pills, rings or patches. For the new study, the researchers used data from a 2013 survey of U.S. high school students in grades nine through 12. Of the 2,288 sexually active girls in the survey, about 2 percent used LARC, about 22 percent used birth control pills, about 41 percent used condoms, about 12 percent used withdrawal or other methods, about 16 percent used no contraceptive method and about 6 percent used the shot, patch or ring. About 2 percent didn't know which method they used. Overall, LARC users were about 60 percent less likely to use condoms, compared to girls taking birth control pills. There was no significant difference in condom use between those using the shot, patch or ring and those using LARC. Steiner said it's unclear why girls on LARC are less likely to use condoms but offered two possible explanations. ""Young women using highly effective LARC methods may be less likely to use condoms because they don’t perceive a need for additional protection from pregnancy; It’s also possible that providers are more likely to offer LARC to adolescents who rarely or never use condoms,"" she said. LARC users were also more likely to have two or more sexual partners in the past three months and four or more lifetime sexual partners, compared to those using the shot, patch, ring and pills. ""The important takeaway message from this story is that we need to be giving girls the right message of why condom use is important,"" said Dr. Julia Potter, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. Steiner said the new results should not deter adolescent LARC use, ""but rather inform how STI prevention is addressed within the context of adolescent LARC scale-up."" Potter, of Boston Medical Center, also said more research on why girls using LARC aren't using condoms as much is needed so that people aren't basing their opinions on assumptions.",girls on LARC are less likely to use condoms

Some of the biggest names in the US music industry, including Kanye West, Jennifer Hudson, Common and Lupe Fiasco were also raised in the city. Along with the funding crisis, Chicago also faces a reputation for being one of the most violent cities in the US. Chance met the governor of Illinois, Bruce Ratner, recently to talk about the amount of public funding that state run schools in Chicago get. He said the ""talks were unsuccessful"" and it prompted him to take action. ""The governor gave me a lot of vague answers in our meeting,"" Chance said at a press conference. As reported in the Chicago Tribune earlier this year, state run schools in the city have had to take urgent action to save money. It's because of a disagreement with Bruce Ratner, who vetoed a move to provide hundreds of millions of pounds worth of relief funds for Chicago's schools. He is willing to provide emergency money, but only if officials there change how the pensions system there works. All of the back and forth between officials and politicians got too much for Chance and so he decided to step in. He said without after-schools programmes: ""Over 380,000 kids will not have adult-supervised activities in June and could possibly be put in harm's way,"" Last year killings in the city hit a 20-year high and there were more than 500 murders reported. Most of those involved are young black men, many of whom were educated in Chicago's public schools. Chance is hoping that others will now put their hands in their pockets as well, he said: ""The check that I donated is a call to action. ""I'm challenging major companies and corporations Chicago and across the US to donate and take action.""","Chance the Rapper is giving $1m (£817,000) to schools in Chicago for ""arts and enrichment programming"""

913,"Extreme piety, witch burnings, frequent executions, countless legends of brave knights, clever folk heroes, fairytale-like villages, charming towns, bloody wars, stories of the rise and fall of many kings and queens, large fortresses that dot the landscapes, and of course, breathtaking castles. Yes, we are talking about the Middle Ages, a period of roughly 1,000 years full of events, historical figures, and exquisite pieces of architecture. It’s time to focus more on medieval architecture. Or, more precisely, to share with you the secrets of medieval castle designs. Primarily built for the purpose of protection, these magnificent structures defined an entire era and most certainly shaped the course of history. To say that medieval castles are very complex structures is clearly not enough, and that is why we need to have a look at the details of these defensive fortifications. The Moat One of the most important elements used in the defense of a medieval castle is without a doubt the moat, a wide, deep body of water that surrounds the castle. Apart from being an impressive sight to behold and a perfect obstacle to slow down the advance of enemy armies, the castle moat’s most important function was to prevent any attackers from digging tunnels. Castles without moats often faced the risk of being attacked from below. Invaders would dig a tunnel under the walls that could eventually help them penetrate the castle by causing the wall to collapse. A moat was the perfect defensive mechanism against tunnel digging, as it would likely collapse and the tunnel would be filled with water before the invaders could undermine the castle wall. Concentric Circles Developed in around the 13th century, this extraordinary method of defense offered the best protection against enemy attacks. The concentric multiple lines of defensive obstacles made the castle way more secure than any other defensive design of the past. As we all know, the word concentric means that one circle is inside another, and in the case of the medieval castle this meant that the attacking army had to primarily overcome the outer wall or earthworks, but even if the soldiers did, that didn’t mean that the battle was over. Their next obstacle would be the castle moat and then the inner wall, which would bring them to their last obstacle, the keep tower within the castle. The Main Gate Another exceptional defensive addition to the medieval castle was the main gate. One might think that the main gate was the most vulnerable part of the medieval castle, but the fact is that this structure was among the most heavily guarded spots, and additionally it was one of the most dangerous places as it was often filled with obstacles and deadly traps. With the help of an iron portcullis, the attackers could easily find themselves trapped in a small courtyard between the inner and outer gates. There was no way out–the unfortunate assailants could easily be attacked by archers positioned on top of the gatehouse, as well as having stones, boiling water, or hot oil dropped on them through the meurtrières (murder holes). The Stairwells If you have ever visited a medieval castle, you might have noticed that the stairwells are designed as a clockwise spiral. There is a very good reason why medieval castle designers chose to build them this way, and again it is all about defense. According to Will Kalif of All Things Medieval, ""this meant that any attackers coming up the stairs had their sword hands (right hand) against the interior curve of the wall and this made it very difficult for them to swing their swords."" On the other hand, the defenders could easily swing their swords and additionally, thanks to this specific design, their bodies were exposed much less than the bodies of their enemies. Secret Passages A practice known since ancient times, creating secret passages and secret chambers was nothing new during the medieval times, when secret passages were an integral part of the design of most castles. If besieged, the inhabitants of the castle could use these secret passages to get additional supplies or to escape safely if the attackers captured the castle. The inhabitants could use the secret chambers to hide or to store supplies and water.","""this meant that any attackers coming up the stairs had their sword hands (right hand) against the interior curve of the wall and this made it very difficult for them to swing their swords."" On the other hand, the defenders could easily swing their swords and additionally, thanks to this specific design, their bodies were exposed much less than the bodies of their enemies."
915,"The last time you stayed at a hotel, did you give any thought to the soap? It might not have occurred to you how much soap can go to waste every single day in a hotel or motel. Perhaps you unwrapped a bar and used it once, only to find it replaced later with a freshly wrapped bar. That's a lot of soap going down the drain. A couple of hotel maids in Florida realized the amount of soap going on the garbage heap at the end of every day was ridiculous. They decided to take advice from an old adage: waste not, want not. With that, they started an initiative to Clean the World. Clean the World is an organization that collects used bars of soap from hotels and recycles them into fresh new bars. The little soap leftovers from some 4,000 hotels world-wide are melted down, sanitized, formed into bars and repackaged. Now, instead of wasting away in a landfill, they are saving lives in third world nations. In many poor and struggling nations, people die every day of infections and illnesses that could have been prevented with basic sanitary conditions. The bars from Clean the World are shipped to these nations and distributed to people who need them most. To date, more than 25 million bars have been handed out. Next time you’re going on a trip, ask your hotel if they participate in Clean the World; if they don’t, tell them why they should.",recycles them into fresh new bars
918,"Credit card giant Mastercard is facing a record damages claim of up to £14billion for allegedly ripping-off millions of shoppers - and it could mean a windfall for millions of people in the UK. Lawyers have filed a case at the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the payments company. They believe up to 46 million Brits could be due money back because MasterCard charged shops too much for purchases between 1992 and 2008, a claim that the company denies. The original claim in July worked out at £450 each, but when lawyers filed the case the amount they were asking for had fallen - it now equates to roughly £330 per person. What's happening and who could be in line for a payout? We take a look: Who gets the cash if the case succeeds? You do (as long as you're over 18). Yes. Really. It doesn't matter whether you used a MasterCard, credit card, or anything else. The case is on behalf of everyone in Britain - not just MasterCard customers - who bought anything between 1992 and 2008. How you get the money hasn't been worked out yet - as this is the first case of its kind brought. What MasterCard did In a nutshell, MasterCard charges shops and businesses ""interchange fees"" when people buy products from them using its cards – they're the reason many places have ""minimum card spends"". Card providers use these fees to fund perks like cashback card deals, Air Miles and more to attract customers, among other things. But in 2014 the European Court of Justice declared that such fees were a violation of EU antitrust rules. On April 29 last year the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the Interchange Fee Regulation, and caps of 0.2% for debit cards and 0.3% for credit cards came into effect on December 9 . Previously MasterCard fees – as well as other card provider fees - were far higher than this, and that's what led to the lawsuit. The case against them The new lawsuit claims MasterCard set unlawfully high interchange fees for 16 years. These were then passed on to consumers in the form of inflated prices for good and services. Merricks argues the total damage caused to UK consumers could be as much as £14 billion, equating to hundreds of pounds for each shopper. ""My aim is to get the redress to which UK consumers are entitled and to ensure that MasterCard cannot hold on to the illegal profits it made,"" he said when the law suit was announced. If they're successful that would mean money back for everyone, regardless of whether they had a MasterCard or not. MasterCard's defence MasterCard firmly disagrees with this assessment of the situation. ""Now that the claim has been filed, we will take time to review it in detail, however we continue to firmly disagree with the basis of this claim and we intend to oppose it vigorously,"" MasterCard said. ""We deliver real value through the benefits of security, convenience and consumer protection, and we are committed to investing in our payment services in order to continue to meet the rapidly evolving needs of all our customers."" When the case was first announced, Tim Murphy and Mark Barnett from MasterCard explained in more details in a statement about the case on their site. ""Our cardholders benefit from some of the richest rewards programmes, seeing real added value beyond the purchase. ""And, technology like contactless payments and our work with transport networks are driving easier payments in everyday travel. ""Merchants also receive enormous benefits from our technology, including greater security and the most significant benefit of all – increased sales. ""Of course, there are costs to making a payment. In our system, the costs of making a payment are shared by all of those who benefit from the payment – the consumer, the card issuer, the retailer and the acquirer (what the industry calls the retailer’s or merchant’s bank) – all pay a small portion of the cost. ""By sharing the costs among ALL of those who benefit from the transaction, consumers and merchants obtain the full value of our technology at costs that are much lower than they could achieve if they paid the costs on their own. ""It is unfortunate to see the US class action system being replicated in the UK. All too often in class action cases, the only winners are the lawyers. If past experience is any indication, even the lawyers will be losers in this one."" Why now? US-based law firm Quinn Emanuel has been instructed to file the case under the new Consumer Rights Act 2015. That matters, as this piece of legislation means people can now pursue collective damages – class action lawsuits – in the UK. Boris Bronfentrinker, lead partner at Quinn Emanuel, said: ""This is precisely the type of claim for which the new collective action regime was established. This is a landmark case where unlawful anti-competitive conduct has harmed UK consumers. ""That harm, likely to be in the hundreds of pounds, is not large enough for any individual consumer to bring their own claim. But by aggregating the claims and bringing them on a collective basis, all UK consumers who lost out will get the compensation they are owed."" What next? ""The UK has never really seen class-action style suits like this, so we are very much in uncharted territory with this,"" Matt Rigby from customer complaint service Resolver.co.uk told Mirror Money. When filed, the case is expected to be heard by the Competition Appeal Tribunal. A spokesman said the case, which is unaffected by the UK’s decision to leave the EU, should be decided by 2018. Beyond Mastercard The good news is that this is just the first big class action suit brought in the UK under the new rules. MasterCard was far from alone in charging interchange fees to shops - which means if this proves successful then many more cases could follow. With a bit of luck, we could now start to see a string of companies called to account for charges, fees and more that people view as unfair - with benefits coming to everyone who's held them.",The case is on behalf of everyone in Britain - not just MasterCard customers - who bought anything between 1992 and 2008.
919,"When Melissa Banigan started suffering from a mystery illness, doctors simply told her to rest and eat better. Twenty years later she finally has a diagnosis Twenty years ago, I started experiencing what turned into a long list of seemingly unrelated health issues. Headaches, depression, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, joint pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, a lesion on my spine and a variety of uncomfortable gastrointestinal ailments. Over the past five years, things went from bad to worse as I also became lactose intolerant, developed mild vitiligo (a condition that leads to loss of skin pigmentation) and major vertigo, experienced a series of low-grade fevers and started to have some memory loss that I referred to as brain fogs. Doctors told me that as an overworked 40-year-old single mother, I might just need to figure out ways to get more sleep and relax. Some of what was happening, they said, might be attributed to the normal processes of ageing. What was happening, however, didn’t feel normal. Always a voracious reader and a writer by profession, I could no longer focus on work, read even a page of a book or grip a pen long enough to write a shopping list. I often felt too exhausted to keep plans with friends. When I did pull myself off my couch to see them, I couldn’t concentrate on conversations, so I stayed at home and let my friendships fade. I had been a runner, a swimmer and a hiker, but just walking up a flight of stairs made me lose my breath so completely that I succumbed to inactivity. I did everything the doctors asked me to do. I changed my diet and sleep schedule, went to a physical therapist and saw specialists in neurology and rheumatology and even a mental-health therapist. I then also turned to massage therapists, herbalists and an acupuncturist. Despite all of this, my symptoms worsened. The pins and needles sensations of the peripheral neuropathy in my arms and legs became so uncomfortable that it was difficult to sleep, and feelings of dread and severe joint pain roused me with a jolt most mornings at 3 or 4 o’clock. I tried to maintain a normal work schedule, but it was cut short when I went into an intensive care unit after a common cold turned into pneumonia and I developed sepsis. My brain fogs, which previously had amounted to forgetting a few words or leaving my keys in odd places, worsened. I forgot my Social Security number, important deadlines and, once, even the date of my daughter's birth. One afternoon, I stood in a room and had no idea where I was. Confused and panicked, my world feeling black, I finally realised that I was in the kitchen of my apartment in Brooklyn. The myriad of symptoms I had been dealing with for 20 years was no longer manageable. Feeling sound in neither mind nor body, I was terrified. The next day, I went to a neurologist (the third over the past many years), mostly concerned with my memory loss. Early-onset Alzheimer’s felt like the elephant in the room, but I was assured that I was too young. After giving me a short memory test – during which I couldn’t remember even the name of the mayor of New York – he scheduled a second appointment to conduct a longer cognition battery. As usual, one of his nurses drew blood during the first appointment. I thought nothing of it until I received a phone call the next morning: ""You have a B12 deficiency,"" I was told. A vitamin found naturally only in animal-sourced foods such as red meat and dairy products, B12 has a key role in the functioning of the brain and nervous system and is necessary for making healthy red blood cells. I had been taking the vitamin daily for more than a year as an oral supplement while I explored a vegan diet, so I was more than a little surprised to find out that I had a deficiency. ""It’s treatable,"" my doctor continued, easing some of my concern. The only catch? My deficiency might be caused by an autoimmune disease called pernicious anaemia. A chronic disease, pernicious anaemia occurs when the immune system attacks the parietal cells in the gastric glands and the lining of the stomach. These cells secrete a protein called intrinsic factor, which bonds with B12 before being absorbed through the gut. Without intrinsic factor, the body absorbs very little B12, which in my case had led to a deficiency despite the oral supplements I had been taking. Symptoms of the disease vary, but I had many of them, and it was worrisome to learn that without treatment, final stages can lead to congestive heart failure, degeneration of the spinal column, neurological complications such as dementia and – until a medical therapy was discovered in 1926 – a long, slow death. In the early 1920s, biological researcher and physician George Whipple found through experiments with dogs that raw liver offset the effects of anaemia. A few years later, George Richards Minot and William Parry Murphy discovered that their human patients’ anaemic symptoms were alleviated after eating half a pound of raw or lightly cooked calf liver every day. Whipple, Minot and Murphy received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 for their groundbreaking discoveries. Because pernicious anaemia appears most often in people of Scandinavian or northern European descent, it may be a hereditary disease. I already knew of my family’s strong Irish roots, and a simple DNA test revealed a genetic connection to long-forgotten Scandinavian ancestors. The final piece of my familial puzzle fit into place after I described my symptoms to relatives. ""When I was a child,"" my aunt told me, ""your Nana took what she called ‘liver shots.’"" B12 had been synthesised as cyanocobalamin in 1948, meaning that by the time my tiny Irish American grandmother was my age, she was able to forgo what I imagine were unsavoury daily doses of undercooked liver and instead take injections prescribed by a doctor for pernicious anaemia. My first ""liver shot"" eased my symptoms to such a degree that I felt like a new person: For the first time in my adult life, the pain I had been living with washed away, and my brain fog lifted overnight. I wonder whether my grandmother had a similar experience. Despite how easy it is to treat B12 deficiencies, millions of people remain affected. In poorer countries, this is because they lack the vitamin in their diets. In the United States, close to 40 per cent of people may have deficiencies, although only 0.1 per cent of the general population and 1.9 per cent of people older than 60 have pernicious anaemia. In the UK, pernicious anaemia effects around half a million people. It took about 20 years for me to receive the diagnosis that led to my first B12 injection. Research shows that the disease can take 20 years or more to progress, with symptoms worsening slowly over time. I am still lactose intolerant and have symptoms such as vitiligo and the pins and needles of peripheral neuropathy. The injections stave off the worst of my brain fogs, vertigo and other symptoms. My symptoms return slowly about two weeks after an injection and quickly by the third week. My insurance covers only one injection of B12 a month, however, which means my health and mental state fluctuate greatly depending on the week. If I had diabetes, my insurer probably wouldn’t restrict my access to insulin. My condition shouldn’t be treated differently. I hope that over time, as more people learn about pernicious anaemia, there will be fewer limits on treatment. The Wales-based Pernicious Anaemia Society was founded by Martyn Hooper in 2005 to raise awareness of the disease. When he was diagnosed in 2002, Hooper said, ""there was no ‘plain English’ explanation of the disease available. I resorted to looking up the word ‘pernicious’ in the dictionary and discovered it meant ‘ruinous, destructive and fatal.’ It was obvious that nothing was available to newly diagnosed patients."" The Pernicious Anaemia Society has more than 6,000 members, and I wish that there were such a group in the United States to raise awareness. I often feel frustrated with my insurer for not reimbursing me for all of the injections I need, and when I’m feeling my worst, I sometimes lament the loss of ruined romantic relationships or income from jobs I couldn’t complete because of my disease. I could have received a diagnosis much sooner. Yet a 20-year fog is lifting, and I’m hopeful that regular B12 injections will continue to make me feel better.","Despite how easy it is to treat B12 deficiencies, millions of people remain affected"
920,"A federal private prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, was secretly videotaping conversations between prisoners and their attorneys. Gianluca68/Thinkstock Last week the Department of Justice announced some seismic changes around the federal prison system. Obama’s DOJ ast week the Department of Justice announced some seismic changes around the federal prison system. Obama’s DOJ said it would stop contracting with private prisons, a decision that will reduce and eventually phase out the federal government’s reliance on these facilities. Dahlia Lithwick Slate, and hosts the podcast Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for, and hosts the podcast Amicus The move was based largely on an inspector general’s report that found that private prisons are more costly and lead to more violence than federal prisons. Among other problems, the IG report noted that disturbances in private prisons have led to ""extensive property damage, bodily injury, and the death of a Correctional Officer"" in recent years, making specific reference to a riot in a Mississippi facility in 2012 in which 20 people were injured and a guard was killed. Amid this news, it was easy to miss the story out of the Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas, in which a private prison system appears to have been committing a broad and systematic violation of the constitutional rights of its inmates. That federal private prison, operated by Corrections Corporation of America, was secretly videotaping conversations between prisoners and their lawyers and also allegedly recording audio of some phone calls between prisoners and their attorneys , then handing over some of the information from those recordings to state prosecutors. Corrections Corporation of America, which manages 85 facilities all over the country, appears to have basically been engaging in a widespread fishing expedition for evidence gleaned from secret videotapes—evidence they then handed off to prosecutors without the knowledge of prisoners nor their lawyers. A private attorney, Jacquelyn Rokusek, with a client implicated in that case was shown the taped conversations by federal prosecutors seeking to prove she had a conflict of interest. She then reported the tapes to the Federal Public Defender’s office, which represents about 75 clients at the Leavenworth facility. In July, the U.S. attorney’s office said that the surveillance footage they’d obtained showed some attorney-client meetings but that audio had never been recorded. The public defender’s office disputes that. But even if there were no audio, Rokusek noted in a motion to halt the recordings, ""documents we review with our clients, how our clients react to those documents, and the notes taken by client and counsel are open to government inspection and review."" This in and of itself would violate attorney-client privilege, she contends. Peter Joy, who teaches criminal law and legal ethics at Washington University in St. Louis, says that for constitutional purposes it wouldn’t matter that the video recordings may not in fact contain any sound. He noted that confidential communications between a client and her attorney are not limited to verbal discussions; they can include written statements and even those acted out in silence. ""Even if the tape showed only the back of the prisoner and the lawyer’s face, it can still be confidential,"" Joy told me. ""Confidential communications can include a client’s demeanor and just the fact that he appears very upset may violate confidentiality."" Anything that might chill the candor of attorney-client communications could be a serious violation of the Sixth Amendment. CCA takes the position that this kind of video recording is ""commonplace at detention facilities across the U.S."" The company told the Associated Press that the recordings didn’t contain audio and that the monitoring videos were taped for the safety of inmates, attorneys, and the facility. That wouldn’t explain why they were recorded, preserved, and shown to prosecutors. Additional evidence has since surfaced regarding taped phone calls at the prison (CCA said it does not record phone calls). Dan Margolies reported for the Kansas City, Missouri, NPR affiliate that the prison has allegedly been recording multiple calls between prisoners and their attorneys. At a hearing, defense attorneys alleged that taped phone recordings were also turned over to the U.S. attorney’s office and submitted a list of nine inmates whose calls they say had been recorded. ( The Intercept has done a series of damning investigative reports on widespread recording of telephone calls in prisons). On Aug. 10, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson entered an order directing prosecutors to turn over to the court all of the video they had obtained and to halt any video or audio recordings at prisons in her district, which includes the states of Kansas and Missouri. She also stated that she plans to appoint a special master to investigate the collection and distribution of the recordings. Late last week another federal judge, U.S. District Judge Stephen Bough, entered a similar order halting all facilities in the Western District of Missouri from recording any meetings, video conferences, or phone calls between attorneys and their clients, unless authorized in advance by a federal judicial officer. The Sixth Amendment protects the right to counsel and that right turns on the confidentiality of a client’s communications with his or her attorney. Anything that might chill the candor of such communications could be a serious violation of the Sixth Amendment. On its website, CCA announces that it protects the confidentiality of attorney-client visits—but that did not seem to be the case here. Professor Joy says that if what’s alleged has been happening, that would be a substantial constitutional violation. While CCA may take the position that everyone knows most facilities videotape all attorney-client meetings, the facts of the Leavenworth scandal suggest otherwise: ""Nobody knew,"" Joy said. ""The public defenders didn’t know; the judge didn’t know. Even some of the people in the U.S. attorney’s office didn’t know."" He added that even if only some of the conference rooms were taping attorney-client conversations, there were no signs posted anywhere suggesting that such monitoring was taking place at all. When push comes to shove, noted Joy, not every country is dedicated to the proposition that protecting attorney-client confidentiality truly matters. ""There are countries that have no respect for the accused’s privacy and confidentiality,"" he noted, ""countries where someone on behalf of the government can secretly film interactions between clients and their lawyers and then secretly turn it over to the government.

921,"Has spam promising a larger male member with a pill or a cream ever tempted you to click? Hold off, guys. New research confirms that anxiety about penis size doesn't correlate to what's really in your pants. In fact, plenty of well-endowed men are ashamed of their penises, while lots of men with smaller penises strut their stuff with confidence, according to a study published online Sept. 30 in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. The findings are no surprise, said study leader David Veale, a psychiatrist at King's College London. ""It's an emotional feeling,"" Veale said of penis shame. Like other forms of body dissatisfaction, penis-size anxiety is rarely linked to reality, he told LiveScience. Measuring up Men worry far more than women about penis size, according to Veale and his colleagues. One study, published in April in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that women preferred larger penises only up to a point (anything bigger than a flaccid length of 2.99 inches (7.59 centimeters) did not additionally impress women), and preferences also varied based on a guy's height. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found similarly ambivalent female preferences. In that study, women who experienced frequent vaginal orgasms were much more likely than other women to express an interest in better-endowed guys. For women who didn't prefer vaginal orgasms, penis size was a far less pressing matter. Nevertheless, men continue to fret over the size of their penises, listing it among their top body concerns along with height and weight, according to a 2008 study in the Journal of Health Psychology. Veale and his colleagues wanted to quantify that anxiety — an important step toward being able to evaluate psychological treatments designed to boost guys' self-image. To do so, the researchers recruited 173 men online and at King's College London, and asked them to complete a battery of questionnaires on body image, erectile function and concerns about their penises. In addition, 46 of the men agreed to have their penises measured by a urologist in both flaccid and erect states. Feeling shame By comparing the men's answers to the questionnaires to their stated concerns about their genitalia, Veale and his colleagues were able to narrow down their scale to 10 questions that were sure to reveal a guy's inner fears about his penis. The questions, available for download on the King's College London website, measure a man's fear of being alone or rejected because of his penis size, his terror that others will laugh at him, and his anxieties about being naked around women and other men. The most surprising response, Veale said, was men agreeing with the following statement: ""Others will be able to see the size or shape of my penis even when I have my trousers on."" ""That must be extreme self-consciousness,"" he said. Among the men tested, 30 percent reported dissatisfaction with their genitals. About 35 percent of the men were very happy with their penis size, with the rest falling somewhere in between satisfied and dissatisfied. Older guys and gay or bisexual men were more likely to show high penis anxiety, the researchers reported. Gay or bisexual men typically have more body-image problems than straight men do, the researchers wrote, and also have more opportunities to compare body parts. The penises measured in the study ranged from 2.75 inches to 7 inches (7 to 18 centimeters) long in a flaccid-but-stretched state, and from 3.93 inches to 7.87 inches (10 to 20 cm) when erect. Girth ranged from 2.75 inches to 5.11 inches (7 to 13 cm) when flaccid and from 3.54 inches to 6.69 inches (9 to 17 cm) when erect. (A recent Journal of Sexual Medicine study found that the average American man's penis measures 5.6 inches, or 14.2 cm, long when erect.) The bottom line to all these numbers, however, is that they meant not a whit for men's perceptions of their penis size. Big or small didn't matter as much as the fears men carried in their heads.

923,"When it comes to your facial hair, you probably ride on either extreme: You cater your scruff to what a girl wants; or, you don't care what women think and grow whatever the hell you want. Well, if you're single, the state of your facial hair can attract flings or long-term relationships, depending on how you style it, according to new research from Wiley. In the study, published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, researchers had 8,520 women rate the physical attractiveness of men with varying degrees of facial hair, all of which were manipulated using computer graphics. The researchers also played with traditionally male-typical features, like a more pronounced brow and jawline (which, the team says, can signify underlying health—thanks to evolution; beards on the other hand can signal a man's age, even social status, and dominance. Bottom line: Beardedness (or lack there of) had a major influence on a guy's sex appeal and perceived masculinity. When women viewed clean-shaven men, those that were masculinized and, even more so, feminized were viewed as less attractive than men whose faces were unmanipulated. In other words, it was unanimous across the board, whether women were looking for one-night stands or potential husbands. Stubble was deemed most attractive overall and received higher ratings for flings and short-term relationships than full beards. Full beards were attractive to women searching for long-term relationships. The researchers believe beards make men seem more ""formidable""—in a red-blooded, strong, and strapping kind of way—that gives women the sense they can provide direct benefits, like enhanced fertility and survival.

930,"The running joke among Indian entrepreneurs is that it's easier to get a divorce than to shut down a company. And the experience of Stayzilla co-founders Yogendra Vasupal and Sachit Singhi shows that it can get extremely messy. Closing a company in India can take years, though opening one — or many — is easy enough. When Thirukumaran Nagarajan decided to close his edtech startup Eduraft in 2013, a year after setting it up, he simply ceased operations, returned investor money, and moved on. Two years later, the auditors at his current venture NinjaCart —his third attempt, and an agri-marketing platform that's managed to raise funding — advised him to formally close Eduraft. It's been four years since he decided to take them up on that advice but he's still trying to wind up the business. ""Since we didn't have any creditors and had returned our investor money, we thought we were good to go. Later, we found out that it is not as simple as that. Regulatory compliance requires a procedure to be followed while returning money. Not shutting an earlier venture can create roadblocks for the current venture. We are now getting ready to file the winding-up petition,"" says Nagarajan. While being an entrepreneur seems exciting and fail-fast is the new refrain, India's archaic laws and labyrinthine processes of liquidation make dealing with shutting down a startup far harder than handling the emotional struggle of giving up. And dealing with external stakeholders such as vendors and landlords — as in the case of Stayzilla — can complicate matters further. ""Closing a company under a liquidation process can take years. Abandoning a business is not the solution. Defaults in company law compliance and inherent shareholder obligations will lead to a black mark in the RoC's (Registrar of Companies') records,"" said Harshal Kamdar, partner, PwC. Kamdar says there are quicker ways of winding up. If an asset sale is undertaken, one can kill business in a week or two. If one can demonstrate that the company has no assets and operations for two years, the process can be faster. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which is being finalised, is expected to ease some of the pain involved in the liquidation process. ""The current regulations are drafted with a large company mindset. So whether it is a big corporate, for example Kingfisher Airlines, or a small startup, the procedure is broadly the same,"" said Kamdar. For consumer businesses, the process is particularly tedious. ""The legal processes make it impractical for a retail business to shut shop. For example, the company is expected to obtain a no-objection certificate from all its vendors. That's a hard thing to get,"" said K Vaitheeswaran, entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer. Vaitheeswaran's Fabmall.com, which later became IndiaPlaza, was one of the earliest e-commerce companies set up in 1999. Vaitheeswaran knows firsthand — the difficulties and pain of dealing with employees, vendors and irate customers when a startup is in its death throes, after having had to watch suppliers and the landlord pick up and walk away with every movable asset in his Bengaluru office in 2013. ""Dealing with individuals is difficult. Large creditors follow due process and understand when a business folds. Smaller creditors don't take it well because a few lakhs is a huge dent for them. Any consumer-facing business is difficult to wrap up, especially if there are orders to be honoured or dues to be paid,"" he said. Natraj M, a vendor on IndiaPlaza, is clear that he will not engage with any e-commerce player after having burned his fingers not once, but twice. ""I had a personal relationship with Vaitheeswaran. When he gave me the news, it came as a shock, but there wasn't much I could do. I knew he had taken a hit and I had to commiserate,"" he said. ""But I'm not selling online again. It's too risky."" Employees are among the first to bear the brunt of a slowdown in operations at a startup. While many are able to read the signs of a sinking ship — delayed salaries, payouts in instalments, cutting of perks and privileges — and bail out, those left behind can lose their cool. In November 2015, sacked employees of food delivery startup TinyOwl kept co-founder Gaurav Chaudhary hostage for over two days. They released him on the promise of notice period salary payment. Bengaluru-based logistics startup Townrush's office was vandalised by its delivery boys after non-payment of salaries for months. Experts say the big flaw in the government's Startup India plan is its failure to account for shutting down. ""We all know the high failure rate of startups. Three years down the line, there will be thousands of companies shutting down. We are staring at a huge social problem,"" said Vaitheeswaran.",it's easier to get a divorce than to shut down a company

934,"You can look at the financial health of Social Security in many ways. The official version, found in the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees' annual report, is this:  Social Security's total income is projected to exceed its total cost through 2019, as it has since 1982. After 2019, interest income and money taken out of reserves will provide the resources needed to offset Social Security's annual deficits until 2034. By then, if Congress does nothing, the federal government will collect enough in payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of scheduled retirement benefits until 2090. The Social Security Administration projects that unfunded obligations will reach $11.4 trillion by 2090. That's up $700 billion from the $10.7 trillion the administration projected for its 2089 shortfall. Infinite horizon Despite the huge numbers, there's even a less generous way of looking at the fiscal shortfall. A projection, known as the ""infinite horizon,"" takes into account all the program's future liabilities, even those beyond the 75-year period that Social Security actuaries typically use in their calculations. Under the infinite horizon, Social Security will have $32.1 trillion in unfunded liabilities by 2090, $6.3 trillion more than last year's projection. (See the chart below.) The infinite horizon calculation is the most important part of the trustees' annual report, said Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor and co-author of ""Get What's Yours,"" a best-seller about how to maximize claiming Social Security retirement benefits. ""We're not broke in 20 years to 30 years, we're broke now,"" Kotlikoff said. ""All the bills have been kept off the books by Congress and presidential administrations for six decades."" The $6.3 trillion increase in the infinite horizon projection shows that Social Security Administration actuaries are more pessimistic about economic and wage growth, Kotlikoff said. A reduction in the interest rate used to make calculations under the infinite horizon projection from 2.9 percent to 2.7 percent was the main contributor to the rise in the unfunded obligations forecast from last year, according to the trustees' report. ""You can't hide the numbers under a bunch of malarkey,"" said Kotlikoff, who is running for president as a write-in candidate. Kotlikoff had an influential ally in his quest for better accounting for Social Security and other federal programs. In 2013, Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee, co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would require the federal government to use infinite horizon calculations and so-called fiscal gap accounting, which considers the difference between the government's projected financial obligations and the present value of all projected future tax and other revenue. The bill, which Kotlikoff championed, did not pass. Presidential proposals Presidential candidates from the two major political parties have yet to present detailed plans for how they will address Social Security's shortfall.  Hillary Clinton said she won't cut Social Security benefits and will expand the program, especially for widows and people who have left the workforce to take care of children, spouses or relatives. She plans to ask ""the highest-income Americans to pay more, including options to tax some of their income above the current Social Security cap and taxing some of their income not currently taken into account by the Social Security system,"" according to her campaign website. Currently, earnings up to $118,500 are taxed for Social Security benefits. Eliminating the cap this year would mean the trust fund reserves would be depleted in 2055 instead of 2034, according to estimates from Karen Smith, a senior fellow in the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. Clinton opposes ""any attempts to gamble seniors' retirement security on the stock market through privatization."" However, investing a portion of Social Security's trust fund assets in stocks would likely reduce the need for higher payroll taxes without disrupting the capital markets, according to a recent analysis by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Donald Trump has said he wants to preserve Social Security, saying the key to do so is to have ""an economy that is robust and growing.""  Stronger economic growth may delay Social Security's insolvency, but it would not fix its underlying fiscal problems, according to Smith's research. So what would have a big impact on Social Security's fiscal standing if you don't cut benefits? Raising payroll taxes. Smith found that increasing payroll taxes by 3 percentage points from 12.4 percent — half paid by employers and half paid by employees — to 15.4 percent would make Social Security reserves last at least 53 years longer, or until 2087. Few politicians are proposing that fix for future generations.","Under the infinite horizon, Social Security will have $32.1 trillion in unfunded liabilities by 2090"
938,"I held the spoon to my mouth, and I grimaced when the contents touched my tongue — warm, mushy carrots. This was my 7-month-old son's dinner — and mine too. I would spend a week eating baby food, although it was less of a calculated effort and more of a desperate attempt to hang onto my sanity. As a new mother who worked from home, I was unprepared for how difficult it would be to juggle both a job and an infant, often getting crapped on from everyone, everywhere. The laundry piled up to unbelievable heights. The dishes in the sink smelled like a homeland security threat. For myself, I did the bare minimum to erase the stink lines that followed me around like Pigpen in a Peanuts comic. Something had to give, I realized. And that something was chewing. I'm kidding. Chewing wasn't so much the issue. The problem was the time it took to make myself a separate meal. When the choice came down to cooking for my son and cooking for myself, it was an easy decision. He who sobs the loudest wins. This sort of thing wasn't new for me, per se. I've done some crazy diets in the past. In college, I was the originator of the Beef Jerky Diet, which sprained my jaw before I ever lost any weight. (No wonder my diet never caught on.) I've been a raw foodist and I've tried juices. I've scrubbed my guts with gallons of cabbage soup and master cleansed with liters of lemonade. One time I ate nothing but raw macadamia nuts for three days. Most Popular When my son began eating solid foods, I decided to make all his meals from scratch. I'm a person who enjoys cooking anyway, and it was important to me to provide him with fresh, healthy produce. When I thought about it, eating baby food wasn't a bad idea idea. After all, many of the world's most beloved foods are enjoyed in their squished form. Guacamole is perfection. Applesauce is awesome. Hummus is great. And who doesn't love mashed potatoes? Plus, I've been enough to fancy restaurants where entrees are served atop puddles of parsnip mash or dollops of spring pea purée. This wasn't mere baby food I was creating — it was cutting-edge cuisine! At first, the purées I ate were terrific, like downing super thick smoothies for every meal. And it really did save a lot of time, which otherwise would have been spent over the stove or cleaning the dishes. The bonus was that it forced me to be more creative with the things I whipped up in the blender, because I wanted to consume delicious things too. Snap peas, pears and a banana? Tasty. Sweet potatoes, cherries and vanilla? Like a party in my mouth. Fava beans and summer squash with leeks? Eh, not the worst. After a week of baby food; however, eating became something laborious. It was no longer interesting or enjoyable. I fantasized about crunch. Chewing felt like an old friend I only vaguely remembered. I realized I was on the diet of someone who just had his wisdom teeth pulled, but for no real reason. That's the day I decided to reverse the process: Instead of eating what my baby eats, I would simply give him what I like to eat. It's a strategy that has worked well for us ever since, with a food repertoire that has expanded to include soft grilled eggplant, five-bean chili, rice pudding, roasted veggies of all kinds, aloo gobi and pillows of naan. We didn't want to be those culinary snobs who go to a restaurant and just order the parsnip purée, anyway.",eating became something laborious. It was no longer interesting or enjoyable.
939,"Trump Is Paying Himself With Campaign Cash. Is That Legal? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to supporters at his primary election night event at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., Tuesday, March 15, 2016. CREDIT: AP PHOTO/GERALD HERBERT There’s a lot to unpack in Donald Trump’s latest campaign finance disclosure. For one, his campaign doesn’t have a lot of cash. For another, some of his individual expenses are pretty sketchy. But perhaps the most fascinating thing about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s financial report is how much money his campaign is spending on himself. In the month of May, Trump spent more than $1 million in campaign cash on his own businesses. Put another way, nearly 20 percent of Trump’s campaign spending last month went to benefit Trump-owned companies. Since Trump’s financial disclosure form was released on Monday, a good number of journalists have pointed out Trump’s propensity to spend campaign funds on his own companies. But what’s been less explored are the ethics behind this practice. Is it right for Trump to use his campaign’s money on his own businesses? Is it normal? Is it legal? It’s certainly not normal, according to Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government ethics watchdog group. It’s highly unusual to have a campaign paying a candidate’s businesses on anything like this scale. ""It’s highly unusual to have a campaign paying a candidate’s businesses on anything like this scale,"" he told ThinkProgress on Tuesday. ""It’s not that unusual to have some office space rented from the candidates’ business, but to have so many different businesses for so much of the campaign’s work, with the money essentially going to the candidate, that’s extremely unusual."" Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, agreed that Trump’s persistent practice of paying himself was not normal for a presidential candidate. As for whether it’s legal, Painter told ThinkProgress that it might be — but Trump has to walk a fine line when it comes to how much he’s charging himself. ""If I were advising somebody in his situation, who had a campaign that owned a lot of hotels and other facilities, I’d say that you could use those facilities if you had an arms length transaction — if you were renting the facility for market value,"" Painter said. In other words, Painter said, if Trump wants to avoid breaking the law or being unethical, he must charge himself exactly the same amount of money as he would charge any other customer for use of his facilities. For example, if a Trump-owned hotel room goes for $400 per night, Trump must charge his campaign $400 per night if he wants to use that facility. There are a few reasons for this. Most of Trump’s businesses are corporations, which by law cannot make direct contributions to political campaigns. So, if Trump charged himself too little — say, if he only charged himself $300 per night for a $400 room — that would amount to a $100 contribution from his own corporation. That contribution would be illegal. Conversely, Bookbinder said, it would be unethical and possibly illegal if a Trump corporation charged the Trump campaign too much, because Trump would be essentially making money off of donations from other people. If [Trump’s businesses] are being overpaid, that could be an illegal personal use of campaign funds. ""If [Trump’s businesses] are being overpaid, that could be an illegal personal use of campaign funds,"" Bookbinder said. ""Basically, the candidate would be financially benefiting from his campaign improperly."" The problem, both Bookbinder and Painter said, is that it’s very hard to figure out how much exactly Trump is charging his campaign for use of his own facilities, and whether those charges line up with market value. The campaign only provides a lump sum for how much it paid each of Trump’s businesses — it doesn’t provide detailed individual expenditures. Based on an initial look at the disclosure form, Painter said he doesn’t believe Trump is currently at a Jesse Jackson Jr.-type level of campaign fund misuse. What Painter does believe, however, is that Trump’s disclosure indicates that the candidate won’t part ways with his lucrative business holdings should he become president. ""What this does illustrate is that [Trump’s] very closely tied with his real estate holdings — he does not plan to get rid of them,"" Painter said. ""And that means all his conflicts of interests are not going to go away if he’s president."" Indeed, Trump’s financial conflicts of interest would engorge if he was elected to the White House. The big difference is that, if Trump is elected president, conflict of interest laws that currently apply to him as a candidate will no longer be in effect. In the end, Bookbinder said, it will all come down to whether Trump honestly wants to use his campaign and the presidency for the public interest, and not his own personal financial gain. ""Are campaign decisions being made for the financial interest of the candidate, rather than for the best interest of the campaign, or in any sense the public interest? Is this campaign essentially partly a way to enrich Mr. Trump and his businesses? It’s very hard to know,"" Bookbinder said. ""And that raises some potentially troubling questions.""",it might be — but Trump has to walk a fine line when it comes to how much he’s charging himself.

951,"Biometrics might be cool and convenient, but the technology could potentially undermine your legal rights under the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the government from compelling a witness to testify against herself. A court or police officer could legally compel you to press your finger onto your smartphone to unlock it, but if your phone was locked with a passcode, no one could legally compel you to open your phone, says William J. Cook , an attorney and partner at law firm Reed Smith in Chicago, who specializes in information technology, privacy and data security. Cook explains that the difference between a password and a biometric identifier is great under the law--you have a right not to reveal the contents of your mind, which includes things like a password, but your fingerprints are a part of who you are and you expose them to the public everyday. This is why when a person gets arrested, they have to submit their fingerprints but have a right to remain silent. Thoughts are protected, biometric identifiers (fingerprints, face or hair) are not. Ever since Apple introduced Touch ID in 2013, privacy law experts have been sounding the alarm about the way biometrics can whittle away at your right against self-incrimination. ""The Fifth Amendment protects individuals against saying anything, testimony or statements, that could incriminate themselves,"" says Paul Bond , who is also a partner at Reed Smith. ""While it protects information, it does not shield physical things in the world available for production. Making the key to your information a physical key or biometric identifier is putting it in the realm of police power to produce."" The unlocking of smartphones and computers has become a legal niche, but this niche will soon grow to become a big part of many cases, Cook says. The FBI uses search warrants based on probable cause (the Fourth Amendment) to compel companies like Apple to unlock the phones belonging to alleged criminals to find evidence of crimes, but authorities are also gaining access to devices that use biometric identification systems, like Apple's Touch ID, by obtaining search warrants to force people to press a finger on to a mobile phone, Cook says. Recently in Los Angeles, a federal judge signed a warrant to allow the FBI to force a 29-year-old woman to press her finger on to an iPhone cops had seized from her boyfriend's home, an alleged gang member, the Los Angeles Times reported last week. This marked the first time a suspect had been forced to unlock an iPhone via Touch ID in a federal case. More criminal investigations will involve accessing personal devices like smartphones and biometric authentication technology is spreading to more devices. As even more employees download work-related information and data on their personal phones, these three factors are conspiring to make company data a potential casualty of biometric technology's legal protection problem, Bond says. ""If all it takes is a fingerprint swipe by an employee, at that point the control of the information is out of the hands of the company,"" Bond says.","Cook explains that the difference between a password and a biometric identifier is great under the law--you have a right not to reveal the contents of your mind, which includes things like a password, but your fingerprints are a part of who you are and you expose them to the public everyday."

Everyone’s already pointed out how silly this looks — but is it really a bad idea? There’s no question people look silly when they do this, but people look silly when they do many common things. Many people still think Bluetooth earpieces look ridiculous, but they’re still used by many people each day. Phone vs. Tablet Camera Hardware Most tablets have rear cameras, just like you’ll find on smartphones. People aren’t just taking selfies with these things. But how good are these cameras? Let’s compare Apple’s latest iPad Air and iPhone 5s to each other. The rear-facing ""iSight Camera"" captures 5 megapixel photos on the iPad Air, while it captures 8 MP photos on the iPhone 5s. The rear-facing camera on the iPhone 5s also offers additional features designed for capturing better photos. It’s clear that Apple’s top-of-the-line iPhone has a superior rear-facing camera to their top-of-the-line iPad. This isn’t all about Apple devices. The same will be true of most other devices, including Android tablets and smartphones. For example, Samsung’s Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 tablet has an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera, while their Galaxy S4 smartphone has a 13 MP camera. Megapixels aren’t the only thing that matters when it comes to comparing cameras. A camera with fewer megapixels could be better than another camera with more megapixels for other reasons. We’re using it as a shortcut here — if Apple or Samsung make their own cameras and use similar ones, it’s likely that the higher megapixel cameras will be more expensive and higher quality. Unless you have a very cheap or old phone and a top-of-the-line, recent tablet, your smartphone includes better camera hardware than your tablet. If you have both a smartphone and tablet nearby, you should pick up your smartphone to take a picture — you’ll get higher-quality photos. Manufacturers know most people will use a smartphone camera more than a tablet camera, so they put more expensive, higher-quality cameras in their phones. Why Take a Photo With a Tablet? Tablets have basically the same photo-taking software you’ll find on a smartphone. This is especially true on Android tablets and Apple’s iPad, but even Windows 8 desktop PCs now include a smartphone-style photo-taking app. For example, on Microsoft’s Surface Pro PC , you can swipe down on the lock screen and bring up a camera that lets you use the tablet’s rear camera, effectively turning your $1000 PC into a bulky handheld camera. Some people may prefer a smartphone a tablet to a smartphone when taking pictures. For example, a tablet provides a larger screen for previewing the resulting photograph. If a person has poor eyesight, this can help when taking photos — it’s easier than squinting at a tiny screen. For some people who need the larger previews, a tablet may be the ideal digital camera. On a tablet, you can also easily begin editing and working with the photos immediately after you take them. Rather than using a smartphone photo-editing app, you can use more full-featured tablet apps. On a full Windows 8 tablet, you could even open those photos in the desktop version of Photoshop without transferring them to another device. Of course, you could also set up something like Dropbox to automatically upload the photos you take from your iPhone or Android phone Tablets Distract and Get In the Way Aside from looking silly, taking photos with a tablet is distracting and can block other people from seeing what you’re photographing or taking their own photos. Just picture someone standing in front of you at a tourist attraction, holding up their iPad to take a photo and blocking the view. A phone is especially ideal for these situations, as it’s smaller. It won’t draw as much attention, take up as much space, or block as many views. ""The Best Camera Is the One You Have With You"" Of course, the best camera is the one you have with you at any given time. If you’re using a tablet and you need to take a photo as quickly as possible, the tablet in your hands may be the ideal camera. If all you have is a tablet with you or you have a nice tablet and an old smartphone, a tablet may be superior to your smartphone. Most people shouldn’t be taking photos with tablets — if only because tablets offer worse photo quality than comparable smartphones. Your smartphone is a better camera, so whip it out instead. In crowds, people nearby will appreciate that you’re not blocking their views with your larger screen. But maybe we shouldn’t laugh at people we see using tablets as cameras. The next person you see snapping a picture with a tablet may have poor eyesight and may be benefiting from the larger preview area. Taking a photo with a tablet isn’t always the worst idea in the world. Whatever we think of it, people will be taking photos with tablets for years to come. There’s a reason tablets come with rear-facing cameras in the first place, and it’s a bit silly to complain when people make use of them. We can only hope that people use them responsibly and don’t get in everyone’s way when snapping those iPad photos.","There’s a reason tablets come with rear-facing cameras in the first place, and it’s a bit silly to complain when people make use of them."
961,"On Saturday morning, fans of The Voice were shocked to wake up and hear that singer Christina Grimmie had been shot and killed outside the Plaza Live theater in Orlando, Florida. And, on Sunday morning, the country was shocked to wake up and hear that a shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando led to the deaths of at least 50 people. Considering the two incidents were just 24 hours apart in the same location, many found themselves wondering whether the Pulse shooting was related to Grimmie's shooting. (Update: The FBI has updated the death toll to 49 victims. The shooter was also killed.) But, it seems the location is the only thing both tragedies have in common, the worst example of a coincidence. According to ABC News, officials in Orlando have confirmed that both were isolated cases. Though a motive for Grimmie's death has yet to be determined, the lone gunman appeared not to know the singer personally, and also took his own life after shooting Grimmie when the Voice contestant was signing autographs for fans following a show. When it comes to the shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub, even less is known regarding the gunman and the motive, beyond its lack of a link to Grimmie's shooting. That said, police, who have named the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, are calling the Pulse shooting an act of terrorism, and the perpetrator a ""lone wolf."" The suspect was confirmed killed by authorities as well. ORLANDO, FL - JUNE 12: Orlando police officers seen outside of Pulse nightclub after a fatal shooting and hostage situation on June 12, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. The suspect was shot and killed by police after 20 people died and 42 were injured. (Photo by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images) Early Sunday morning, a gunman entered the Pulse nightclub, taking many club goers hostage in a three-hour span. A total of 30 people were rescued during the hostage situation at the club — which held about 320 individuals at the time of the shooting, according to authorities — and over 50 people are currently being treated at hospitals. Said Orlando Mayer Buddy Dyer Sunday, ""Tonight our community witnessed or experienced a very horrific crime ... Many lives were lost, and many more individuals were impacted by witnessing the crime."" After a frightening 48 hours in Orlando, residents can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that, according to authorities, there is no threat of more attacks in Florida following both incidents. But, considering there have been over 150 mass shootings in 2016 alone in the U.S., sadly, it seems relief might be short-lived.",the location is the only thing both tragedies have in common

970,"Small celebrity roles and cameos can deliver a major blow to a film's budget, even when the star is only on screen for a matter of seconds. In the DVD commentary for Deadpool, lead actor and producer Ryan Reynolds reveals that it cost the project about $10,000 (which dwarfs what some crew members make on big budget films) to have his character wear a tank top illustrated with actress Bea Arthur's face, Empire Magazine recently reported. In the comic books, Deadpool is Arthur's self-proclaimed ""number one fan"" and likes to watch episodes of The Golden Girls. The writers even named the spaceship for the Deadpool Corps ""The Bea Arthur"" in her honor. So, it seemed natural for the actress to play a role in the film—at any cost. In the commentary track, Reynolds said that showing the tank top in the film was ""potentially cinema's most expensive Easter Egg ever,"" adding that ""as a producer, I had to approve that $10,000 ...

973,"Bad news for The Division cheaters as Ubisoft finally announce harsh punishment for offenders The team that made The Division have had enough and decided that it’s one strike and you’re out. From an announcement made on the official Division website , the team stated that even first time offenders would be perma-banned if caught cheating in the game. The announcement starts by acknowledging the effect cheating has had on the gamer base: ""Cheating has been a source of frustration for our community as some individuals have been gaining an unfair advantage in the game by using third-party software at the expense of our loyal players"" The rest of the announcement delves a little further into how exactly this cheating has been occurring, information coming from a podcast they released earlier on the matter. They state: ""While some of the game decisions are made client-side, there are constant server checks in place. This ensures that even in the situation where a player would be able to modify his client data, the servers can detect it."" It’s from the client-server disparities that allow the cheaters to cheat. As good as the server checks are, things can still slip past. When The Division was initially released, lots of things could circumvent the server checks and gamers were free to abuse these as they saw fit. Now though, the checks are much more in-depth and secure, and it’s becoming harder and harder for players to cheat in the game without getting noticed. With this new, iron-fist approach to even first time offenders, cheating could very soon become a thing of the past entirely. This is all well and good. However, due to the extreme amount of negative responses The Division has accumulated since release, there may not be much of a player base to cheat soon anyways. The game is haemorrhaging players on PC, according to data provided by Steam itself. The peak number of gamers playing at one time in June so far is a little over 16,000. Compare that back closer to when the game launched in March, and a peak of 114,000 players can be seen. That is a phenomenal loss of players in that space of time. Three months and 100,000 players lave the game? Ouch. If that kind of trend continues, no one will be playing The Division at all come the end of the year. So, it’s a good thing that The Division is becoming more regulated and less cheatable, but it might be too little too late to save it from its possibly inevitable doom. It’s very possible that the game might see a resurgence in popularity, but usually once a game has lost steam, there’s little else you can do but stoke the fire and pray for the best. Time will tell what lies in store for the future of The Division, and what kind of legacy its tumultuous release will leave on the industry.",even first time offenders would be perma-banned if caught cheating
974,"This Year's Perseid Meteor Shower Is Going To Be Quite A Show — Here's How To Watch Enlarge this image toggle caption Amel Emric/AP Amel Emric/AP Night owls and stargazers, get ready for something spectacular on Thursday. The annual Perseid meteor shower, already one of the most reliably impressive celestial events, promises to be especially good this year. The Perseid shower happens every year in August ""when Earth ventures through trails of debris left behind by an ancient comet,"" according to NASA. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains on All Things Considered, NASA is expecting more meteors than usual this year ""because Jupiter's gravity has tugged some streams of comet material closer to Earth."" Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, tells Nell that a typical Perseid meteor shower ""has 80 to 100 meteor showers per hour."" But in the upcoming shower, ""we're going to have anywhere from 160 to 200 meteors per hour. So the rates are going to double this year."" Scientists are calling this an ""outburst"" — defined as a shower with an unusually high number of meteors. The latest outburst happened in 2009, according to NASA. And Cooke tells Nell that ""another outburst like this isn't expected until 2027 or so."" NASA has some background about the ancient comet from which these meteors came: ""Every Perseid meteor is a tiny piece of the comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun every 133 years. Each swing through the inner solar system can leave trillions of small particles in its wake. When Earth crosses paths with Swift-Tuttle's debris, specks of comet-stuff hit Earth's atmosphere and disintegrate in flashes of light. These meteors are called Perseids because they seem to fly out of the constellation Perseus."" As Cooke remarked to NASA, that means ""the meteors you'll see this year are from comet flybys that occurred hundreds if not thousands of years ago. ... And they've traveled billions of miles before their kamikaze run into Earth's atmosphere."" NASA's Rhiannon Blaauw shared some viewing tips if you want to watch Thursday evening's shower: Try to get away from bright lights. For city residents, it might help to try to go somewhere in the country. Give your eyes time to adjust to the dark. ""I would suggest just lying on your back and taking in as much of the sky as possible,"" she says. ""You don't want to look in any particular direction, just lie on your back and look straight up."" It can take about 45 minutes for your eyes to fully adjust, NASA says. Think about having some caffeine beforehand, she suggests, to stay awake for the late-night show. As Nell notes, the best time to catch the shower is between midnight and dawn. It'll be easiest to see the meteors after the moon sets in the early hours of Friday, according to NASA. You should be able to see meteors at some point over the next few days around the world — though as EarthSky explains, the number of meteors seen in the Southern Hemisphere typically isn't as high. If you live in a big city with a lot of light pollution (or somewhere cloudy), there are still ways to watch the show. NASA says there will still be meteor activity on Friday and Saturday. And if that doesn't work out, you can still watch a live stream of the shower here. NASA will be live overnight on Thursday and Friday, starting at 10 p.m. ET.","Try to get away from bright lights. For city residents, it might help to try to go somewhere in the country."

When this adorable video was recorded, baby Eliotte was only 4-months-old, and her nanny cat Watson was 7-years-old. Needless to say, these two are best friends. It seems that people simply can’t get enough of this wonderful duo because this video has been seen over a million times since it was posted back in 2010. As you’ll see in a bit, Watson rubs his baby sister and kneads his claws, which is his way of showering Eliotte with affection. Although some people may be against Mom’s decision to let these two play so closely, but it’s easy to see that Watson shows no aggressive or defensive behaviors. Watson is a natural-born parent at heart, and I have a feeling these two will be best friends for life.","Watson rubs his baby sister and kneads his claws, which is his way of showering Eliotte with affection"

996,"Michelle Obama gave the commencement address to graduates of City College in New York. While she was trying to inspire the students, Obama could not refrain from injecting race into it, as she always seems to do: ""It’s the story that I witness every single day, when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters – two beautiful, black young women – head off to school, waving goodbye to their father, the President of the United States... While I think it’s fair to say that our Founding Fathers never could have imagined this day... you are the fruits of their labor. Their legacy is very much your legacy.""

Virginia Kruta of IJR adds these important points: This is in addition to the fact that Mrs. Obama is herself a multi-millionaire, along with her Presidential husband, a graduate of Harvard University who is herself a walking symbol of the success that can come to anyone who is willing to work hard and apply one’s talent in America. In other words, even as Michelle Obama herself rebukes the nation’s history of racism, she is a living example that America has done much to overcome it. Kruta also refutes the offensive comment of Mrs. Obama that The Founders could ""never imagine"" a black person in The White House, when many specifically wanted to eliminate racial differences: ""The Deleted Passage in The Declaration of Independence"" written by Thomas Jefferson is but one example , though later removed to win the signatures of southern colonies: He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the Christian King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where Men should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he has obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the Liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another. The infamous three-fifths clause of The Constitution, although often ignorantly condemned as dehumanizing of slaves, was a strategic measure to erode the power of the southern states in The Congress, and ultimately lead to the slaves’ emancipation. A separate clause in The Constitution sought to eliminate the slave trade to American shores in twenty years’ time. Once again, the Obama’s never let historical facts get in the way of their race-baiting disses of America.",the White House was not built solely — or even primarily — by slaves.

The site is used by dieters as a modern version of sticking photos on the fridge, a support program without the hassle, public exposure or cost of joining a group in person. The Whole30 is one of seemingly endless like-minded communities that, for the most part, emphasize healthy living over weight loss. On the #WeightWatchers hashtag, there are more than 3.5 million posts dedicated to the diet, with a lot of before-and-after photos. People living the Paleo lifestyle — which focuses on basic foods ostensibly eaten by our prehistoric ancestors — have posted more than 7.5 million photos. And both are dwarfed by the #FitFam hashtag, a grab bag of nutrition, workout and fitness inspiration and memes that boasts a whopping 46 million posts. Melissa Hartwig, who has worked as a sports nutritionist and fitness instructor, cocreated the Whole30 program in 2009. A book, ""The Whole30,"" was published last year and has sold more than 500,000 copies. ""Not only do you want to feel like you belong to something bigger than yourself,"" Ms. Hartwig, 42, said, ""but it’s important to stay connected so you have the accountability and motivation."" Last year, Bonnie Spring, a professor in preventive medicine at the Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, published one of the few existing studies on why people turn to digital communities for weight loss. The report, called "" ‘Friending’ Your Way Thin,"" analyzed data from CalorieKing.com, an online weight-loss community. The study used nearly a year of anonymous data from 27,382 Calorie King users, including their age, height and weight, gender and activities like weigh-ins, friend requests and online communication. The scientists studied the frequency of online exchanges without looking at actual messages, but the members who were the most active with other members lost more weight, they found. The study found that Calorie King users who connected with 10 or more friends lost on average 8 percent of their body weight over six months, compared with an average of 5 percent weight loss among those who made between two and nine friends, and 4 percent for those who essentially ""watched"" but did not participate socially on the site. While the most-connected users in the Calorie King study lost the most weight, it’s notable that the less active users also lost a significant amount of weight. And losing even just 5 percent of your body weight improves your health, research shows. Some people flock to these online communities for active social support, and some are attracted because they want privacy and don’t want to share as much. Dr. Spring said the urge for privacy was found in a 2012 study by the Northwestern group, in which 96 people were given access to a chat application that encouraged a weight-loss competition. Researchers found that most of the people in the study did not want to share stories of weight loss. The few people who tried to do so were ignored or insulted by other group members. In a more recent test by the Northwestern researchers, 300 college students were asked to join a private Facebook group. That group is interacting with reading materials, but they’re still afraid of being ""that person"" who jumps in and shares their story, Dr. Spring said. Dr. Spring said that Instagram may have success as a dieting platform because it is actually ""a little bit less socially connected"" than other platforms, serving the online dieters who value privacy and want minimal interaction with others. ""Some people feel highly motivated and egged on to succeed when they can post their accomplishments on a leader board and compare their progress to others’,"" Dr. Spring said. ""Others cave under that kind of pressure and public scrutiny."" I fell into the latter category. When I was plugged into the Whole30, I found that Instagram could be a cheap way to keep myself motivated without trumpeting my journey to the world. Kacie Carter, a nutrition consultant who lives in Los Angeles and often posts Whole30 recipes to Instagram, said she warns her clients to keep a healthy balance between using platforms like Instagram for inspiration and being realistic about their own goals. ""Social media accounts have a tendency to promote everything as being perfect and rosy,"" she said, ""That stress can and does offset the benefits from the healthier lifestyle they are trying to create."" After my Whole30 was done, I returned to tracking my eating and exercise habits. But it was nice to know that if I need to locate an adventurous guac recipe, I have a few good hashtags at the ready.","The site is used by dieters as a modern version of sticking photos on the fridge, a support program without the hassle, public exposure or cost of joining a group in person."

This week U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson sentenced him to eight months’ home detention and 24 months’ probation, in addition to the fine. Morarity had been facing a maximum sentence of up to three years in federal prison. Using the screen name ""clutchit,"" Morarity uploaded ""The Revenant"" to a torrent website called Pass the Popcorn six days before the movie’s debut in a limited theatrical release on Christmas Day 2015, according to authorities. More than 1 million users downloaded the film over a six-week period, causing Fox to lose more than $1 million. ""The defendant’s illegal conduct caused significant harm to the victim movie studio,"" Eileen M. Decker, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement. ""The fact that the defendant stole these films while working on the lot of a movie studio makes his crime more egregious."" ""The Revenant"" ended up grossing $183.6 million at the U.S. box office, plus $349.3 million internationally, according to Box Office Mojo. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and star Leonardo DiCaprio both won Academy Awards for their work on the film. According to officials, Morarity has agreed to assist the FBI in producing a public service announcement about the harms of copyright infringement and piracy. Morarity copied the Fox screeners onto a portable drive and uploaded the movies from his home computer on Dec. 17 and 19, 2015.","A federal judge this week ordered a California man who had pleaded guilty to stealing copies of ""The Revenant"" and ""The Peanuts Movie"" from 20th Century Fox and sharing them illegally via a piracy website to pay the studio $1.12 million in restitution."
1026,"The teen birthrate has plummeted rapidly since the mid-2000s — and a new study suggests better use of birth control is entirely responsible. There are 42 percent fewer teen births now than just seven years ago. In 2007, 4.2 percent of teenage girls in the United States gave birth. In 2014, the rate was 2.4 percent. This is an incredibly fast change in a public health trend, and it’s left some researchers puzzled over how it happened so quickly. But researchers Laura Lindberg, John Santelli, and Sheila Desai say it’s not a mystery at all. Writing in the Journal of Adolescent Health, they find that teenage girls in 2012 were just as likely to be sexually active as girls in 2007. Survey research shows that 43 percent of girls between 15 and 19 said they’d ever had sex in 2007, compared with 45 percent in 2012. What changed was how teenage girls used contraceptives. The percentage of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex rose from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2012. More teens gravitated toward better types of birth control — like pills, IUDs, or implants — rather than relying on lower-quality birth control like condoms. This study only included data through 2012, and, as the researchers note, it’s possible the narrative could be changing. Newer data that runs through 2015 is starting to show a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls. ""It is unclear whether these new data represent a new trend or are the result of other factors,"" the study authors write of the new figures. But if this is the start of a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls, that suggests the steep declines in teen pregnancy might not just continue — they might reach new historic lows.

Whitney Houston’s rendition of the Star-Spangled banner at the Super Bowl is considered one of the best performances of the song of all time. With so many incredible artists singing this song, it is difficult to differentiate your version from the rest. However, Chloe and Halle Bailey’s version of the National Anthem at the BET Experience’s Sprite Celebrity Awards is unlike any rendition I have ever heard and it blew the entire audience away. These teen sisters grew up in Atlanta, Georgia but eventually moved to Los Angeles with their family to pursue careers in music. Their YouTube channel is what has really launched them into the music industry, singing incredible covers that garner millions of views. These girls have an insane amount of talent. Their voices show the utmost display of control and skill and they blend together in such a beautiful way. I am simply blown away by their clever harmonies and strategic pauses, it is no wonder they were recently signed to Beyonce’s Parkwood Entertainment. You need to hear this performance for yourself to understand just how amazing it is. It starts off pretty normal, but as soon as they both started singing together, I had goosebumps. I think this pair is making an excellent example for young girls everywhere in empowering them to do what they love and to follow those dreams. I am still in awe by how unique this performance is and I have no doubt that we will be seeing more from Chloe and Halle in the future!",artists sing their renditions in an attempt to make the song memorable and their own
1030,"Ketchup is awful. That’s not an opinion, that’s a fact. Remember that horrible little ginger kid from Problem Child, the tiny sociopath hiding behind a saccharine smile and stupid red bowtie? That’s ketchup, America’s snotty-nosed baby bro, beaming away while he tortures cats and shoves dirty sweat socks into his grandfather’s mouth. And for some godforsaken reason, America just can’t get enough of it. Ketchup is a beastly condiment, squashing beautiful flavors with the indiscriminate brutality of Ramsay Bolton. We are a nation obsessed, just ask Stephen Colbert. Recently, the late-night host’s hidden Colbert Condiment Cam captured GOP Convention goers sweating it out in an 120 minute line all for a few measly burger-topping pumps. Then, as if it couldn't get any worse, the comedic genius’ DNC cam caught a mysterious Democratic delegate gruesomely tossing back ketchup shots like some 7th grader on a lunchroom dare. Have we, as a people, lost our manners, our decency, our minds? These are grown men and women, for crying out loud, our elected leaders sporting firetruck-hued stains on their lapels like American flag pins. Emails-schmemails -- turns out the real crooked pols are squirting sticky red streaks from from both sides of the aisle. Ketchup is hands down the beastliest of all condiments, squashing beautiful flavors with the indiscriminate brutality of Ramsay Bolton. It has no regard for harmony, no respect for the craft of cooking, the love and care that goes into preparing every subtle note, every delicate detail. And to add insult to injury, those who enjoy it tend to hose down their dinner plates like they’re putting out a fire. Slather ketchup on a cheeseburger and it’s practically impossible to spot the difference between Daniel Boulud’s $140 Royale Double Truffle Burger and a day-old White Castle Slider. The only thing worse than ordering a nice of steak well-done? Asking for a side of ketchup with it. It’s a chef’s bloody nightmare. I’m not saying mayo and mustard are the picture of health, but ketchup truly phones it in. Also, it’s flat-out terrible for you. I’m not saying mayo and mustard are the picture of health, but ketchup truly phones it in. Most name-brand varieties are loaded with not one but two different types of GMO-derived high fructose corn syrups, contain a negligible amount of actual tomato paste, and are bursting with enough sodium to kill a hamster (an untested theory, but I’d put $5 on it). Sure, the label might claim a single serving weighs in at mere 20 calories, but how often does a ketchup head hang up the bottle after just one tablespoon? It’s so comically unhealthy that when President Reagan tried to classify ketchup as a vegetable in order to cut school lunch costs, Republican Senator John Heinz, (yes, that Heinz), famously called the idea ""one of the most ridiculous regulations I ever heard of"" -- and that’s from a guy who probably had ketchup in his baby bottle. Even I’ve fallen prey to ketchup’s command. Growing up in the Midwest, I assumed ketchup was merely part of life, squirting it onto hot dogs and hamburgers like there was no other option. I don’t remember lapping it up, but I do recall consuming it, at least until 1st grade. That was when Brendon Allen started bringing ketchup-and-bologna sandwiches to school on the daily, filling the entire classroom with a gag-inducing, fetid odor, cloyingly sweet with layers of saliva-sucking salt. The poor schlub would sit there at his desk with a fistful of oozing white bread, bright red Heinz 57 stretched across his face like The Joker. That kind of vulgarity, you simply can’t unsee. And it didn’t end there. Years later, I found myself charged with washing dishes in the school dining hall. My murky bin of rinse water was gnarly from the get, but as soon as that first ketchup-smeared plate entered the mix, I knew shit was about to get much, much worse. Have you ever smelled the smell of warm, wet ketchup water, that sickly combo of Bloody Mary mix and putrid apple cider vinegar, of rancid tomato sauce and vomit? Trust me, if you had, you’d hate that garbage, too. Even street-food connoisseur Anthony Bourdain has a few words for the ketchup-minded. Speaking of righteous condiment crusaders, I’ve got some heavy hitters in my corner. Louis’ Lunch, the century old Connecticut institution that reputedly invented the hamburger, famously bans the sludge and threatens to 86 anyone who dares B.Y.O.K. for LIFE. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council (this is a real thing that exists) goes as far as to deem dressing a dog with ketchup completely unacceptable over the age of 18. Can’t imagine a pup without the ‘chup? Just ask any self-respecting Chicagoan -- they’ll set you straight. Even street-food connoisseur Anthony Bourdain has a few words for the ketchup-minded. ""Do not put ketchup on your hot dogs,"" he warned viewers in the Chicago episode of Travel Channel’s The Layover. ""Be assured God doesn't want you to do that."" These are my people: the few, the proud, the ketchup-less. As the late Pulitzer Prize-winner Mike Royko once said, ""if someone wants to put ketchup on a hot dog and actually eat the awful thing, that is their right. It is also their right to put mayo or chocolate syrup or toenail clippings or cat hair on a hot dog. Sure, it would be disgusting and perverted, and they would be shaming themselves and their loved ones. But under our system of government, it is their right to be barbarians."" So, to all you bottle-squeezing sheeple out there, if you want to ruin your food, be my guest -- it’s a free country after all. Just be careful not to end up on the wrong side of history.","loaded with not one but two different types of GMO-derived high fructose corn syrups, contain a negligible amount of actual tomato paste, and are bursting with enough sodium to kill a hamster (an untested theory, but I’d put $5 on it)"

1039,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Thinkstock. This post originally appeared on Inside Higher Ed. The key to making online students focus on their coursework may be making procrastination as unenjoyable as possible, according to a study out of Cornell University. It’s a familiar problem to anyone with a deadline and a computer: The assignment is open on the screen, half-finished, but is quickly lost in a stack of Web browser tabs. Upon rediscovery (with an accompanying pang of guilt), the procrastinator resolves to buckle down and type out the last few paragraphs—right after clearing the notification that just popped up and checking just one more website. Richard W. Patterson, a Ph.D. student in policy analysis and management at Cornell, wanted to see if software could reduce procrastination and, as a result, improve students’ grades. ""People frequently fail to follow through on the plans they make: They fail to meet deadlines at work, finish assignments for school, go to the gym, and deposit money in their savings accounts,"" Patterson writes in the report, titled ""Can Behavioral Tools Improve Online Student Outcomes? Experimental Evidence From a Massive Open Online Course,"" published by the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute. In higher education, Patterson writes, that failure to follow through can be seen in the number of students who enroll in degree programs but never graduate. His study looked specifically at online education, where completion rates are lower than in face-to-face programs. MOOCs in particular have been sharply criticized for completion rates that sometimes register in the single digits. Patterson’s report, written last November but released this month, examines the effects of different types of anti-distraction software. His study looked at 657 students enrolled in a statistics MOOC offered by Stanford University. The students, all of whom agreed to download software that would track their activity online, were separated into three groups, plus a control group. Students in the group that tested a commitment tool set their own daily allotments for time they could spend on distracting websites such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and Facebook. If the students hit the cap during the course of a day, the software blocked them from the distracting sites, forcing students to give new reasons every time they wanted to unblock one. Students who used the commitment tool were 81 percent more likely to say the tool made procrastination less enjoyable. On average, students allotted 2.7 hours per day to spend on distracting websites and went over that limit four times during the nine-week MOOC. Even though the software sent them a daily email at 6:45 a.m. reminding them of that limit and asking if they wanted to reset it, the students only did so once on average. Students in the reminder group received notifications with links back to the course after every 30 minutes they spent on distracting websites. The notifications triggered an average of 48 times for each student in that group. Finally, students in the focus group were given the option to block access to distractions for 15, 30 ,or 60 minutes when they accessed the course. Students in that group activated that feature only 1.7 times on average during the MOOC, blocking distractions for 38 minutes. Only students testing the commitment tool showed statistically distinguishable performance improvements. Compared with those in the control group, the students spent 24 percent more time on coursework (or 5.5 hours), submitted 27 percent more homework assignments, and were 40 percent more likely to finish the MOOC. Their grades were also 0.29 standard deviations higher than those of students in the control group, which is ""roughly the same difference in course performance observed between students with Ph.D.s or M.D.s and students with bachelor’s degrees,"" according to the report. Patterson said he approached the study expecting the results from the first group to produce the most promising results, as that software in some ways included features tested in the other two groups. ""With the commitment device, you’d get an email asking if you would like to reset your limit—so it kind of acted like a reminder,"" Patterson said. ""It also had the incapacitating effect once you reached your limit that the focus study session included, but it also included this goal aspect of setting your own limit. I have a feeling that might be the most effective—adding something important on top."" The results suggest a second reason for why the commitment tool was the most effective of those tested: Students in that group were 81 percent more likely than those in the control group to say the tool made procrastination less enjoyable. In other words, the software made wasting time a hassle, causing some students to go back to studying instead. Yet the results also present some limitations to anti-distraction software. Those most likely to benefit from software were those who, in a pre-course survey, said completing the MOOC was ""very"" or ""extremely"" important to them, leaving the question of how to help students who lack self-motivation largely unresolved, Patterson said. Patterson, who will this fall join the economics faculty at the United States Military Academy, said researching student behavior allowed him to face his own tendency to procrastinate.",Make It As Unenjoyable As Possible

1065,"The two-week break in between the conference title games and Super Bowl LI has allowed for an in-depth exploration of pretty much every angle associated with the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots: Bill Belichick's shifting wardrobe, Matt Ryan's mysterious nickname and a Georgia gas station no longer selling Sam Adams. It might be overwhelming for some to keep up with every storyline. With that in mind, let this serve as your cheat sheet. Here is what you need to know if you plan on placing a wager, making a prediction or just want to sound smart when talking about the big game. The Patriots' defense is not as good as the scoring numbers indicate. New England led the NFL in fewest points allowed during the regular season, but that ranking doesn't tell the full story. According to Football Outsiders, the Patriots faced the easiest slate of opposing offenses. They ranked 16th in defensive efficiency -- 23rd against the pass and fourth against the run. Granted, New England has shown steady improvement, but the Patriots now face a Falcons unit that played the second-toughest slate of defenses and still led the league in scoring and efficiency. What makes Atlanta so good? It's not just about stopping one or two guys. The Falcons take advantage of different matchups on a weekly basis. According to Elias, Matt Ryan threw touchdowns to 13 different receivers in the regular season -- the most of any quarterback in NFL history. To label the Falcons' offense vs. the Patriots' defense as strength vs. strength is a stretch. Atlanta has a sizable edge. Betting on the big game? Here's the best content from Chalk, ESPN.com's gambling section. Chris Berman's pick » Ultimate betting guide » Printable prop bet scorecard » Biggest Super Bowl LI bets » Rufus Peabody's best bets » Vegas oddsmakers, celebrity picks » Vegas bookmaker roundtable » The Falcons' defense will need a new formula. On the flip side, it's nearly impossible to come up with a scenario in which Atlanta will be able to slow down Tom Brady & Co. In two postseason wins, the Falcons switched up their approach. In the regular season, they blitzed (defined here as five pass-rushers or more) 16.9 percent of the time -- the third-lowest rate in the NFL. But in victories over the Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers, Dan Quinn's team dialed up the pressure, blitzing 36 percent of the time, and it paid off. The problem going into this game is a similar plan will likely result in disaster. Brady has posted a Total QBR of 92.1 against the blitz this season, tops in the NFL. Per ESPN Stats & Information, 44 percent of the sacks the Patriots allowed this season were by players who lined up as interior defensive linemen or inside linebackers. That was the highest percentage in the league and probably a good indicator of where the Falcons will attack. Unlike the Pittsburgh Steelers, look for Atlanta to play a lot of man coverage. But if the Falcons can't produce pressure with their front four, they'll have a tough time winning this game. The best prop bet on the board involves gambling on Stephen Curry. (Editor's note: This was written before Saturday's Warriors-Kings game in which Curry had 35 points and nine assists.) Curry's combined points and assists against the Sacramento Kings is -2.5 against the Patriots and Falcons' combined first-half points. Curry is averaging 25 points and 6.1 assists per game for a projected total of 31.1. That should get a little bump, considering he's going up against a Kings team that is allowing 106.1 points per game (10th-most in the NBA). Curry had 30 points and six assists against Sacramento in a game last month. But even conservatively estimating a total of 31 for Curry, the bet still wins if the halftime score is 14-14 or 17-10. That's easy money. Last year's cheat sheet delivered a Curry-related winner. And this year's will as well. Lady Gaga earned this opportunity. It has become trendy to rip on Super Bowl halftime performers, but she delivered an epic national anthem before last year's game and now gets a chance for a bigger stage. The favorite for her first song is ""Bad Romance"" at -115. The best value bet -- not that I've spent hours thinking about this or anything -- is ""The Edge of Glory"" at +900. While the other musical guests have not been revealed, here's one suggestion: Paper Boi. The Falcons are in the Super Bowl. ""Atlanta"" just won a Golden Globe. The timing couldn't be any more perfect. This is the kind of opportunity the NFL cannot miss out on if it wants to be considered a forward-thinking league. One more musical note: Quinn apparently puts a lot of thought into the playlists at Falcons practices. He had a New York day featuring The Notorious B.I.G. and Nas and played Ice Cube before a game against the Oakland Raiders. NFL Films caught part of Quinn's postgame speech after the NFC title game in which he closed with, ""Hey, in the words of DMX, we've got one more road to cross!"" Quinn might not have been the coach all Falcons fans wanted two years ago. But he's the coach they needed. The biggest factor working against the Falcons is their red zone defense. Opponents averaged 5.69 points per red zone trip against Atlanta during the regular season, the second-worst mark in the NFL. Brady has completed 69.3 percent of his passes in the red zone (tops in the league), throwing 24 touchdowns and one interception. One reason why the Patriots are so tough to defend is because it's impossible to predict what they're going to do from a personnel standpoint. In the entire regular season, New England used four-wide receiver sets just 10 times. Against the Steelers in the AFC title game, they did so on 17 snaps. Overall, the Patriots used 13 different personnel groupings in the AFC title game. The Falcons have a young defense. Their rookies on that side of the ball played more snaps (3,071 snaps) than any other in the NFL, per ESPN Stats & Information. Playing well against Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers should give them confidence, but slowing Brady down -- specifically in the red zone -- will be their biggest challenge. Someone (actually at least two people) bet on the Patriots to score exactly two points. ESPN's David Purdum has a list out of some of the biggest and most intriguing bets that have been placed in Vegas. As of last Sunday, the WestGate SuperBook had taken two wagers on the Patriots to score exactly two points. The payout: 9,999 to 1. In other words, throw in 10 bucks and cash in $99,990 if it hits. While there is no reason to think this bet has any chance of being a winner, the excitement level an early Patriots safety could create would be unmatched. And in case you missed it: An excellent breakdown of the Falcons' 15 go-to plays on offense. ... Belichick thought Julio Jones had trouble getting open on intermediate routes and had inconsistent hands coming out of college. ... How a Patriots Super Bowl ring gave new life to 24 orphans. ... And Americans will wager an estimated $4.7 billion on Sunday's game.",The best prop bet on the board involves gambling on Stephen Curry.

1071,"- Albay Representative Joey Salceda blamed Pokémon Go players for worsening the Metro Manila traffic situation - The congressman expressed opposition to the recent ban on provincial buses in EDSA - The congressman said that while playing the game, the players would normally slow down causing traffic jams in major roads Metro Manila traffic is probably one of the worst problems that commuters and the general public could ever experience. The government has long been the subject of public criticism for not solving the issue which is killing the productivity of workers. Recently, the government has issued a ban on provincial buses in EDSA. The proposal received various reactions from the public. Albay Representative Joey Salceda. Photo from alchetron.com Some said that while provincial buses cause traffic, the proposed action will not solve the entirety of the issue. According to some, the ban is anti-poor. This is because the main mode of transportation of those who cannot travel using their own cars is through provincial buses. There are also those who work in the Metro and travel through provincial buses day and night. In an interview recently, Albay Rep. Joey Salceda did not only expressed opposition to the proposal but suggested that there could be something else causing the traffic. The congressman said that Pokémon Go players are to be blamed for aggravating the traffic situation in Metro Manila. Pokémon Go has been released recently with many people jumping in the bandwagon of playing the virtual reality game. The game involves travelling to catch and collect Pocket Monsters (Pokémonn) which sometimes, private car owners roam around major roads just to play the game. ""Why pick on our pobreng provincianos to solve Metro Manila traffic? Pokémon-playing is a greater aggravation of Metro Manila traffic,"" he said. ""Pokémon-playing in private cars pose more threat of aggravation to Metro Manila traffic than provincial buses,"" he added while explaining as to how the players cause traffic. He narrated that Pokémon Go players would normally slow down just to catch the characters of the virtual reality game. ""If you are rich enough to maintain a private car, you must be rich enough to (afford for) yourself and your kids an Android, iPad or iPhone. Multiply that by the 2.5 million cars in Metro Manila,"" the representative said. -Kami Media","while playing the game, the players would normally slow down causing traffic jams in major roads"
1072,"Rachel Roy has been in hiding ever since she was outed as being the home wrecker on Beyoncé 's Lemonade , so we were all surprised when the designer and pop icon were both spotted at the same event this week: the CFDA Fashion Awards, where Bey was given the Icon Award. Well, turns out, ""Becky"" took her good hair and ran straight out the building as soon as she saw Queen Bey coming. According to Page Six, Rachel Roy hastily left the building as soon as rumors started circulating that the Carters were dropping in on the event unexpectedly — of course, it's not like Bey would RSVP — to avoid Bey's death stare. Whispers of the Carters surprise arrival started as soon as the lights went down. One fashion writer tweeted, ""Jay Z has just arrived... What could it mean?"" Then Beyoncé’s daughter, Blue Ivy, and mom, Tina Knowles Lawson, showed up, making it clear that the Queen was on her way. Roy, apparently, took that as her cue and dashed before Beyoncé entered the building. ""She disappeared with her place card and never came back,"" said a source. ""[It was] weird. I don’t know if it was because she’s ‘Becky,’ or what?"" Another stunned source at the event said, ""Rachel just came and left."" While Rachel's official excuse is that she had to catch an early flight to LA to be with her kids, this latest display of bizarre behavior isn't doing anything to squash those Becky rumors.

1079,"The former ICAP Plc broker stood near the bar, pint of cider in hand, surrounded by members of his house music collective, Hellsinki-V. Clad in their signature mad scientist garb -- lab coats and 3D glasses -- Danny Wilkinson and his bandmates were celebrating with pre-holiday merrymakers in London’s trendy Hoxton Square. It has been a busy year, with gigs ranging from the Lechlade Music Festival, in England’s Cotswolds, to Ibiza. For Wilkinson, the band is a second act -- part job, part lark -- after his career in finance abruptly ended. He was one of dozens of traders and brokers fired after being implicated in a global conspiracy to rig the London interbank offered rate, a key interest-rate benchmark. Even though he was acquitted at trial of manipulating Libor, he was effectively exiled from the industry. ""After 25 years in the City, I suddenly found myself at home thinking ‘what do I do now?""’ said Wilkinson, 50, who used to earn as much as 1 million pounds ($1.2 million) a year. ""I’d DJ’d at lots of acid house parties in the 80s and I always had a love of music."" Now, he DJ’s on a radio station on weekends and plays regular club nights and festivals with the band. He said it’s not full time, but they’re getting more bookings, and the group is gearing up to release a new single -- a remix of Baby D’s 1990s hit "" Let Me Be Your Fantasy."" He splits the rest of the week between markets around Essex and London, and fulfilling gardening contracts at local businesses, with his springer spaniel, Lily, in tow. Farr, 45, said he makes about 10 percent of the six-figure salary he used to earn. ""Even though I was tried and found innocent, you’re tarred with that brush,"" said Farr, who has returned to the sort of work he did with his father when growing up. ""I do miss working in London. I miss that sort of buzz of the dealing room."" Those cast adrift after the Libor scandal and the foreign-exchange manipulation probe that followed it are a tiny subset of the thousands of City workers who’ve lost their jobs since the financial crisis in 2008. The end of the debt-fueled banking boom ushered in a period of shrinking profits, heightened regulatory scrutiny and little tolerance for those accused of wrongdoing. ""Libor changed the game for the rehabilitation of a career in finance,"" says Richard Burger, a lawyer at London firm RPC who used to work at the U.K. markets regulator. ""Even if a person is exonerated, it’s often seen as too big a risk to take."" Brent Davies, who left ICAP over Libor, has used his height, husky build and shoulder-length blond hair to get work in films as an extra, according to his profile on The Casting Collective Ltd., an agency that provides walk-ons. His roles have included a member of the rebel alliance under Colonel Akbar in ""Star Wars: Episode VII-The Force Awakens.""  Extras earn, on average, about 100 pounds a day, or more if the actor is asked to do anything out of the ordinary, like work in the rain, according to the agency. Davies declined to be interviewed through his lawyer. For some, the change wasn’t unwelcome. Perry Stimpson, 55, said he was already considering leaving the industry when Citigroup Inc. fired him in 2014 over the currency-rigging scandal that cost banks $10 billion in fines. He’s now managing a property development and rental business. Stimpson, who worked at the U.S. bank for more than 20 years, is one of more than a dozen traders who sued his employer over his dismissal in the foreign-exchange probe. He won the suit and was awarded 58,774 pounds in March. Out of banking, he can spend more time with his adolescent kids, and definitely gets more sleep. ""There are a lot of silver linings,"" he said. For Wilkinson, gone is the daily 5:39 a.m. train commute from Essex to London, the days matching orders and the late evenings entertaining clients. Now, he’s more apt to be heading into London to begin a night of DJ’ing rather than staggering home. In the old days, ""normally I’m the drunk bloke at Liverpool Street trying to get on the 11:50 p.m."" train home, he said. ""I then found myself getting off the 11:50 p.m. with a record box and me headphones, and all the brokers are trying to push past me with their kebabs, and I’m like, ‘this is so surreal.""’","Now, he DJ’s on a radio station on weekends and plays regular club nights and festivals with the band."

1083,"Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump was on stage at Monday's opening session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump was on stage at Monday's opening session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Rick Wilking—Reuters Why Donald Trump's Speech at the Republican Convention Was Historic When he took the stage in Cleveland Thursday, Donald Trump was the first major-party nominee since at least 1960 to speak for the first time at a national convention, according to a TIME review of past convention speeches. Typically, modern major party nominees have been on the convention stage before in at least a small role, often selected in part because they were rising stars or runners-up in that year's primary fight. Trump was supposed to do a ""surprise"" publicity stunt at the 2012 convention, but it was canceled when a tropical storm hit Tampa. These earlier convention speeches have even launched careers. In 2004, Illinois Senate candidate Barack Obama rocketed to national fame after a well-received speech at the Democratic national convention. Four years later, he was the party's nominee. Even poorly reviewed speeches, such as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's famously meandering address in 1988, have been clues to future nominations. Other nominees have been onstage because of their close ties to a prior administration, such as Vice Presidents Al Gore, George H.W. Bush and Walter Mondale, or family ties, such as George W. Bush, who spoke on his father's behalf. But some nominees are veterans of the convention stage. Arizona Sen. John McCain spoke at five conventions— 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004 —before accepting the party's nomination in 2008. He even made a return appearance in 2012, though facing a tough re-election campaign complicated by disapproval of Trump in his home state, he will not speak at this year's convention. Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis spoke at the 1976 Democratic convention and again at the 1984 convention, though ""it was pretty late at night!"" he told TIME in an email. Dukakis was nominated in 1988. Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, spoke for her husband twice before taking the stage as a politician in her own right in 2000, 2004 and 2008. (She skipped the 2012 convention because the Secretary of State typically stays away from domestic politics.) If recent history is a guide, delegates at this year's convention may even get a sneak peek at their party's nominee in 2020 or 2024. Among the possibilities: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's running mate; Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a rising star in the party; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the failed presidential candidate; and Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the nominee.",first major-party nominee since at least 1960 to speak for the first time at a national convention
1084,"It's not news to anyone that when the president comes to town, he comes with a ton of security. But when the president comes to a small island in the middle of the Pacific -- a small island that is already home to the nation's second worst traffic -- his security apparatus is a bit more noticeable. The entire island of Oahu is essentially turned over to the Secret Service for the president's two week Christmas vacation, and while he limits his movements to a pretty predictable area, the security measures still affect tourists and locals alike. By Land: Concrete blockades and security patrols block the entrance to the neighborhood where the president stays and ""no parking"" signs keep the streets clear. Doug Miller lives just outside the security check-points and has devised a system using a little Chia Obama likeness to communicate Obama's movements to his neighbors. ""When we have him facing down the road that means that he's still out -- the motorcade is out,"" Miller told Hawaii News Now, ""but if he's come in and is in residence then we just turn it back facing the place that he's staying. It's our little indication of whether the President is in residence or not."" Obama's rental home also undergoes a bit of an upgrade. While the existing security systems are disabled, bullet proof glass is installed as are additional, secure phone lines. As always, the president travels with 20-30 vehicles, which makes a noticeable impact on Honolulu's already strained traffic. Obama's sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, who lives in Hawaii, asked residents for their patience and understanding during the vacation. ""Please forgive any traffic that is increased or made more dense as a result of his arrival,"" she said, ""and know that he and the rest of the family are very thankful for this chance to find a retreat."" A US Secret Service Agent talks to people at a checkpoint for the area where President Barack Obama and his family are staying in Kailua. By Sea: The Coast Guard enforces a temporary security zone in the waters of Kailua Bay, near the president's rental home. Officials have contacted boat owners in the area to remind them that the canal and surf spots facing the home are off limits, and armed Coast Guard dinghies line the banks of the canal. Any person entering the zone without the permission of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port is subject to a penalty up to $40,000 or a criminal penalty resulting in imprisonment of up to 10 years. Unfortunately, the Secret Service's strategy for protecting against sharks and jellyfish remains classified. A Coast Guard dinghie patrols the canal near Obama's rental home. By Air: The FAA files ""temporary flight restrictions for VIP Movement"" during the president's stay. Any aircraft within a 30 nautical mile radius -- which, we'll point out, encompasses the entire island of Oahu -- must apply for special approval to fly from the FAA. If you think this only affects commercial planes, think again. Oahu is home to a bustling tourism industry of helicopter tours, hang-gliding tours, and skydiving companies, all of which are affected to some degree by the FAA restrictions. Frank Hinshaw of Skydive Hawaii says that he's ""very grateful to be flying while the president is in town,"" but his planes are grounded if the president decides to take a trip to the North Shore. ""We're closed while he's in our vicinity,"" Henshaw says. That's because the FAA has more strict restrictions for what it calls the ""inner core,"" the 10 nautical mile radius that follows the president's movements. Only approved law enforcement and military flights directly supporting the Secret Service are allowed in this space, although exceptions are made for ""lifesaving"" or ambulance flights with proper approval. If a wayward skydiving plane were to violate this airspace, two armed F-16s would appear out of nowhere to dance circles around the intruder and escort the aircraft down. Military helicopters patrol Waikiki Beach.","The entire island of Oahu is essentially turned over to the Secret Service for the president's two week Christmas vacation, and while he limits his movements to a pretty predictable area, the security measures still affect tourists and locals alike."
1086,"To an obsessive observer of Pinterest trends (which I am), one thing that seems to differ between the popular pins of women and men — or at least what the company said are the popular male pins — is the overall quality of the photos and the buy-ability. That is, the photos Pinterest said men pin were more likely to be products linked to a merchandiser’s site than just a photo of a person wearing that item. And while some of the most repinned photos on Pinterest at large might be a gritty shot of a beige casserole or someone’s random gray hallway, the top male pins the company sent BuzzFeed Life all looked professionally produced. This could be related to Pinterest’s new partnership with brands, which can promote pins targeted to certain interests or demographics, or because of Pinterest’s own work to increase their number of male users by saturating the men’s fashion and other traditionally masculine categories. Or, maybe men just like looking at pretty pictures.",products linked to a merchandiser’s site
1087,"For 70 Years, A Mug In Auschwitz Held A Secret Treasure From the outside, it looked like any of the other mugs in the Auschwitz museum. But on the inside, this one had a secret — faithfully kept for seven decades. A false bottom concealed a gold necklace and a gold ring inlaid with stones. The enameled mug was one of more than 12,000 pieces of kitchenware that Nazis stole from people sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland. ""The Germans incessantly lied to the Jews deported for extermination,"" Dr. Piotr M.A. Cywinski, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, said in a statement. ""They were told about resettlement, work and life in a different location."" But the Nazis would allow Jews to take only a small amount of luggage. It was a calculated move: If you were going to start a new life, and could only take a small bag, you'd fill it with your most precious possessions. So when a victim arrived at Auschwitz, the Germans could be confident they'd be able to loot their luggage and find valuables. Victims often tried to hide costly possessions from sight. On one hand, Cywinski says, that's proof that Jewish families were well aware that their belongings would be looted during their deportation. But it's also a heartbreaking reminder of how much people didn't know about the fate they faced at Auschwitz. Every effort to hide valuables ""shows that the Jewish families constantly had a ray of hope that these items will be required for their existence,"" Cywinski says. ""Despite the passage of more than 70 years since the liberation of the German Nazi concentration and extermination camp, there are still cases of accidental discovery of objects hidden by the victims,"" the museum statement read. And that's what happened with the mug, which was being examined as part of routine work at the museum when the false bottom was discovered. Beneath, there was a necklace coiled in a circle and wrapped in canvas, and a ring with some stones remaining in the setting. ""It was very well hidden, however, due to the passage of time, the materials underwent gradual degradation, and the second bottom separated from the mug,"" Hanna Kubik of the Memorial Collections said in the museum's statement. The museum says that while every find is ""carefully documented,"" it is often impossible to connect a personal item to the victim who owned it because of a a lack of identifying characteristics. ""The jewellery found in the mug will be stored in the Collections of the Museum in the form reflecting the manner in which it had been hidden by the owner, as a testimony to the fate of the Jews deported to the German Nazi concentration and extermination camp,"" the museum writes. More than 1 million prisoners, mostly Jews, died at Auschwitz during the Holocaust.",A false bottom concealed a gold necklace and a gold ring inlaid with stones.
1088,"With waif-like fashion models filling the pages of magazines, it's easy to lose sight of the diverse spectrum of body types out there... and to stigmatize anything less than ""perfect."" It's also no mystery what this homogeneity does to a woman's self-esteem. But the answer isn't to just toss in a second stereotypical ""plus-size"" body type to counteract the effect of the skinny one. Tyra Banks, currently on a campaign with Special K to ban fat talk and promote positive body image, told HuffPost Style that the labels that separate women are also harmful: ""I don't like the label 'plus-size' -- I call it 'fiercely real.' On 'Top Model,' we call it fiercely real. I don't want to use the term 'plus-size,' because, to me, what the hell is that? It just doesn't have a positive connotation to it. I tend to not use it."" And she practices what she preaches. In 2008, Tyra crowned the ""fiercely real"" Whitney Thompson the winner of ""Top Model"" Cycle 10, with the press labeling her the show's first ""plus-size"" victor. Two years later, Tyra launched the ""Fiercely Real Model Search"" for plus-size teens. Incorporating more diverse body types ""plus-size"" and otherwise, should be the norm, Tyra says. ""We just need to make sure it's not a trend and that it's something that's normal, because this stuff comes in waves and it would be nice to see it become constant,"" she told us. Despite the increasing influence of plus-size models and curvier women like Kate Upton, use of the term ""plus-size"" remains a contentious issue. Jennie Runk, H&M's first plus-size model, believes that the term has practical function, explaining recently, ""Clothing companies do this in order to offer their customers exactly what they're looking for, making it easier for people of all sizes to find clothes that fit their bodies as well as their own unique stylistic expression."" But surveys have shown that many of the so-called ""plus-size"" women prefer the term ""curvy."" At the end of the day, how we see ourselves is certainly influenced by bodies we see in media and the terms that come with them. The trick, Tyra says, is to stop comparing yourself to other women and find the positive ways to describe what your great attributes are. ""Not everyone can look like Kate Upton,"" she says. ""Kate Upton's body, as curvy as she is, to a lot of people that's still thin.""",doesn't have a positive connotation to it

The Answer It's a hard question to answer, for sure, but one fan, Sahil Juneja (who has read each book 16 times!), had an awesome answer: ""Neville could have been the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. Had Voldemort chosen Neville instead of Harry, Lily would still be alive. People who joined the 'Snape Fan Club' after his memories revealed him to be someone who sacrificed his entire life for his love, forgot that Snape always was a vile person. He was full of hatred, and he wanted to prove himself to be a better, smarter and stronger (magically) wizard than most."" 8. Theory Continued He continued to explain: ""For years since Lily's death, he blamed no one but himself. He turned coats for Dumbledore in order for some penance but that wasn't enough of course. He still loved Lily and couldn't bear that thought. And one fine day, Neville Longbottom came along. The living embodiment of his guilt. He manifested all his anger and hatred for himself onto that poor little boy. It was more likely a subconscious thing. The sight of Neville triggered the guilt and he couldn't stand it."" CAN'T. DEAL. WITH. THESE. EMOTIONS. 9. Neville, The Hero This is so much — Snape's love for Lily Potter truly eclipsed everything. Even the fact that Neville was just a sweet boy turned incredible hero. 10. Tragic Ending...Of Course Of course, Snape had his tragic ending and Neville played a pivotal role in the Wizarding War. It's upsetting these two could never work out their differences, but then the books wouldn't be the perfect creations we're obsessed with until this day.",He manifested all his anger and hatred for himself onto that poor little boy

1098,"Pineapples are thought to have originated in South America and were first discovered by Europeans in 1492 on the island of Guadeloupe. However, pineapples didn't make it to England until the late 1600's, where it quickly became a must-have item for the wealthy. Worth around $8,000 (£5000) each, only the absolute elite could afford this exotic fruit, and according to one source, the fruit wasn't even eaten – just carried around under one's arm at parties and social events as a status symbol. If you've ever eaten a pineapple, you'll have experienced that weird, scratchy, rough feeling on your tongue after you've munched through a few chunks. So why does that happen? It turns out that pineapple contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest proteins. Despite bromelain being an approved anti-inflammatory treatment and having other health benefits, when it comes into contact with the sensitive skin in and around one's mouth, it's actually breaking down proteins, causing the tissue to become sore and inflamed. So your favorite fruit is essentially eating your mouth. Yes, we're being dramatic. But you get the point.","contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes that digest proteins"
1103,"There's a moment in Big Little Lies that I can't get out of my head. In the third episode of the mini-series, Laura Dern's character, Renata Klein, is talking with her husband about their daughter's challenges at school. When her husband tries to make a joke to  lighten the mood, she tells him, Just let me be a scared mom. Given the fascinating way the show covers women's relationships with their partners, other women, work, sexuality and more, it felt surprising and significant that that's the line I kept coming back to, even after the series' conclusion. It's because so often clients are coming to me with their fears. They'll say, I'm scared they'll give the job to someone else if I negotiate, I'm scared if I take on this new project, I'll fail, or I'm scared that if I go after a promotion and don't get it, I won't be happy in my current role. They tell me they're scared about something fairly often, but rarely are they comfortable with feeling that emotion. They often interpret fear as a sign they shouldn't take action. They may be coming to me with the hope that I'll have some magical life hack to override their fear response and make it go away. What was so compelling about Klein's request was that she was owning her fear.  She was willing to name it, I'm scared, and ask for support to stay with that feeling. Let me be scared. Fear is an emotion that can be hard to sit with, one we're taught to avoid. We think it indicates something is bad or wrong and that we should flee whatever it is that makes us afraid. Fear of physical harm, for example, is an important self preservation instinct. On the other hand, fear also commonly surfaces when we're stretching into a new space professionally. If we feel scared, it can be difficult to differentiate between fear that indicates danger and fear that's healthy and a sign of growth. When clients are struggling with fears about advocating for themselves, the very best thing I've found to do is to listen, ask questions, and hold space for them  to support them in talking through it. Letting them address their fears and get more comfortable with being scared allows them to go into the negotiation set up for success. The data bears this out. One study demonstrated that increasing women's feelings of control over the negotiation process improved the outcomes of their negotiations. A key aspect of this was helping women identify and strategize about how to overcome anxiety producing situations. In English, this means that knowing what scares you and naming it can help you advocate for yourself. Want to ace your next negotiation? Make space beforehand to feel your feelings. There's more evidence that accepting fear as a healthy emotion works. I recently presented at a conference with Kathryn Childers, one of the first female United States Secret Service Agents. Through rich anecdotes about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and the Queen of Spain, Childers described her experiences protecting the first family and foreign heads of state. When she talked about her success in the service, Childers said it wasn't that she wasn't scared  it's that she just did it anyway. It turns out that the very vulnerability and self awareness it takes to recognize that you're scared can actually make you even stronger and more effective. Central to Klein's identity is that she's both a working mom and a successful company CEO. While she makes some questionable choices, her approach to fear in this scene is a very healthy one. As I crave more of her backstory, I'd like to believe that part of her professional success stems from her willingness to name and sit with her fears.",accepting fear as a healthy emotion
1105,"Remember the days when memory foam was all the rage? There was that infomercial where the wine glass didn’t topple over while someone in mom jeans jumped on the other side? Well, we’re way past that. But for those who want a mattress like no other, there’s Hästens’ new Vividus bed (photo, above). Each custom-built bed takes 320 hours of hand-craftsmanship to make and will set you back anywhere from $140,000 to $200,000, depending on what size you choose. (Yes, American dollars! No, the bed does not fly!) Rest assured ― this is a quality mattress. Only ""selected craftsman are permitted to work on Vividus [beds], each specializing in their field,"" according to Hästens. And for the record, a redwood bed frame is included. But at the end of the day, does custom stitching really help you catch more sleep? What about breathable latex? ""Maybe yes,"" Terry Cralle, a certified clinical sleep educator and author of Sleeping Your Way To The Top, told The Huffington Post. A more expensive mattress might improve your sleep, but ultimately only if it makes you more comfortable, she explained. ""Price is not paramount, comfort is."" And comfort is incredibly individualized, she said. ""The mattress I love will be the mattress you hate. It’s that personal."" Studies in ergonomics and sleep medicine arrive at the same conclusion: your mattress is an important factor that either contributes to or harms the quality of your sleep. But there’s no one answer (or mattress) for everybody. And there’s no science to say spending more actually helps you get a better night’s sleep. So how should you figure out what bed’s right for you? Step 1: Find your perfect firmness One study that compared individual’s sleep quality on mattresses of varying firmness with the quality of sleep on their own mattresses showed sleep preference really did depend on the individual. The study included only nine men, but reported each man’s sleep quality on their own mattress, as well as on firm and soft mattresses. Four men slept better on the softer mattresses, two slept better on the hard mattress and the other three men showed no significant difference in their quality of sleep on either mattress. There is no standard answer about which sleeping surface is best. The differences in sleep quality on the various nights when the men slept on the different beds were significant, but depended on individual preference, one of the study’s authors Gaby Badre, associate professor and sleep researcher at University of Gothenburg in Sweden, told HuffPost. ""There is no standard answer about which sleeping surface is best,"" he said. Your bed should allow you to move easily during the night to adjust your sleep position without waking you up, he explained. Too soft a mattress will require more energy to move, but too firm a mattress could put unnecessary pressure on joints, nerves or blood vessels, he said. Someone who is lean might be able to easily make nighttime adjustments on a soft mattress, while someone who is overweight might end up ""sinking"" into the bed and struggle to find a comfortable sleeping position. Step 2: Find your ‘lying comfort’ It’s also important to remember that ""lying comfort"" is not the same as ""sleep comfort,"" Badre explained. Testing a bed lying down for a few minutes in a mattress store is not necessarily representative of whether you’ll be comfortable sleeping on it. And a lot of people forget that sleep changes throughout your life, depending on things like hormonal changes (like those from before to after menopause), musculoskeletal changes and for other reasons, he said. Most mattresses have a lifespan of about eight years, according to the National Sleep Foundation ― though that timeframe depends on the mattress and individual wear, too. Step 3: Don’t be impressed with a luxury price tag Cralle suggested that when it comes to buying a mattress, the bottom line should not be so much about price, as about taking the time to find a mattress that’s the best fit for you. ""A great mattress is a game-changer,"" she said. ""You are probably less likely to toss and turn all night ― thereby getting more deep, quality and restorative sleep and wake up feeling so much better if the mattress is the right fit for you."" And remember that the customer has the right to know what is in his or her mattress, Cralle said. ""Foams, flame retardants, textiles and any materials in the mattress should be divulged."" The bottom line for bed buying: DON’T spend so much time sweating the price. DO take the time to know what you’re buying and test it out.",And there’s no science to say spending more actually helps you get a better night’s sleep.
1109,"Most of us have that one friend...you know, the friend who runs multiple Tough Mudder races and can’t stop talking about it. Personally, you probably think they’re a little crazy to willingly subject themselves to electric shocks, ice baths, and mud along a ten to twelve-mile course. So what makes them do it? We asked participants, a sports psychologist, and a neuroscientist to weigh in. ""Events such as Tough Mudder do an excellent job at capturing the brain’s thirst for novelty,"" says sports psychologist Dr. Michael Gervais. As director of the DISC’s High Performance Psychology department, he’s helped elite athletes work through mental obstacles. ""Competition is the central driver for those who are attracted to environments that test one’s skills."" Is there something in the actual composition of the brain that influences people to participate? Dr. Barry O’Neill, cognitive neuroscientist and Cognitive Lead for the GSK Human Performance Lab, says no. ""I don’t think the composition of the brain per se is what drives people to take part. I think it’s what activities like Tough Mudder do to the brain that makes people come back for more and share those experiences. The biological changes generated by the activity, such as increased blood flow and neurochemical changes, make the activity rewarding and reinforce participation,"" he says. ""In other words, the ‘runner’s high,’ or in this case, the ‘running, jumping, climbing, and rolling around in the mud high.’"" Blogger and speaker Roni Noone has experienced that drive to come back for more. She’s completed seven Tough Mudders. ""For me they are confidence boosters,"" she says. ""Before every obstacle I think, ‘I can’t do this!’ and then I do! Or at the very least I try and fail and feel good that I gave it my best shot. I keep doing them because they are fun and different and challenge me like nothing else ever has."" According to Dr. O’Neill, the experience of the race influences brain processes, creating the positive feelings participants associate with the race (and keep trying to share with you). ""Tough Mudder is a stressful event that elicits a short term ‘fight or flight’ response,"" says Dr. O’Neill. ""This response starts in the brain with the activation of the amygdala, which starts a cascade of events that play a role in completing the event: increased adrenaline, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, increased oxygenation and blood flow to the muscles and brain, changes in neurotransmitters, and shutting down non-essential processes like digestion."" Camaraderie also makes an impression on the brain. ""One of the time-tested traditions of bonding is the shared experience of doing difficult things together,"" says Dr. Gervais. ""The obvious need for reliance on one another during the event facilitates bonding, and the storytelling after the event continues to strengthen the shared experience. Likewise, if the challenge of the event primed the footing for a shared ‘flow’ experience, each person would experience a swell of neurochemistry that produces a complete aliveness. The brain releases a cascade of dopamine, norepinephrine, anandamide, serotonin, and endorphins. When more than one person has this shared neurochemistry experience, bonding is facilitated at a level that even words have difficulty capturing."" Leadership coach Anthony Swede experienced this camaraderie during his first race this fall. ""It reminds me a little of the biker world. When guys on Harleys see each other, they wave. For Tough Mudder racers, it’s the same feeling,"" he says. ""I ran cross country, so I’m used to running long distances, but with this you were beat up pretty bad, and for some of the obstacles, there was no way you could accomplish them by yourself. There were people to pull you up or push you through, even if you’d never met them. There’s no way you can get through it without help."" ""You don’t run a Tough Mudder alone,"" says Roni. ""You run it with everyone on that course. I’ve helped and been helped by complete strangers. There’s a wonderful atmosphere of ‘we’re all in this together’ that’s very unique to Tough Mudders."" Ultimately, Tough Mudders offer participants the opportunity to test themselves not only physically, but mentally as well. ""You go through a lot of challenges that show how well you lead yourself. Leadership is influence in a specific direction. When I jumped into the ice bucket and climbed out, I was freezing cold and wanted to fall over, and had to think about how I would influence myself to take that next step,"" says Anthony. ""The endurance and mental toughness gives that great feeling that I accomplished something I never thought I’d be able to do. The overall experience of a Tough Mudder race is something I feel that everyone should do at some point."" Really to take the plunge? Find a race near you.","The biological changes generated by the activity, such as increased blood flow and neurochemical changes, make the activity rewarding and reinforce participation,"""

The second season of iZombie built to a big final battle sequence where energy drink company Max Rager (pun 2!) was purchased by Fillmore Graves Enterprises (pun 3!), and then a full-scale zombie outbreak took place. But according to creators Rob Thomas and Diane Ruggiero-Wright at the show’s Comic-Con panel, the upcoming third season will break that cycle. At the end of season two, Liv Moore (Rose McIver) discovered that there are many more zombies out in the world, and they’re preparing for an all-out war against humanity. The upcoming third season will be about Liv choosing a side: humans or zombies. She decides to start the post-zombie rampage period of her life by laying all cards on the table with her friends; how they react, Thomas and Ruggiero-Wright said, will form the crux of the season’s conflict. Other things we learned from the panel: • Blaine’s (David Anders) cold, abusive dad Angus DeBeers (Robert Knepper)—last seen being tortured with Les Misérables before an extended absence—will make a not-so-triumphant return as a frozen corpse in the basement of Blaine’s funeral home. • Peyton (Aly Michalka) will now be a series regular.

Thomas says Boss might return later in the season, but he’s not part of the first arc. • The writers gave McIver a list of close to 30 ideas of brains for Liv to eat during the upcoming season, with the stipulation that she was only allowed to veto one of the acquired side-effect skills. And yet, she noted, nobody mentioned to her that she’d be consuming a dominatrix brain. (That one drew a few whoops from the audience.) • At some point, we’ll meet the woman at the CDC who fired Ravi—when she walks into the Seattle PD to ask for help with a case. • Thomas and Ruggiero-Wright have assured McIver that unlike Liv’s last two paramours—Lowell in the first season, Drake in the second—the next time she has a love interest, he won’t get killed off.",The upcoming third season will be about Liv choosing a side: humans or zombies.
1113,"Getty There’s more than a handful of conspiracy theories out there about whether or not the U.S. government had anything to do with 9/11, but these new claims that Vladimir Putin may have solid evidence could actually prove the speculation to be true. Theorists are claiming that the Russian president has collected a substantial amount of evidence which proves the U.S. government and intelligence services were involved in plotting the atrocity that killed nearly 3,000 people and injured 6,000 more on September 11, 2001. Terrorist group al-Qaeda have been officially held responsible for crashing a plane into the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers, but truth seekers believe then-president George W. Bush’s administration was behind the attack, claiming Osama Bin Laden and his men were just a front. Getty There is no concrete evidence to suggest the U.S. government had any involvement – despite theorists’ claims the towers collapsed because of a controlled explosion. But Russian political website Pravda reported Putin is getting ready to release ‘authoritative evidence’ which proves ‘beyond any doubt’ that the American government was directly involved with 9/11. Getty The report reads: Putin is going to hit once, but he’s going to hit hard. Russia is preparing the release of evidence of the involvement of the US government and intelligence services in the September 11 attacks. The list of evidence includes satellite images. Published material can prove the US government complicity in the 9/11 attacks and the successful manipulation of public opinion. The attack was planned by the US government, but exercised using her proxy, so that an attack on America and the people of the United States looked like an act of aggression by international terrorist organisations. The article goes on to claim Putin’s alleged motive is to ‘expose the U.S. government’s secret terrorist policies’, the Daily Star reports. Getty However, skeptics have raised concerns over the authenticity of the report as Pravda is associated with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Putin has even said on record that he thinks an inside job would have been impossible, according to reports. But these theorists are convinced Russia has been saving the evidence as political ammunition. If it is true, it would be extremely worrying but we’re not exactly convinced, to be honest.","Theorists are claiming that the Russian president has collected a substantial amount of evidence which proves the U.S. government and intelligence services were involved in plotting the atrocity that killed nearly 3,000 people and injured 6,000 more on September 11, 2001"
1114,"The gulf in American politics between the left and the right can seem insurmountable. There are red states and blue states, liberal media sources and conservative media sources, even jobs and names that differ by political party. Research has suggested that liberals and conservatives even wash with different shampoos and soaps and thus have different smells. But actually, millions of Americans cross that gulf every day — by being married to someone of a different political party. In a new paper, two researchers examined American couples to see how common ""mixed"" political marriages really are. Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science at Yale University, and Yair Ghitza, a chief scientist at political data firm Catalist, studied a database of more than 18 million couples drawn from voter registration records. They found that most married couples — 70 percent of them — were made up of people of the same political affiliation (either Democratic, Republican or independent/other). Married couples overall were somewhat more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. But, as the graphic below shows, ""mixed"" political marriages certainly do happen. Three percent of married couples are female Republicans married to male Democrats (upper right rectangle), while 6 percent of married couples are male Republicans with female Democrats (lower left rectangle). So, overall, nearly 1 in 10 married couples contain both a Republican and a Democrat. Nineteen percent of married couples are a Republican or a Democrat with an independent. In total, nearly 30 percent of all married couples are of mixed party affiliation. Meanwhile, 30 percent of married couples were exclusively Republican, 25 percent of married couples were all Democrat, and 15 percent were all independent. Those findings might be surprising for people who are used to reading about America's divided politics, Hersh said. ""There’s actually a lot of people all mixed up together in terms of their politics,"" Hersh said. Hersh and Ghitza also compared political affiliation to other factors that often guide people’s choice of a marital partner — like age, race and geographical vicinity. Of course, all of these factors also have strong ties to a person’s political affiliation. First, they found that marrying across political parties is far more common in the United States than marrying across racial categories. (This is partly due to the way political and racial categories are split up — America is majority white but not majority Democratic or Republican). In the United States, 71 percent of couples are in same-party marriages, compared with 93 percent in same-race marriages. Their research also supported previous findings that Democrats live in more partisan neighborhoods than Republicans do — partly due to concentrated African American communities, where most people are Democrats. In neighborhoods that were more than 90 percent Democratic, they found that 68 percent of households were made up of two Democrats. But in neighborhoods that were more than 90 percent Republican, only 55 percent of households were made up of two Republicans. Also in line with prior research, they found that men are more likely to be Republican. The study shows that there are twice as many Democratic-Republican households in which the husband is a Republican than in which the wife is a Republican. [There’s a mathematical reason you’re less popular than your friends] They also found that older couples were much more likely to be of the same political party than younger couples are. Among married couples under 30, fewer than half were Democrat-Democrat or Republican-Republican pairs, the researchers say. But among couples over 80, 70 percent were. This is partly because more young people are independents. You can see those trends in the chart below, which shows how the household party registration of married couples changes by age. The bands in the middle get narrower as you go from the left to the right, showing that, as people get older, fewer are independents or in ""mixed"" political marriages. Instead, Democrat-Democrat and Republican-Republican couples become more common as people age. The researchers say this could be due to the effects of cohabitation — after years of living together, one spouse may be persuaded to join the other’s team. One of the paper’s main findings is about political turnout in elections. It appears that your spouse’s politics have a lot to do with your likelihood of getting out and voting on Election Day. Hersh says that effect was much larger than he expected. ""For two people who live in the same state, of the same age and race, if they’re living with someone of their own party they’re voting at much higher rates than if they’re living with someone of a different party."" But these trends vary depending on which specific parties you’re talking about. For both Republicans and Democrats, for example, being married to an independent tends to depress the person’s vote significantly more than being married to a person on the opposite side of the political spectrum. ""Being married to an independent, it brings down the turnout of the partisan, and it never brings up the turnout of the independent,"" he says. The graphic below shows the percentage drop in the likelihood of voting if one spouse has a different party registration from the other. In the 2012 primary, for example, a Democrat married to an independent or member of a third party was 13 percent less likely to vote than a Democrat married to another Democrat. As the graphic shows, being married to someone of a different party appeared to affect the vote of Republicans much more than Democrats, for unknown reasons. ""Depending on whether you’re a Democrat, or a Republican or an independent, the effects vary a lot,"" Hersh said. ""And they’re particularly strong for Republicans. A Republican married to a Democrat was 10 percentage points less likely to vote than a Republican married to a Republican. But a Democrat married to a Republican was only 3 percentage points less likely to vote than a Democrat married to a Democrat."" The paper is designed to explain what precisely is happening, not why it’s happening, so the researchers don’t know exactly why a spouse’s political party changes a person’s likelihood of voting. But they speculate that the reason could be twofold: that people who are less politically active are more likely to marry outside of their own party and that living together might influence a person’s politics and willingness to vote. Some people of different parties, for example, might have the feeling that their votes are ""canceling each other out"" and decide to stay at home on the sofa instead.

1116,"The birth of feminism in the late 1960s and early 1970s featured young women burning bras as a counterpoint to young men burning their draft cards. They were considered statements of feminine independence. Now there’s discussion regarding the medical merits of those demonstrations. The birth of feminism in the late 1960s and early 1970s featured young women burning bras as a counterpoint to young men burning their draft cards. They were considered statements of feminine independence. Now there’s discussion regarding the medical merits of those demonstrations. Controversial findings have been made that at least associate excessive bra wear to non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer. Some assert there is a definite link. Ironically, it was an American woman who invented the bra around the turn of the 20th Century. Up until the beginning of the 20th Century, corsets are what made women exhibit that desired hourglass figure and inadvertently pushed up the bust line for fashionable clothing of that time. Problem was, corsets messed with internal organs while shaping those hourglass figures, and their tightness resulted in women fainting easily and often. The Birth of the Bra In 1893, Marie Tucek made a ""breast supporter"" that looked like a modern brassiere. But a little later Mary Phelps Jacobs designed a better version and called it a brassiere. She patented it and sold the patent to a company named Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut for $1,500. It caught on. By the 1950s, teenage girls were urged to buy and use training bras to hold their breasts firmly in a desirable way and prevent sagging. But even the brassier industry admits that the only time bras prevent sagging is while wearing them. It’s been observed that using artificial breast support long enough will cause the breasts’ cup shaped suspensory Cooper’s ligaments to atrophy, allowing the breasts to sag over time anyway. Exercises that strengthen pectoral muscles can be helpful. It’s recommended to use a one piece sport bra for exercising. Some women use one piece sports bras as a healthier alternative for regular bras when not exercising. Bras and Breast Health Consequences The connection between wearing bras and painful and bothersome non-malignant breast fibrocystic disease as well as malignant breast cancer was hardly mentioned until the book Dressed to Kill by researchers Sydney Ross Singer and Soma Grismaijer came out in 1995. They surveyed 5,000 women and discovered that women who wore bras for 12 hours or more greatly increased breast cancer risk than women who wore bras less. Dr. Gregory Heigh of Florida has discovered that over 90% of women with fibrocystic breast disease find improvement when they stop wearing their brassieres. There are case testimonies (source below) from breast fibrocystic disorders who realized this when they stopped or at less lessened brassiere use. The connection between breast tumors, non-malignant or malignant and bras has merit when considering the lymph drainage issues from wearing bras too often. The lymph system, which includes lymph nodes in the breasts, requires body movement to pump out the lymph nodes accumulation of toxic waste materials. That’s what bouncing on a rebounder is about. Not only are breasts’ movements inhibited by bras to not allowing proper lymph nodes draining, but the actually tight enclosures of bras constricts the breasts and restricts lymph material flow. There was a study that attempted to debunk the link of excess bra wearing to breast fibrocystic disease and breast cancer, but that study itself was debunked in an There was a study that attempted to debunk the link of excess bra wearing to breast fibrocystic disease and breast cancer, but that study itself was debunked in an earlier RealFarmacy article. If a Florida doctor has observed 90 percent healing from fibrocystic breast disorders upon not wearing bras or wearing them less, and many other women have written in with positive results on their bra abstinence, it follows that wearing bras less or not at all helps prevent breast cancer.

1117,"When we heard the news that Rogue was releasing Sriracha Hot Stout Beer, we were intrigued. We promptly ordered a six-pack to find out how this bizarre flavor combination would taste. Being a fan of both Huy Fong's staple hot sauce—and well, all beer—I was eager to crack one. My initial thoughts? The bottle features an absolutely perfect version of the iconic sriracha rooster label, updated with Rogue's language. Get a bottle for your hot-sauce-loving friends, and they'll decorate their cubicles or man caves with it. Taste-wise, it's definitely drinkable. It's a rich stout with a tiny kick that hits you after the aftertaste. Would I order one in a bar? Um, if I saw ""Sriracha Beer"" on a menu anywhere, I'd order one in a heartbeat. Would I order a second one? Probably not. A session beer it is not. But it's a reasonable guess that Rogue doesn't think so either, given that the drink is only sold in single 750 ml bottles. But don't just take my word for it—we invited some members of the Adweek team to taste test this spicy beer in the video above.",It's a rich stout with a tiny kick that hits you after the aftertaste

With his hair almost down to his eye balls and a watch that may have been purchased at a department store (no shade), the look was understandable for a young star but not exactly wow-worthy. Fast-forward to today and the Biebs has evolved in more ways than one with his red carpet style. For starters, the hair is bleached blond and much shorter leaving his signature hair flip a little harder to accomplish.

A source revealed that a priest recited prayers but by mistakenly called him Sanjay Kumar instead of ! LOL! But, Akshay took it in good humour. The source further added that the priest apologised to Khiladi Kumar again, but in fact, the actor couldn't thank the priest enough for his special gesture. The community even presented Akshay with a pendant of Asho Farohar or Faravahar - one of the symbols of Zoroastrianism. That's sweet!","But, Akshay took it in good humour."
1126,"As a social and economic libertarian, I have little respect for the Heritage Foundation, for the same reason I don't respect any doctrinaire group playing fast and loose with facts. That is what I believe to be the root of fundamentalism -- the desire to force facts to fit theory, instead of modifying theories to fit facts. Heritage recently publicized the claims of ""100 scholars"" attacking marriage equality. Almost without exception, the ""scholars"" in question are deeply religious and put their faith ahead of facts. These are the people behind the claim that same-sex marriage increases abortion. According to them, same-sex marriage changes how heterosexuals act. Beyond causing 100 scholars to make total asses of themselves, I'm not sure there is anything to the theory. They claim same-sex marriage ""devalues"" marriage for heterosexuals. I assume by inflating the supply of marriage, they think each marriage is worth less. Why or how this devaluation takes place, and why heterosexuals are so irrational as to calculate the value of their own marriage on the basis of who else is married, is not explained. They make two leaps in their logic. The first is gay marriage devalues all marriage. Second, when you devalue marriage, and fewer women get married, they will have more abortions. Therefore, same-sex marriage will lead to more abortions. As Ayn Rand was known to say, ""Check your premises."" One problem is the total number of abortions in the United States has been declining, even as the number of married gay couples has increased. The Guttmacher Institute, which focuses on all the data on abortion, stated in 2014: ""The U.S. abortion rate declined to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2011, well below the 1981 peak of 29.3 per 1,000 and the lowest since 1973 (16.3 per 1,000), according to ""Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2011,"" by Rachel Jones and Jenna Jerman. Between 2008 and 2011, the abortion rate fell 13 percent, resuming the long-term downward trend that had stalled between 2005 and 2008. The number of abortions (1.1 million in 2011) also declined by 13 percent in this time period."" In the real word, as opposed to theory, we have had an increase in same-sex marriages, but a decrease in the number of abortions. For most people, that means the theory needs adjusting, but such is not the case for faith-based politics. In order to prove their case, at least in regards to the number of marriages in total, they point to specific incidents. For instance, they use a graph that supposedly shows a 36 percent plunge in marriage rates in Spain. They start the graph nine years before same-sex marriage was legalized and end it nine years after. I always wonder why ideologues pick specific starting points. I've seen people claim world famine is around the corner because grain production declined between point A and point B. They don't tell you A was a year with a big surplus of grain, causing plunging prices, thus causing farmers to cut back planting. The long term trend is more production, not less. Only picking points on the trend line that support one's theory is dishonest. What happens if you take the trend line for Spain and extended it further? Eurostat, which specializes in data for Europe, answers that question. Taking the data back to 1960 we can see a trend line longer than the highly selective one presented by Heritage. We see marriage rates were already in decline before same-sex marriage was legalized in 2005. I took the Eurostat data and made a trend line (below), using the data every 10th year until 2010 and then including the data for 2011 and 2012. It is clear that the lion's share of the decline preceded legalization of same-sex marriage. The examples of U.S. states given by Heritage always start just one year before same-sex marriage was legalized. Of course, one year is NOT sufficient for anyone to see what the trend line was BEFORE same-sex marriage was introduced. The claim they are making is not just that marriage rates have been declining, but that same-sex marriage is causing it to decline even faster. For that to be proven we need to see what happens to the trend line both before and after the introduction of same-sex marriage. They note that marriage rates in Massachusetts fell 8.9 percent since same-sex marriage was legalized in 2004. What was happening to marriage rates before 2004? According to the Census people, the 1990 marriage rate was 7.9. By 2000, before same-sex marriage was possible, the rate had fallen to 5.8, a decrease of about 26 percent. By only going back 9 years they gave the impression of more stability in marriage rates than actually existed. However, this decline is national. It isn't just happening in gay marriage states; it has been happening in all states and is the continuation of a trend starting long before the first gay couple married. For instance, using the Census data from 1990 to 2009 we see that marriage rates dropped just as dramatically, if not more so, in states that continue to reject marriage equality. In that time period marriage rates in Arkansas dropped 30 percent, in Ohio they were down 26 percent, in Tennessee they dropped a whopping 46 percent, in Mississippi they declined 30 percent, and were down 22 percent in Louisiana and 25 percent in Texas. Data on marriage rates in Europe show that from 1980 to 2012, marriage rates decreased whether a nation had same-sex marriage or not. This is true for U.S. states as well. Between 1990 and 2000 the average marriage rate per state declined from 9.8 per 1,000 people to 8.3. They declined whether or not gay couples could marry there. As even the most junior statistician would tell you: correlation is not causation. The decline in marriage rates began long before gay couples won the right to marry anywhere. To pin that decline on them is scapegoating, pure and simple, and I suspect, an act of desperation.","increase in same-sex marriages, but a decrease in the number of abortions"
1130,"Earth's place in the solar system is just right. It's not too hot, like Venus, and it's not too cold, like Mars, and this ""Goldilocks zone"" of habitability around other stars like the sun just might be bigger than thought, scientists say. A new study, unveiled today (Dec. 11), expands the habitable zone — the sweet spot in a solar system where liquid water and therefore life could potentially exist — surrounding stars like the sun. Previous studies on the habitability zone around sunlike stars have placed the innermost edge of so-called Goldilocks zone at about 0.99 AU (1 AU, or astronomical unit, is the average distance from Earth to the sun, about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers). But a new computer model study pushes that border closer to its parent star, to a distance of about 0.95 AU (about 88 million miles, or 142 million kilometers). [9 Exoplanets That Could Host Alien Life] The study in the journal Nature, led by Jeremy Leconte, now a postdoc at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics of the University of Toronto, used 3D computer modeling to find that the runaway greenhouse effect isn't an issue unless the planet is less than 0.95 AU from its star. The new inner boundary for habitable zones might not make a big difference for scientists trying to determine if an alien planet is habitable, but it does make a big difference for future life on Earth, Leconte said. At around 1 billion years in the future, the sun will cause Earth's oceans to boil from the runaway greenhouse effect. That temperature rise is depicted in this series of global maps. Eventually, the sun will become brighter, heating the Earth and potentially creating a runaway greenhouse effect — a feedback loop that eventually causes a planet's oceans to boil away. But that eventuality is long way off, and it may now actually be farther off than previously expected, Leconte suggests. ""For example, if we believe that the limit is at 0.99, it means that Earth would start losing oceans around 150 million years from now,"" Leconte told SPACE.com. ""Now, with our new estimate, it's not 150 million years, but it's actually 1 billion years, so almost an order of magnitude bigger."" Unlike previous one-dimensional studies, the new modeling takes clouds and circulation into account, jputting the inner edge of the habitable zone closer to a star. This buys Earth a little more time, although the planet is still quite close to the near end of the habitable zone. ""From the perspective of the Earth, this is a big change, and it's because the Earth is thought to be quite close to the inner edge,"" Leconte, who conducted this research while at the Intitut Pierre- Simon Laplace in Paris, said. ""We now find that it's not that close. It's still very close into the habitable zone compared to what could be other planets we see out there."" Leconte did use climate data collected for Earth science in the model, but he took out some of the more specific information to create a general model for rocky planets circling sunlike stars. Alien planets The new model could help scientists more fully understand what constitutes a habitable alien planet as well. ""We now have the real framework for understanding these objects not as just dots but as real planets that have a surface, an atmosphere where complex processes like cloud formation can happen like on the Earth,"" Leconte said. ""In a way we see them more as worlds than just as planets."" [7 Ways to Discover Alien Planets] Although the size of the habitable zone calculated by Leconte is larger than other estimates in the past, it is also much smaller than more recent estimates used to analyze data from the alien- planet-hunting Kepler space telescope. Earlier this year, scientists using the Kepler data estimated that 22 percent of sunlike stars may harbor a rocky planet in their habitable zones, however, the research team used a broad definition for the habitable zone, marking the inner edge at 0.5 AU, James Kasting, a professor of geosciences at the University of Pennsylvania, said. ""If you take the Petigura analysis [Kepler-based study] at face value, their number might be too high by a factor of two,"" Kasting, who wrote a News & Views piece about Leconte's study in this week's Nature, told SPACE.com. Oceans on Venus? Leconte's new work does help constrain the habitable zone around sunlike stars, but it could also have a bearing on the Goldilocks zones around other, dimmer stars. Scientists hope to use 3D modeling in the future to understand how a rocky planet around a dim star could fare as well. By applying the cutting-edge form of modeling to Venus during the earlier days of the solar system, scientists may catch a glimpse of what a rocky planet around a dim star could be like. When the sun was younger, it was also smaller and dimmer, therefore it's possible that Venus harbored liquid oceans that evaporated as the sun aged and grew brighter. Leconte has done some initial modeling to investigate these ideas, however, he hasn't found anything conclusive yet.","pushes that border closer to its parent star, to a distance of about 0.95 AU"
1132,"The U.S. Postal Service is issuing a new limited edition ""Forever"" stamp honoring Maya Angelou with a quote attributed to her: ""A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song."" But there is one small problem: The quote actually originated not with the late poet and civil rights champion but with a children' book author. ""Yes, that's my quote,"" author Joan Walsh Anglund told the Washington Post on Monday night. According to the Post, the quote is taken from Anglund's 1967 book of poems ""A Cup of Sun."" The only difference is the pronouns are changed from ""he"" in Anglund's poem to ""it"" on the stamp. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders told the Post that he was unaware of the Anglund quote, pointing out that ""numerous references"" attributed the quote to Angelou. Indeed, President Obama attributed the same quote to Angelou during the presentation of the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. ""The Postal Service used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography, 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'"" Saunders said in a statement. After being informed of the quote's origins, Saunders told the Post that the Postal Service ""would have used one of [Angelou's] many other works. . . . The sentence held great meaning for her and she is publicly identified with its popularity."" Angelou rose from poverty, segregation and violence to become a force on stage, screen and the printed page. She died last May at her Winston-Salem, North Carolina, home at 86. The stamp for dedication at a Washington ceremony Tuesday showcases Atlanta artist Ross Rossin's 2013 portrait of Angelou, an oil painting in the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery collection The postal service says Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, Maryland, designed the stamp based on Rossin's portrait.

Naturally, Pitt’s looks and charisma helped earn him the part, but as it turns out, he edged future bestie George Clooney for the role. Geena Davis , who played Thelma in Sir Ridley’s classic, recalled that she learned this fact while sitting opposite Clooney on a flight. As she recalls:Only, according to Geena Davis , she had no recollection of reading with George Clooney for the part! She was so enamored with Brad Pitt – who, to be fair, looks like a god constructed from perfect clay – that she hardly noticed Clooney, and didn’t recall meeting him until that day on the airplane, years later. Davis tells the whole story on, and it’s really worth a listen:Now, when Thelma & Louise would have been casting (in 1989 or ’90), George Clooney was a TV actor whose ""greatest"" cinematic credit was playing Matt Stevens in. He’d appeared on, and was starting to make a name for himself playing Roseanne Barr’s supervisor, Booker, on the sitcomBut he hadn’t yet become ""George Clooney, International Superstar,"" and it probably cost him a significant role.

1137,"Original Cheerios, one of America's favorite breakfast cereals, will now be GMO-free. In a major move, General Mills posted on its website today that original Cheerios are no longer made with genetically modified ingredients. The company explains that the oats used in Cheerios were never genetically modified, but that the corn starch is now non-GMO: It’s the unique and simple nature of original Cheerios that made this possible – and even that required significant investment over nearly a year. Cheerios’ principal ingredient has always been whole grain oats, and there are no GMO oats. We use just a small amount of corn starch in cooking, and just one gram of sugar per serving for taste. So we were able to change how we source and handle ingredients to ensure that the corn starch for original Cheerios comes only from non-GMO corn, and our sugar is only non-GMO pure cane sugar. General Mills will not be making other varieties of Cheerios GMO-free. ""For our other cereals, the widespread use of GM seed in crops such as corn, soy, or beet sugar would make reliably moving to non-GM ingredients difficult, if not impossible,"" the website says. A Cheerios spokesperson confirmed this decision to The Huffington Post. In November 2012, a group called Inside GMO launched a campaign to get Cheerios to become GMO-free. The campaign moved thousands to express their discontent over GMO ingredients in the cereal on Cheerios' Facebook page. Inside GMO released a video condemning GMOs in Cheerios, and over 25,000 people emailed and called General Mills in response. Watch the video here: Considering General Mills has spent millions of dollars to combat labeling GMOs, the move is somewhat unexpected. In 2012, the company paid $1.1 million dollars to fight Proposition 37 in California, which called for mandatory labeling of genetically modified food. The company clarified its stance on labeling on its website, however. It is behind a ""national solution"" for GMO-labeling, but against state-by-state legislation. Last year was a contentious one for GMOs. A high profile ballot measure to require GMO labeling was rejected in Washington state. Connecticut and Maine made major strides toward labeling laws. And Whole Foods announced it would be phasing out GMO food that wasn't labeled -- and dropping Chobani as a result. Green America Corporate Responsibility Director Todd Larsen highlighted what General Mills' decision means in a press release.

The most popular app to hit the States, Pokémon Go has made quite an impact on anyone who has a smartphone. The phenomenon that is Pokémon Go will not be slowing down any time soon. With word of Even if you don’t play it, you damn well have heard of it by now. The most popular app to hit the States,has made quite an impact on anyone who has a smartphone. The phenomenon that iswill not be slowing down any time soon. With word of an update that will include battling your friends along with making trades, the app will continue to evolve just like your Pokémon. With more news surfacing daily, it shouldn’t be a surprise to find that someone has already caught every Pokémon possible. A man named Nick Johnson from Brooklyn, New York had been playing Pokémon Go over the span of just a couple weeks and has since claimed that he has caught every pocket monster possible (in North America, that is). Below you’ll find a partial screenshot of his Pokédex: How Many Pokémon Has Johnson Caught? Out of the 147 Pokémon, Johnson claims he has found all 142 pocket monsters that are available in the United States. As of right now, there are only four Pokémon that are region-specific. They are Mr. Mime (Europe), Farfetch’d (Asia), Kangaskhan (Australia), and Tauros (North America). However according to some trainers, it’s quite possible to collect these Pokémon by hatching some eggs. What Was Nick’s Secret To Catching These Pokémon So Quickly? According to According to CNN , Johnson caught 135 Pokémon in only the first week and half of playing. However, it only took him roughly two weeks to catch all available Pokémon. One of his bigger secrets isn’t even a secret at all. Johnson stated that he talked to A LOT of players who would help him find some of the more difficult Pokémon found in only certain areas. Johnson had this to say about everyone who assisted him with his captures: ""I probably wouldn’t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn’t got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City."" That, my friends, is an incredible feat, even if he’s been given some help by fellow players. Regardless, it takes a lot of time and effort to hunt down even the rarest of Pokémon. The final capture happened the night of July 21st where he found his last remaining Pokémon in Central Park. Dratini Johnson mentioned how he received a lot of support from the fans also searching for Pokémon that night: ""Everyone kind of let out a little cheer and it was kind of a fun moment."" Johnson also stated how much time and effort he put into playing the game. The man who currently works at a platform innovation company called Applico would get off work at 6pm during the week and immediately search for Pokémon shortly after dinner. He and his girlfriend would trek through all of Manhattan to become the ultimate Pokémon master. Johnson said he received a lot of support from his girlfriend because she also is a huge Pokémon fanatic: ""She was very supportive through all this."" Johnson would spend upwards of 50 hrs per week trying to catch em’ all. He also said that his phone would clock him around 8 miles per day of trying to catch all of the Pokémon. He would also stay out very late, sometimes until 5 a.m., logging somewhere between 6 to 10 hrs a night — though all of that walking didn’t come without its share of challenges. What Was The Craziest Thing Johnson Did To Catch A Pokémon? When posed this question from a reporter, Johnson mentioned how he had ordered an Uber driver to take him around town because the radar from the game had been down. His effort allowed him to track down a Porygon: ""I had the driver drive me around for a little bit until I found it. Luckily it didn’t take me too long, so it wasn’t too big of an Uber bill."" Porygon Johnson continued to say how this choice motivated him to eventually find the remaining Pokémon: ""That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one. I was close to the end so it was extra motivation."" What’s Next For Johnson? A free trip around the world to hunt Pokémon? Johnson is living the dream. Well, after having found all accessible Pokémon in the U.S., Marriott Rewards has decided to sponsor him to find the remaining Pokémon that are only located on other continents. A Marriott spokesperson has confirmed this to be indeed true, stating, ""Marriott Rewards will be helping Nick on his international journey to catch the last remaining Pokémon."" I can’t say I’m not jealous that he’s receiving a paid trip around the world just to find fictional creatures. No other information has been disclosed to the public as of right now. It’ll be interesting to see where Johnson will find these few remaining Pokémon. In the meantime, we should all strive to do our very best to catch as many as we can. Johnson’s childhood dream has certainly become a reality: ""My childhood dreams of being a Pokémon master have come true.""",Marriott Rewards has decided to sponsor him to find the remaining Pokémon that are only located on other continents

The Facebook group continues to generate memes for Bernie supporters that transcend the traditional media coverage of their beloved Presidential candidate. The memes are explanatory, deconstructive, self-aware, and incendiary. Bernie Sanders meme producers are creating content that resonates beyond the deepest niches of Reddit. This fuels the intrigue and growing popularity of the dank stash. Some of the memes are so high-level that they deserve the label 'dank af.' When you join the Facebook group, memes in support of Bernie Sanders will bombard your feed. Bernie will become the center of your universe. If you've already fallen in love with his plans to break up the big banks and bring back democracy, then you will love these high-level memes that weave Bernie into today's cultural fabric. Every dank meme is a love letter to Bernie Sanders, and his image is the presence we need to make sense of the digital chaos of today. Now that was a dank meme. Sure, this video is incredibly dank. It's quite a high-level meme made by an internet prosumer. The question is: Does dankness translate to electability? Sure, as a self-identifying progressive (and progressive internet user), I can speak the language of the dank meme. But when it comes to non-Millennial demographics (who can be counted on to vote in primaries and general elections), perhaps the dankness of these memes could make Bernie Sanders seems unapproachable to those who prefer memes curated by their local radio station's Facebook page. The demand for so much commentary inside of one dank meme will only be interpreted as 'spectacle,' and the substance of the meme as a micro-art piece will not be fully appreciated. It feels like Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash is more of a safe haven for those who need reinforcement from non-Establishment media streams I am so intrigued by the content and community voice of Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash and will frequently load the Facebook group to maximize my consumption of Bernie news, letting the community-curated propaganda soothe my newly converted Democratic Socialist mind. Bernie's dank memes begin in the stash, and are shared to amuse or annoy outsiders. These memes can be subjected to the same backlash cycles of most internet content. Racism, sexism, ageism, and other discriminatory angles could easily be applied to the stash by a stash-outsider or dissenter. The Dank Meme Stash admins do their best to keep it positive. Everyone is welcome to enjoy the commentary on Bernie Sanders, much like you are welcome onboard Bernie's Revolution wagon. #BernieBros, the voice of male Sanders supporters who use hostile or sexist terms to cut down Hillary Clinton, are often banned or berated in the comments, and many memes don't get through the screening process of dankness. Any memes that are sexist, racist, or make a personal attack on Hillary Clinton will not be approved. The Dank Meme Stash must be a positive reflection on the campaign of Bernie Sanders. The challenges of Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash mirror those of any internet community. As the community grows, there is a demand for more content. More memes come, but quality can suffer. More 'trolls' can come to 'hate' in the comments. More time must be spent policing threads that get out of hand. There are more critics lamenting the quality of the content and direction of community, while many ""original members""—people who were on board before polls indicated that Bernie was a viable Presidential candidate—can lament the good ol' days when the community was much more authentically dank. The definition of dankness is somewhat fluid. Urban Dictionary defines it as ""an expression used by stoners and hippies for something of high quality,"" but it's not very dank to use Urban Dictionary as a method of comprehending youth culture terms. Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash has brought 'dank' to the forefront of positive buzzwords, challenging words like 'cool' and 'chill.' Dank is something that is so positive that it is undefinable. It is also likely to include weed, television, movie, and fast-casual dining option jokes. Dank memes acknowledge our immersion in the digital economy of culture. Memes are the communicative medium. Dankness is the genuine spirit of the content, leaping off the screen and crawling into your soul. Bernie Sanders has been touted as the internet's candidate, but it's still hard to tell if the internet a place where contemporary 'grassroots' movements happen any more. There are two simultaneous conservative and liberal internets happening concurrently anyways. Sure, dank memes show that a segment of the base is 'charged up.' But is that truly converting supporters? It feels like Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash is more of a safe haven for those who need reinforcement from non-Establishment media streams to believe that Bernie Sanders' candidacy is truly viable. Proof beyond the latest angle from a statistical content farm or piece from an economic theorist who may or may not be right about Sanders' proposed plans. Dank memeing isn't always easy, even for the dankest of meme makers. After narrow losses in Nevada and Iowa, it's easy to wonder how exactly this trendworthy page can mobilize to do even more than 'create awareness' amongst those who were likely to identify with the candidate anyways. Tangible political action might not be an outcome of a dank meme stash. Self-aware, entertaining internet humor for a disenfranchised generation intrigued by a man who is explaining that societal and governmental forces may be screwing them over might be the only real outcome. This is the problem with 'niche' on the internet. It has a ceiling, and at a point can become an insular cycle. Broad appeal comes from marginalizing the message and reaching audiences that you never thought you could identify with. The community/website/Facebook group feels less dank, but if the goal is electing the next President of the United States, the message will continue to morph. As Bernie Sanders moves forward, earning every delegate he can in the slow march towards the Democratic party nomination, we will at the very least get to watch the community-generated meme play a bigger role in politics and media narratives. The Dank Meme Stash itself will become a deep well of content that outgrows the functionality of a Facebook group. It will be a wall of noise, with endless comment threads making it blend into the meaninglessness of most internet content. Without 24/7 curation, the group will not look like the stash of premium dank memes that it once did to those who just want to believe in Bernie Sanders. Any broadly appealing Presidential candidate will rely upon traditional methods like phone banking and block walking. Money will be spent on radio and television ads. There will not be a premium dank meme fund, beyond whoever curates a candidate's Twitter feed with glossy images and quotes. The forces that Bernie Sanders tells us he is fighting against will probably just control the democratic process anyways. And eventually, members of the Dank Meme Stash will have to decide if it is dank to actually physically participate in the political process instead of chilling hard in the digital malaise of a Facebook group.

1144,"Dustin Kennerley tried to quit smoking three times over the course of two years. The constant cravings and intense withdrawal symptoms made it impossible to get through the day without thinking about cigarettes, he said. ""I was very angry all the time, very edgy, very irritable about everything,"" said Kennerley, a linguistics student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ""I lasted about three days and went and bought a pack of cigarettes."" If, like Kennerley, you're having trouble kicking your cigarette habit, your brain might be to blame, according to new research on mice published in the journal Current Biology. Scientists at the Brudnick Neurophsyciatric Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have pinpointed specific areas in the brain that could be responsible for nicotine withdrawal symptoms like nausea, headaches, irritability and weight gain that make it so difficult to go cold turkey. About 69 percent of smokers say they want to quit smoking, but nicotine, the drug in tobacco products, may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. ""We’re trying to understand what chronic nicotine [use] does for the brain that makes it hard to quit,"" said Andrew Tapper, PhD, a neuroscientist at UMass and co-author of the new study. Kennerley is a case in point. ""I'd smoke one or two [cigarettes] and then throw them away and be mad at myself,"" he said. ""[Smoking], that's all I could think about. It's such a strong craving."" Why Is It so Tough to Quit? In an effort to understand nicotine addiction, Dr. Tapper's team gave mice nicotine-laden water for six weeks until their brains, much like human brains, were hooked on the chemical. Then they took the nicotine water away and watched as the mice went through their own version of withdrawals: excessive grooming, scratching, digging and shaking. The researchers looked at the mice brains and found activity within the interpeduncular nucleus, an area deep under the cortex in the middle of the brain. ""We found that when you get an animal dependent on nicotine and you take it away, this little brain region became overactive,"" said Tapper. The nicotine in cigarettes is a highly addictive chemical because when you smoke a cigarette, the nicotine travels to your brain and attaches itself to a nicotinic receptor. Those receptors then release a chemical called dopamine, which is also released after other fun things, like having sex or eating cupcakes. Dopamine makes you feel good, and your brain associates those good feelings with smoking. Quitting is challenging because the brain becomes accustomed to constant doses of nicotine. If you stop smoking, the drug leaves your system, and neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus trigger withdrawal symptoms — irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating and weight gain — that might prompt you to smoke again. ""Even though you tell yourself, 'No, no, no,' your brain will find a way to convince you [smoking] is a good idea,"" said Kennerley, who finally gave up cigarettes in 2009 after many attempts. ""It feels like your brain is tricking you. It will convince you against better judgment that [smoking] is what you want."" Smoking Addiction Kills When Tapper activated neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus region in mice who weren't addicted to nicotine, they, too, started exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. This suggests that there's a strong connection between the this area of the brain and the negative side effects of nicotine detox. If scientists could figure out how to placate these neurons and get rid of those withdrawal symptoms, more people might give up the habit, they theorize. ""[This research] is important for people who have a very hard time quitting,"" said John Dani, PhD, a neuroscientist and nicotine addiction expert at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ""I've seen people standing outside in their hospital gowns smoking a cigarette — they just can't quit."" Tobacco use costs the U.S. $97 billion in lost productivity, and contributes to 5 million deaths worldwide every year. Statistics show that smokers die more than 10 years earlier than non-smokers. ""Adverse health consequences of smoking make it the most preventable cause of mortality in the world, and that’s why we’re working on it,"" Tapper explained. Tapper's research is still preliminary and was conducted only in mice, but it seems to be a meaningful step forward that could provide targets for stop-smoking drug development, said Dr. Dani. ""This circuitry is working in a way that's helping to perpetuate [smoking]. The brain has been tricked into thinking [smoking] is valuable, and that's how addiction starts,"" Dani said. ""The better we understand how these circuits shape behavior, the more likely we are to be able to control them.""","specific areas in the brain that could be responsible for nicotine withdrawal symptoms like nausea, headaches, irritability and weight gain that make it so difficult to go cold turkey"
1146,"Even before their first acts of rebellion, teenagers can get a bad reputation. Popular myths paint the adolescent years as a time of hormone-fueled immaturity, while adults tend to look back on teenage-hood as a difficult time that young people simply need to ""survive."" Informed by the new findings of neuroscience, along with years of clinical practice working with adolescents, Dr. Daniel J. Siegel, MD, one of the premier minds behind brain research, behavior and addiction, argues that these misconceptions obscure what's really going on: important rewirings of the brain that prepare adolescents to strike out on their own, but also make them particularly vulnerable to certain risks, including drug abuse and addiction. His new book Brainstorm: The Power and Purpose of the Teenage Brain (Tarcher, 2014), aims to help both adolescents and adults understand the transformations of the teenage brain. In a telephone interview, he spoke to The Fix about adolescence, drug use and the dangers of addiction: The Fix: I wanted to start where the book starts, talking about some of the misconceptions and myths about adolescence. How do you think those misconceptions shape people's opinions of drug and alcohol abuse in adolescence? Daniel Siegel: The myths have made it so that our understanding of adolescence is misguided. We think of raging hormones, that adolescence is a period of immaturity. We think that some of the behaviors are just a function of impulsivity, when in fact there are other truths that are really more accurate. The first thing is that these myths disempower the adolescents, and really disempower the adults to have a deeper understanding of how adolescence is really a time not of immaturity but of [brain] remodeling. And part of what goes on with remodeling is getting the individual ready to leave home. And that's actually a really good thing. But there are parts that don't function quite as well, so that's part of the emotionality of this period — not that it's immaturity, but really that it's a remodeling. Part of what allows the adolescent to get ready to leave home is this remodeling that includes a change in the dopamine system. And the dopamine system — dopamine is a chemical, it's a neurotransmitter that's part of the system of reward in the brain. Dopamine levels at baseline are lower and the dopamine release amounts are higher [in adolescents]. What this helps explain is some of the boredom of adolescents and the drive toward doing things that secrete dopamine. One of the things that secretes dopamine that's a good thing is novelty, trying new things. And that can explain the risk-taking behavior. But this dopamine shift, unfortunately, makes it so that the adolescent is at risk of anything that could be addictive, because addiction involves the release and then the entrainment of the dopamine system. This explains the finding that if you're going to get addicted to something, it's most likely to happen during adolescence. TF: Given what you write about how dopamine is working in the adolescent brain, is it accurate to say then that someone who starts using drugs as an adolescent would be at risk for addiction, whereas maybe if that same person started later in life, they wouldn't face the same level of risk? DS: We're now learning that what happens in the brain is not just that the dopamine system is by itself getting entrained in these ways where, you know, you can get your dopamine release if you drink alcohol. But in addition, what we're just beginning to discover is that in each of our cells, especially relevant in the brain, are genes. And the genes are controlled by what are called epigenetic molecules. These are non-nucleic acid molecules [i.e., not DNA] that help regulate what's called gene expression. So, what we're beginning to understand is that early exposure to drugs of abuse may change the epigenetic control of areas that regulate emotion or regulate even dopamine release. This finding then shows us how if you have early exposure, you may in fact be more prone to being vulnerable later on, because you've changed the epigenetic molecules that regulate gene expression. That's what explains why some people may have what's called a drug of choice. While any of these drugs can lead to dopamine changes, certain drugs become a particular draw to particular people. The brain entrains itself to one particular kind of drug. That's really a new science. TF: In connection with addiction, it seems you're mostly talking about the dopamine system. But are there other changes happening in the brain during this period that are important when thinking about drugs and addiction? DS: I think for the addiction issue, the dopamine story is a really, really big one. Another one is what I call hyper-rational thinking, and this is where, it's not the reward circuit, but what are called the appraisal circuits that change. And these appraisal circuits, basically, are weighing the pros and cons of the decision. So this would be relevant for drug use in that you may have people who are making choices about things where it isn't in their best interest. The appraisal system, the upside is that it says, these are the exciting things going on, and this is why I want to do this, this will be really fun. It over-emphasizes the positive aspects of a choice, and it de-emphasizes the negative aspects of a choice. The overall result is you kind of rationalize it, and that's why I call it hyper-rational. TF: You talk about trying to reduce the risky behavior, and some of the examples you give are, if a kid has a ""need for speed,"" you might take them skateboarding. And with cigarettes, you mention, instead of saying, ""No, don't smoke,"" talk about how corporations are trying to influence you. I wondered if you could think of parallel techniques for alcohol and harder drugs? DS: I think, from the research point of view, what you might want to think about, in general, is that the work that looks at how people can focus on their inner life, what are called mindfulness practices. Those show that the more you can generate what I call internal education, the kind of internal sense of yourself, the likelier you are to be able to regulate, for example, your emotions and clarify your thinking. So, if you had to come up with a plan on how to support the development of the mind, you would want to do some mindfulness practices. It's a broad skill you develop. I call them mindset skills. You can learn to use your mind to change the way your brain regulates emotion, for example, and deals with anxiety and stress. These are learnable skills, and so what we want to do, and what I try to do in the book, is provide skill-training opportunities, these mindset skills sections of the book. You are learning literally the internal techniques of how to balance your emotions, and deal with upsetting memories, and deal with them well. TF: In your practice, dealing with adolescents, what's your sense of how real the risk of addiction seems to that age group? DS: What's so interesting is that the old view that adolescents aren't aware of danger looks like it's not so true. Adolescents know about the danger. But as we pointed out, in this hyper-rational thinking, they just evaluate their dangers with less import. They just don't care about them so much. And so it may be the same thing with addiction. They know it is a risk, but they just don't care. It's not even so much that [they think] they're invincible, but that they just consider the risk so unimportant, that it doesn't weigh on them at all. TF: You talk about how some parents will say, ""Don't use drugs and alcohol at all, that's off limits,"" and others say, ""Well, it's going to happen, so this is how you do it safely."" What do you think of the relative merits of those approaches? DS: It's a really, really important and difficult question. I think every family comes to their own sense of truth about it. Because I know some families want a zero-tolerance policy, some families want kids to experience drug and alcohol use when they're still at home, so they don't go wild when they go off to school. I don't think we have a research-based statement we can make that one way is better than another. So when I work with people, I really support them digging deep into their sense of how they would like to approach it, and explain their approach to their kids. I know people want me to give a definitive answer on that, but I don't think there is one based on the research. I wish there were, because it comes up all the time, and I wish I could tell people, ""This is the right answer."" TF: I wanted to give you the opportunity to share anything else of importance about adolescence and addiction we might have missed. DS: We have an opportunity to empower adolescents and adults to understand the truths about adolescence in a way that can really change the way we have this cultural conversation about this important period of time. So, looking at substance abuse is one window into that, and really empowering an adolescent to understand what's going on inside of them, their feelings, the way their mind is working, their relationships, I think can really support them in leading a more resilient and healthier life.","if you have early exposure, you may in fact be more prone to being vulnerable later on"
1147,"Pokémon GO is one of the biggest game crazes to come along in history. Go to your local downtown area and tell me you don’t see groups of people on their smartphones trying to find a rare. You can still come across a good amount of uncommons, rares and epics, but legendaries are a whole other story. This game contains all of the original 151 Pokémon, meaning that the legendaries are represented by Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. Read on for info on how to get the Legendary Pokémon in Pokémon GO! First, let’s run through all of the rumors that have been flying around the internet. Many people have reported seeing Moltres, especially. One person has reported seeing Articuno’s silhouette with three footsteps next to it so far. Nobody that I know of has reported seeing Zapdos or the Mew twins in the wild. The biggest Mew twins rumor out there centers around the idea that Mewtwo can be found in Times Square. This stems from an old trailer for Pokémon GO that was released which involved players gathering in Times Square, with Mewtwo spawning across all of their phones. They teamed up to face Mewtwo and then they all caught him. That was just for the trailer, though. Mewtwo has not been spawned in the wild yet and according to the developer Niantic, none of them have. That is because Niantic has to manually spawn the legendaries. The legendaries, unlike the common and even rare Pokémon that permeate the rest of the game, do not show up unless they are manually made to show up. So the way to get the legendaries is to wait for a special event to happen, and if Niantic’s prior game Ingress is any indication, there will be loads of special events, probably held monthly or whenever there is a new console Pokémon game released or to celebrate an anniversary of some kind. Bring along plenty of Great Balls, Ultra Balls and Master Balls with you when these special events. Niantic has previously, in the game Ingress, organized events where players fight to take control of a city, and a citywide event could certainly lead to earning the legendaries. In addition, players are organized into three teams with Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres as mascots, so a worldwide top-team competition or an intra-team competition to be the top trainer could be organized with those three birds as the rewards. Having extremely high combat power or CP will help. As for Ditto, it, like the legendaries, is in the source code of the game; however, Ditto has not been added to the game yet and is so far the only non-legendary Pokémon that not one single person has caught. Expect Ditto to be added to Pokémon GO with a future update to the game. When it is, we will be there with some tips and tricks on how to find Ditto.","So the way to get the legendaries is to wait for a special event to happen, and if Niantic’s prior game Ingress is any indication, there will be loads of special events, probably held monthly or whenever there is a new console Pokémon game released or to celebrate an anniversary of some kind."
1149,"Dennis Gaughan, whose wife, Maura, organized distribution of the rainbow flag, displayed the banner on Monday. NATICK – Cari and Lauri Ryding always felt welcome on Strawberry Hill Road. Then they came home from vacation and discovered the rainbow flag they had hung after the Orlando massacre had been stolen and their front porch pelted with eggs. ""It really sent us reeling,"" Cari said. But what happened next reminded the couple why they loved the neighborhood in the first place. On Sunday, a squadron of children on bicycles delivered rainbow flags to house after house. And one by one, the flags went up, transforming a swath of suburbia – more than 40 houses in all — into a brilliantly colored declaration of pride and solidarity, displayed on picket fences, garages, doorways, and decks. ""It just happened so quickly — the whole neighborhood said, ‘Get me a flag. Get me a flag. Get me a flag,’ "" said Penni Rochwerger, who lives around the corner from the Rydings. ""If we can stop whatever hate is out there, I think that’s really important."" Lauri Ryding said that after cleaning the eggs off her porch, she walked through the streets around her home, overwhelmed by all the neighbors prominently flying the rainbow colors. ""One person’s act of fear and maliciousness created such a powerful statement of love,"" she said. ""We are very blessed, very fortunate."" Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff Lauri (left) and Cari Ryding returned from vacation and discovered their rainbow flag stolen and their house egged. Cari Ryding, 49, first moved to Strawberry Hill Road 23 years ago, and, she said, she immediately fell in love with the family-friendly feel of the place. ""I loved the diversity of the generations, and how there’s a commitment to that — of all ages, and all shapes, and sizes, and preferences,"" she said. ""I’ve been feeling this energy in the neighborhood for years."" That feeling was reinforced, she said, after she separated from her husband 10 years ago, and her neighbors helped her adjust to life as a single parent, bringing her dinners if she was sick or watching two of her children if she had to take the third to the doctor. And the bond deepened even further, she said, when neighbors who had met her husband welcomed her wife, Lauri, 52. ""When I moved in four and a half years ago, I was embraced,"" Lauri said. ""Our relationship was embraced."" So both women were stunned when they came home Wednesday to discover the vandalism. ""It was our first experience in Natick of having any type of prejudice,"" Cari said. ""We hadn’t experienced it all, and it kind of broke open our little cocoon."" They alerted Natick police, and asked neighbors on Facebook if anyone knew what happened. No one did and still there are no suspects. But many were outraged. One neighbor suggested asking for a stack of flags from the Rainbow Peace Flag Project, a local organization that gives away the flags free to Natick-area residents. The Rydings had ordered their flag from the group about a month ago, to honor the 49 victims killed in June at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Immediately, requests flooded in, along with donations to the group. ""We said, ‘Why don’t we all have the flags? They can’t take them from all of us,’"" said Dennis Gaughan, whose wife, Maura, helped organize the rainbow response. Lois McGillivray, 85, who has lived on Strawberry Hill Road for 50 years, had one of the rainbow flags proudly displayed on her home on Monday. ""I have never met anyone who would do what that person did to that house,"" she said. ""This is a place where nobody bothers anybody, no matter how you want to live, as long as you’re not digging up the garden and throwing the dirt in my yard."" Neil Podolski said he wanted to fly a rainbow flag, as well, after hearing that the Rydings’ home had been vandalized. ""It’s just not right,"" said Podolski, who is Jewish. ""Who’s to say tomorrow we don’t find a swastika on our house?"" Cari Ryding said that she had started thinking twice about her neighborhood after her home was targeted, ""and what they did completely overshadowed that fear and we are just overwhelmed with the kindness and generosity."" As jarring as the initial crime was, Lauri Ryding said, the response has helped restore their faith in their community. ""Somebody’s fear called them to action,"" she said. ""But our neighbors support and love called them to action, and love conquers hate. Love wins. We win.""","On Sunday, a squadron of children on bicycles delivered rainbow flags to house after house.

1152,"The online retailer, Amazon, currently has 22 pop-up stores in malls across America. It now plans to expand its kiosk retail operations. In this 2015 photo, a forklift operator moves a pallet of goods at a Amazon.com fulfillment center in DuPont, Wash. The Commerce Department issues its July 2016 report on wholesale stockpiles on Friday, Sept. 9, 2016. The world’s largest online retailer could be bringing its wares to a mall near you, according to Business Insider, which reports that Amazon is planning to establish up to 100 pop-up stores across the country. The pop-up kiosks differ from Amazon’s online store and its existing brick-and-mortar shop in Seattle in that they are non-permanent stalls, intended to introduce potential customers to Amazon products rather than make sales. ""We offer pop-up kiosks so that customers can try out all our new devices and learn about our services like Prime and unique content like Amazon Originals,"" Amazon said in a statement. While the vast majority of its business is transacted online, Amazon has been expanding into the brick-and-mortar world recently. The company opened its first bookstore in Seattle last year, and has announced its intention to construct more stores in San Diego, New York, Chicago, and Portland. Currently, Amazon has 22 pop-up stores in 12 states , with that number potentially set to grow to up to 100 stores by next year. California is home to six of the existing stores, with Washington state, New Jersey, New York, and Texas each hosting more than two apiece. Unlike its online store, where customers can purchase anything from laundry detergent to a television set, pop-up stores are dedicated to showcasing Amazon’s electronic products (such as the Kindle Fire or the Echo) and marketing its services, such as Prime TV. The goal is to allow customers to interface with products in the 300- to 500-foot pop-ups, thereby increasing online Amazon sales. Ironically, as sales and services become more digitally driven, some online stores are shifting back to the physical realm. Customers like the hands-on experience and discussing features with an actual person. As The Christian Science Monitor’s Jason Thomson reported in May, many online stores are seeking to grow their physical presence ""Amazon spent the first 10 to 20 years convincing people to buy online,"" Georgetown University business professor Marlene Morris Towns told the Monitor. ""Now there is a shift, with lots of online sellers moving into physical spaces."" In February, mall operations chief Sandeep Mathrani told reporters that Amazon could hope to eventually open up to 400 brick-and-mortar stores, though he later stepped back from those claims. In May, CEO Jeff Bezos told investors that the online retailer was interested in aggressive expansion into retail. As Amazon deepens its investment in the technology and services markets, allowing customers to interface with new products has become increasingly important. One source told Business Insider that Amazon first considered establishing pop-up stores when it released the Echo, a hands free, voice-controlled speaker, in 2013. The Echo and its companion, Alexa, are some of the electronics featured at Amazon pop-up stores. Department stores, such as Wal-Mart, stopped selling Amazon electronics products in 2012. ""When you walk into a store, surrounded by everything the retailer represents – the staff, the layout, the products, the music – you get a sense of what this brand really is,"" Georgetown’s Dr. Towns told the Monitor. ""Despite the convenience and lower prices of online shopping, consumers still miss out on the 3D experience.""","The goal is to allow customers to interface with products in the 300- to 500-foot pop-ups, thereby increasing online Amazon sales."
1155,"Toxic chemicals used to fireproof sofas and mattresses have caused a surge in thyroid cancer, experts warn. Flame retardants are feared to be making families ill after being exposed to them through household dust. Although the chemicals have been widely restricted, experts warn the measures do not go far enough. It comes after the Government was repeatedly warned of the potential dangers of the chemicals by the civil servant for furniture fire safety policy. Terry Edge, who quit the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy last year after his proposals to restrict all flame retardants were rejected, said: ‘Flame retardants are causing thousands of cancers and other illnesses, with children particularly vulnerable.’  Thyroid cancer cases have leapt by 74 per cent in the last decade in Britain, with US researchers blaming the rising rates on flame retardants. After analysing household dust and taking blood samples from people with thyroid cancer, the scientists from Duke University found the patients had a high exposure to flame retardants called polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs).  These were banned in 2004 but are still in the homes of people with furniture bought before that time. The cancer patients also had higher levels of TCEP, a flame retardant banned 16 years ago.  Both chemicals are linked with cancer because they interfere with hormones.  DecaBDE, the most widely used of the PBDE chemicals, is not banned but highly restricted. Dr Heather Stapleton, whose work will be presented at the International Symposium on Fire Retardants in York, told the Sunday Times: ‘The chemicals are released as household dust and enter our bodies on our food and hands, with the highest levels in children.’ Brominated flame retardants are linked with learning problems, low sperm counts and difficulties in becoming pregnant.  They have been used in sofas, mattresses and carpets. A spokesman for the National Bed Federation said DecaBDE is set to be banned within two years. A Defra spokesman said: ‘We will continue to push for further controls.’",Toxic chemicals used to fireproof sofas and mattresses have caused a surge in thyroid cancer

1159,"Donald Trump’s support went from a niche group of unhappy voters to a majority of Republicans. Americans trust Trump on the economy, but would rather see Hillary Clinton in charge of foreign policy. And Brexit polls might be shifting toward ""remain in the European Union"" in the final days before Thursday’s referendum. This is HuffPollster for Monday, June 20, 2016. HOW TRUMP WENT FROM HERO OF THE DISAFFECTED TO NOMINEE - Benjy Sarlin: ""Today, a description of who supports Trump is simple enough: Republicans. In the final seven races before party leaders crowned Trump the presumptive nominee, he took every county save for six, while winning almost every demographic slice of GOP voters....[T]here are a lot of voters... who warmed to Trump gradually. In a March 2015 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, 74 percent of Republican voters said they could not imagine supporting Trump. The number was only marginally better, at 66 percent, when he launched his campaign that June. By April of 2016, however, the number had plummeted to 38 percent. By the time the primary race ended, Trump also drew close to 50 percent support from GOP primary voters in national polls. It wasn’t always that way: For almost all of 2015, he polled in the mid-20s, leading many Republicans to speculate that there was a ceiling to his support....The story of Trump, then, is about a committed minority of Republican voters, whose existence was routinely ignored, gradually taking over the entire party. As you’ll see in our data, the people who backed Trump early on – and the places they live – were markedly different than the unified GOP bloc he commands now."" [NBC] IN A DO-OVER OF THE GOP PRIMARY, TRUMP WOULD STILL WIN - HuffPollster: ""Plenty of Republican and Republican-leaning voters are less than thrilled with their presumptive nominee. While 44 percent consider him the best option out of this year’s pool of candidates, an equal 44 percent say he wasn’t the best choice, according to the survey, which was taken June 7-9. But just like the first time around, the opposition to Trump remains hopelessly divided. Asked who they would most like to see as the nominee if they could start the primary from scratch, 29 percent picked Trump and 15 percent picked Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Ohio Gov. John Kasich took 9 percent, followed by former neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 8 percent each. The rest of the pack failed to make it past 5 percent."" [HuffPost] TRUMP HAS HAD A ROUGH MONTH IN NATIONAL POLLING - Philip Bump: ""Not only are Trump's poll numbers slipping, they are at a low that no one, Republican or Democrat, has seen in the past three election cycles. Looking at the window of time between 200 and 100 days before each of those elections, you can see that Trump has consistently polled worse than George W. Bush in 2004, John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. He caught up briefly after clinching the GOP nomination — and then sank again. The margin by which he trails Hillary Clinton now mirrors McCain's deficit to Barack Obama in 2008. McCain rebounded after the Republican convention — but it's important to remember that we're comparing Trump to the worst Republican performance in a general election since 1996. There's every reason to think that those numbers will get worse. Trump essentially has no campaign at this point; there's no sign that he has started staffing up significantly."" [WashPost] REPUBLICANS THINK TRUMP’S AGENDA IS DIFFERENT FROM TYPICAL GOP GOALS - Mark Blumenthal: ""When Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan announced his support for Donald Trump in early June, he expressed confidence that Trump would advance Republican priorities....For better or worse, however, the Republican rank and file sees Trump advancing a unique agenda. In SurveyMonkey’s latest Election Tracking poll, only a third (34%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree that Trump ‘wants to accomplish the same things as most Republicans.’ Nearly two-thirds (63%) say Trump ‘wants to accomplish very different things than most Republicans.’"" [SurveyMonkey] VOTERS TRUST TRUMP ON ECONOMY; CLINTON ON FOREIGN POLICY - Dana Blanton:""More American voters trust Donald Trump to do a better job than Hillary Clinton on the issue most say will decide their vote this year: the economy. But, Clinton tops Trump in other key areas, including foreign policy -- and nuclear weapons. That’s according to a new Fox News national poll on top issues in the 2016 election. Relatively few voters, 26 percent, feel they’re better off now compared to before President Barack Obama took office. So it should be no surprise about four voters in 10 -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- say the economy will be the issue that decides their vote for president (39 percent). No other issue comes close. Here’s how the others rank: 14 percent say national security will be most important in their vote, 10 percent each for education and health care, and 8 percent each for immigration and social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Voters trust Trump to do a better job on the top two. He bests Clinton by 12 points on both the economy (53-41 percent) and terrorism (52-40 percent). Meanwhile, Clinton has the edge on social issues (+12 points), education (+10), foreign policy (+10), health care (+3), and immigration (+2)."" [Fox News] 'REMAIN' COULD BE GAINING MOMENTUM IN BREXIT POLLS - William James: ""Three opinion polls ahead of Thursday's vote showed the 'Remain' camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remained one of an evenly split electorate. The killing of Jo Cox, [a lawmaker supportive of the EU membership and] a 41-year-old mother of two young children, shocked Britain, raised questions about the tone of campaigning and could yet prove a defining moment in what is Britain's biggest political decision for decades. The only opinion poll fully carried out since the killing showed support for 'In' at 45 percent, ahead of 'Out' on 42 percent - a reversal of the 3-point lead the pollster, Survation, showed for 'Out' in a poll conducted on Wednesday....Two other polls published on Saturday showed the 'Remain' campaign had regained its lead over 'Leave', while another showed the two camps running neck and neck. But pollsters said most of these surveys were carried out before Thursday's attack and thus did not reflect the full impact of the event.""","The story of Trump, then, is about a committed minority of Republican voters, whose existence was routinely ignored, gradually taking over the entire party."

1165,"WASHINGTON — The alien worlds known as ""super-Earths"" may be more like our own planet than previously thought, a new study suggests. Super-Earths — exoplanets slightly larger than Earth — are common throughout the Milky Way galaxy, but because of their massive gravity, scientists have assumed they should be water worlds. According to a new model, however, tectonically active super-Earths likely store most of their water in the mantle, leaving exposed continents and oceans that could create a stable climate such as that of Earth. ""The temperate climate on Earth is not just because of liquid water, but because of exposed continents,"" study researcher Nicolas Cowan of Northwestern University said here Tuesday (Jan. 7) at the 223rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The surface temperatures of continents act as a kind of geological thermostat, stabilizing the climate. [The Strangest Alien Planets (Gallery)] A super-Earth with twice the radius of Earth would have 10 times the mass and 10 times the amount of water as Earth. The big planet's gravity would be three times as large as Earth's, squashing the planet's topography by a factor of three and creating shallow ocean basins, researchers said. Given so much water and a shallow place to contain it, conventional wisdom holds that a super-Earth's oceans should overflow their basins and inundate the exoplanet. However, on Earth, a lot of water is stored in the mantle— the rocky layer that makes up most of the planet's volume and mass — and moves between the oceans and mantle as tectonic plates shift. Seafloor pressure, determined by gravity, controls this process. Cowan and colleagues modeled water storage on super-Earths, finding that the heftier gravity would create massive pressure on the seafloor, forcing water into the planet's mantle. ""We can put 80 times more water on a super-Earth and still have its surface look like Earth,"" Cowan said in a statement. As a result, these planets should have landmasses that stabilize the climate, instead of being submerged in oceans. If these planets, which are relatively common in the galaxy, turn out to have stable climates, their ability to support life as we know would be higher than previously thought. Of course, the gravity on such worlds is much greater — perhaps three times as large — but Cowan doesn't believe that rules out life. ""I don't think 3-G is a big problem for habitability,"" Cowan told SPACE.com, adding, ""fighter pilots can handle it."" The researchers' model contains two major uncertainties, however. It assumes that super-Earths have plate tectonics, and it relies on estimates of the amount of water in Earth's mantle. The next step to confirm the model's findings would entail launching a high-contrast imaging mission in space to take pictures of these super-Earths and verify that they actually do have continents and oceans. ""Our model is a shot from the hip, but it’s an important step in advancing how we think about super-Earths,"" Cowan said.","""super-Earths"" may be more like our own planet than previously thought"
1166,"Move over, Moss: There's a new Kate in town. California girl Kate Bosworth has taken her style to Topshop, unveiling a winter collection with the fast fashion emporium this week. While Bosworth modeled (and sang!) for Topshop's holiday campaign last year, this is her first full-fledged line for the British brand. The Collection, as Topshop as imaginatively dubbed Bosworth's line, has a higher price point than the high street shop's typical wares; luxe items like leather pants and sheepskin coats ring up for $590 and $995, respectively. Kate kept the palette narrow, designing clothes, shoes and accessories that don't deviate from basic black, white, red and tan. The Collection offers a minimal way to replicate Kate's streamlined chic. As Women's Wear daily quotes Bosworth, the line offers ""luxurious pieces with a strong minimalist approach"" that remained faithful to ""the mix of masculine-feminine balance that exists in my personal aesthetic."" After seeing Bosworth's line, we've gotta admit that she's poised to be a bona fide competitor to Kate Moss' legendary Topshop collaborations.

1168,"On Star Trek, we hear a lot of ""stardates,"" meant to mark some futuristic date. An example is stardate 47457.1, which is Captain Picard's birthday. The weird thing is that stardate 47457.1 is either the equivalent June 16th, November 4th, January 8th, or January 10th, depending on how you count. Let's go deep-nerd on this. The Original Series In the original Trek TV series, stardates were, in a word, bogus. In the series bible, the Star Trek Guide, writers were basically told to wing it. Here's a snippet (emphasis added): Pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point [ed. note: tenths digit], use it as your story's stardate. For example, 1313.5 is twelve o'clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of one day. The progression of stardates in your script should remain constant but don't worry about whether or not there is a progression from other scripts. Stardates are a mathematical formula which varies depending on location in the galaxy, velocity of travel, and other factors, can vary widely from episode to episode. This obviously wasn't thought through very well, as it boils down to ""Pick a number and stay near it."" Show creator Gene Roddenberry later said: When we began making episodes, we would use a stardate such as 2317 one week, and then a week later when we made the next episode we would move the star date up to 2942, and so on. Unfortunately, however, the episodes are not aired in the same order in which we filmed them. So we began to get complaints from the viewers, asking, ""How come one week the star date is 2891, the next week it's 2337, and then the week after it's 3414?"" He then went on to explain that the whole ""location in the galaxy, velocity of travel, and other factors"" thing was a hedge to cover up the fact that the dates simply weren't consistent to begin with, even if the episodes had aired in order. The Next Generation In Star Trek: The Next Generation, things got a bit more consistent. In the original TNG Writer's/Director's Guide, the show-runners devised a sensible formula with a reasonable level of continuity. Here it is: A stardate is a five-digit number followed by a decimal point and one more digit. Example: ""41254.7."" The first two digits of the stardate are always ""41."" The 4 stands for 24th century, the 1 indicates first season. The additional three leading digits will progress unevenly during the course of the season from 000 to 999. The digit following the decimal point is generally regarded as a day counter. It's interesting to note, then, that the duration of a TNG season is 1,000 days. Good thing they were on a continuing mission rather than a five-year one. Both Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and Star Trek: Voyager continued using the TNG style of Stardates, and the movie Star Trek Nemesis followed suit. As you might expect, early on in TNG, the writers sometimes goofed. A prime example is Tasha Yar's death, which occurred circa Stardate 41601.3, but she was alive in a previous episode with the (later) Stardate 41997.7. Oops. By 1992, the writers had revised their guidelines to be iron-clad: A Stardate is a five-digit number followed by a decimal point and one more digit. Example: ""46254.7"". The first two digits of the Stardate are ""46."" The 4 stands for the 24th Century, the 6 indicates sixth season. The following three digits will progress consecutively during the course of the season from 000 to 999. The digit following the decimal point counts tenths of a day. Stardate 45254.4, therefore, represents the noon hour on the 254th ""day"" of the fifth season. Because Stardates in the 24th Century are based on a complex mathematical formula, a precise correlation to Earth-based dating systems is not possible. Despite explicitly stating that correlation to Earth-based dates is not possible, that hasn't stopped people from trying. The Reboot Just when things were basically making sense, they changed again. From an exhaustive and brilliant article on Memory Alpha, here's an explanation of the reboot (J.J. Abrams-directed) movies' treatment of stardates (emphasis added): The stardate format from the latest film series is credited to screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. According to Orci, they ""used the system where, for example, 2233.45 or whatever means 23rd century, 33rd year of that century, and the .45 indicates the day of the year out of 365 days."" During a Q&A session, Orci restated that a stardate is ""the year, as in 2233, with the month and day expressed as a decimal point from .1 to .365 (as in the 365 days of the year)."" He posted a similar reply on Twitter: ""star date=standard year, with decimal representing day of year from 1-365."" The new stardates are similar to the ordinal dates of ISO 8601, which express the first day of 2260 as 2260-001, and the last as 2260-366. Orci hasn't clarified whether leap days increase the count to .366, which would be expected if the years are Gregorian. When asked about 2230.06 and 2233.04 from the Star Trek screenplay, with only one leading zero instead of two or none, he replied that it could have been an error. IDW's Star Trek: Timelines show the latter number as 2233.4. Long Story Short There is no one answer to how stardates work, aside from saying that they don't. They're inconsistent series-to-series, and even within a given series, the writers often mixed things up. With Roddenberry trying to retcon the system's continuity even in TOS, perhaps it's appropriate that the system continues to be more than a little mixed up. Time-tracking throughout the galaxy is a hard problem; give 'em some slack. If you're curious about examples of various Stardates (and even more discussion of this issue), check out Memory Alpha's stardate page. Trust me, once you've read that, you'll never want to speak of this subject again. If you do, read this page for a deeply unofficial (but supremely logical) system of decimal time. Oh, and don't forget the time the French made a 10-hour day—another attempt to create decimal time that led to total confusion.","Pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point [ed. note: tenths digit], use it as your story's stardate. For example, 1313.5 is twelve o'clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of one day.

1173,"Congratulations. From this day forward, you will no longer squander your time trying to work out the perfect regex to validate email addresses. You will also never again run the risk of rejecting what is, in fact, a strange, valid email address. The trick is to first define what we mean by ‘valid’. We are developers, we are technical folk, so it’s no surprise that the prevailing wisdom is to check that it matches the official criteria, some examples of the diversity of the official criteria are... But I say pish! to prevailing wisdom, so... Everything you know is wrong Instead of the above approach that largely ignores reality, I believe there are two questions we need to ask: Did the user understand that they were supposed to type an email address into this field? Did the user correctly type their email address into this field? If you have a well laid-out form with a label that says ""email"", and the user enters an ‘@’ symbol somewhere, then it’s safe to say they understood that they were supposed to be entering an email address. Easy. Next, we want to do some validation to ascertain if they correctly entered their email address. Not possible. It’s important that you agree with me on this point: it’s not possible. I know what you’re thinking. ""But it helps, right?"" That’s like saying that opening and closing your fridge really quickly conserves energy and helps fight climate change. Sure, it helps, if we want to be slaves to the word ‘help’. But most people would agree you have a promising career in a straight jacket if you’re unnecessarily rattling your pickle jars for the benefit of the polar bears. Let’s explore Let’s imagine that my email address is davidgilbertson@example.com. That’s 27 stabs at the keyboard that could go awry. Any mistype will definitely result in an incorrect email address but only maybe result in an invalid email address. Even if the sun shone through my window and I was visited by a particularly savage sneeze (I suffer from Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst Syndrome*) and I typed out #!$%&’*+-/=?^_`{}|~@example.com by mistake, I would still pass the most thorough email ‘validation’ techniques. (The flip side is I fail and be told my address isn’t valid when it is! On a whim I just emailed the person at #!$%&’*+-/=?^_`{}|~@example.com and she said she gets super pissed off when told that her email address isn’t valid. She regrets buying the example.com domain, too, but won’t give it up, just like the guy that’s got milk.com. We got chatting and it turns out she only lives a few blocks from me and also collects vintage cameras we’re playing golf next week. I think maybe she’s the one. I should probably close these brackets and get on with the story.) So what are the odds that any one typo would result in an invalid email address? We will build a statistical model! Let’s look at, say, the ‘g’. I am more likely to mis-type with a letter on the visible keyboard with no shift key required (I apply a weighting to non-modified keys in the model). From all of the tappable keys on a physical keyboard, there are six characters that, while not completely invalid, are only valid in certain cases: []\, and space. 6 out of 48. A 12% chance. But an off-by-one error is more likely. For example hitting the neighbouring ‘h’ key instead of ‘g’. So from a list of 117 million email addresses I have calculated the frequency of occurrence of each character and for each, noted which keys lie closest on the keyboard, and factored in the likelihood that a mis-stroke will create an invalid email address. (I know hacking LinkedIn just to make a point about email validation is a bit extreme, but it is important to back up one’s opinions with data). For example, ‘e’ is considered a low risk of invalidating, because all surrounding keys would still result in a valid email address. But ‘p’ has [ and  within striking distance! So although it’s less common than ‘e’, it carries a higher risk of resulting in an invalid email address if missed. I also consider the relative dexterity of the fingers. We all know that the pinky is the retarded cousin of the finger family, so that is factored in as well. Now, let’s say Silkie (fox) sits on the shift key and I hit the wrong key on the keyboard. I’m in danger of getting one of 6 bad keys: @:""<> and space. And again, those bad keys are only invalid in certain circumstances. And since it’s more likely that the shift key would be down only for the letters on either side of the @ symbol, and ‘l’ on either side of the @ is considered particularly dangerous. The above is all for a single key, but if I mistype a second key, it is possible that I turn an invalid email address back into a valid one (e.g. adding a \ next to a \). This is, of course, factored into the model. It goes without saying that I’ve gone to a similar level of effort to account for soft keyboards. Remember too that if I mistype the @ symbol, the error will be caught by step one above where I actually check for the existence of an @ as a proxy for a user’s intent to enter an email address. I also built in some general common sense: people with aol email addresses are sloppy typers. Daryls tend to poke at the keys with only their index fingers like they’re afraid each key will burn them. People with ‘z’ in their name use mechanical keyboards and rarely make mistakes. Your basic human axioms. I also factored in the fact that any dot before the @ in gmail addresses is ignored and that ‘f’ and ‘h’ are pretty much the same letter when you think about it. The result So with all of that taken into account, I ran the 117 million email addresses through the model. And the odds that an incorrect email address will be caught by email validation is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000625% I’m afraid I don’t have time to type out the algorithm that totally exists and is indisputably perfect, so you’ll have to take my word for it that this number is not in any way made up. The upshot There is no point in trying to work out if an email address is ‘valid’. A user is far more likely to enter a wrong and valid email address than they are to enter an invalid one. Therefore, you are better off spending your time doing literally any other thing than trying to validate email addresses. The 100% correct way Send your users an activation email.

1175,"For 31 months, the great Conor McGregor seemed all but invincible. Five top-flight opponents entered the cage with him. Before the end of the second stanza, all five had fallen to his mighty hands. Through adversity and injury, against wrestler and striker, one thing held true in the world's most chaotic sport: If McGregor put his fists to another man, that man would fall. Death. Taxes. ""The Notorious"" Conor McGregor's left hand. It's no wonder then. McGregor saw Nate Diaz as just another opponent. Diaz, in theory, was no different than any other man, which is to say he was born to be a victim of the great Conor McGregor. Just a ""fat-skinny guy"" who had failed to claim the throne McGregor sat so firmly upon. Reality intruded, as it so often does in combat sports, in the form of a punch to the face. Diaz's blows, it seemed, knocked the hubris out of McGregor, dropping him, forcing him to shoot for a confused takedown, the gazelle walking right into the lion's den to deliver swift justice. Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images It was there Diaz delivered the coup de grace, what Brazilians call the mata leao—the lion killer. McGregor had reached for the stars but landed with a thud on the unforgiving Octagon mat. The future, once so bright, was very much in doubt And so, just five months removed from his first UFC defeat, McGregor found himself making the long walk to the cage to face Diaz again. This time, he walked first—Diaz may not have held a title belt, but he was champion of this feud, already among the most memorable in UFC history. After 25 minutes, McGregor's hand was raised in victory—a majority decision that drove the internet into convulsions of both anger and joy. Diaz was left to mutter a plaintive ""What the f--k?"" McGregor, gracious in victory, credited his rival with bringing out his best. ""You've got to respect Nate and the style of fighting that he brings,"" McGregor told the media during the post-fight press conference. ""How can you not?"" When the chits were counted at FightMetric, Diaz had landed 166 significant strikes; McGregor scored 164. But fights aren't scored on aggregate. They are judged round-by-round, with effective striking and grappling the defining criteria. Who really won the rematch between Diaz and McGregor? We took a look at the fight to deliver an entirely unofficial scorecard of our own. Round 1 Steve Marcus/Getty Images McGregor knew what he needed to do to beat Diaz. Benson Henderson had written the book on it. Josh Thomson and Rafael Dos Anjos had traced from the same pattern. But devising a game plan and executing it are two different things. Diaz, with his wide stance, resting heavy on his front leg to maximize his boxing game, was born to be victimized by leg kicks. He, like his brother Nick, has a seeming disdain for them, with both men choosing to eat kick after kick rather than adjust their stance or style. Diaz had proved what he could do with his height and reach advantage in the first fight. McGregor would need to utilize the only weapon in his arsenal to re-establish his dominance at distance. The problem? McGregor had thrown only a handful of muay thai-style leg kicks in his entire UFC career, depending instead on linear kicks of the kind Jon Jones popularized. In fact, he expressly eschewed the style, judging its ""flatfooted"" fighters as lacking the movement necessary to keep up with him. McGregor's chances depended on him perfectly executing a technique he had just five months to master—but he came out and did it like a multiple-time veteran of the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium The first five significant strikes of the bout were all McGregor leg kicks. By the end of the round, Diaz's leg was already bruising, and his stance was compromised. By the Numbers: Round 1 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 34/58 0/0 1 Nate Diaz 25/73 0/0 0 FightMetric ""The leg kick is a huge factor in this fight,"" announcer Joe Rogan roared. ""And Conor is using it brilliantly."" Even better, for McGregor at least, the leg kicks opened opportunities for his straight left hand. At 3:19, he dropped a befuddled Diaz to the mat with one, though replay showed clear eyes and a full heart. Gone was the headhunter from the first fight. This McGregor was patient, composed and professional. ""That's the technical difference between the two of us,"" McGregor's trainer John Kavanagh offered as his fighter took a seat in the corner. For McGregor, it was one down and four long rounds to go. Round 1 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 2 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images ""No more free kicks,"" Diaz's corner yelled as the bell sounded to begin Round 2. Obviously listening, he attempted to check a few early, but whether they landed or were deflected, the kicks served their intended purpose: to open up Diaz for McGregor's left hand. The work, at least early in the fight, was much easier for McGregor than it had been in the initial bout. Then, McGregor landed plenty of haymakers, but only rarely were they clean, and he exhausted himself in the process. This time, the leg kicks opened the door for everything else, preventing Diaz from circling away and backing him into the cage where McGregor could tee off with his power hand. Two stunning lefts put Diaz down, though McGregor chose not to engage the Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert on the ground. ""Nate's having a hard time moving on that right leg,"" Rogan offered. ""That could be a factor in why he's falling down like this."" By the Numbers: Round 2 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 34/70 0/0 2 Nate Diaz 37/76 0/0 0 FightMetric In the corner, Kavanagh was suddenly a believer in the power of Thai boxing, calling out, ""On the leg, on the leg."" McGregor obliged and landed a right hand to boot, belying the notion he's a one-handed fighter. For a fighter often criticized as a headhunter in search of knockouts, McGregor maintained his focus brilliantly. Diaz came willing to him and, over and over again, was met with a left-hand counter no matter what he tried. McGregor parried everything that came his way and responded with a straight punch that was more timing than pure speed. ""He's picking him apart right now,"" play-by-play announcer Mike Goldberg said. ""It's all Conor McGregor."" Perhaps that was Diaz's cue—a check hook launched him back into the fight, and a furious combination soon followed. Rogan began selling the idea that McGregor was slowing down, though it wasn't particularly obvious based on his incredible output. The two men exchanged 71 significant strikes in the round and, for the first time, Diaz looked to be competing on even terms. ""We have ourselves a fight,"" Goldberg said. He didn't know how right he'd be. Round 2 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 3 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Diaz often fights with his hands down, sometimes even leaning forward to bait his opponent into a punch. His long frame and arms allow him to either avoid or absorb those blows. His own slapping right hook follows, and then the storm comes—punch after punch until it feels like they will never stop raining down. McGregor's leg kicks had prevented that strategy from coming into play and, on this night at least, his left hand was quicker to launch than Diaz's right. It required a shift in tactics that came into play in the third round. Diaz covered his head with both arms and threw a few awkward kicks of his own, sometimes lifting his knee off the ground, looking to close the distance on his Irish rival instead of countering his charge. McGregor dealt with this change smoothly, sometimes landing stunning elbows when the bigger man attempted to get inside, other times resetting across the cage, causing Diaz to point and the crowd to jeer. By the Numbers: Round 3 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 26/45 0/0 0 Nate Diaz 49/87 0/2 0 FightMetric Perhaps feeling McGregor wilt, Diaz got some of his swagger back in the second half of the round, taunting McGregor, who responded with some of the ""spinning s--t"" Team Diaz despises so much. Eventually, Diaz's tactical adjustments paid off. With just under a minute left, he cornered McGregor against the cage, put the top of his head down on the short man's chin and proceeded to go to work Diaz-style. Punch after punch flowed—to the body, head, arms and air. McGregor never stopped fighting. On slow-motion replay, you can even see him avoiding or mitigating many of the worst blows. But they came in waves, a force of nature, inexorable and unyielding. ""Nate Diaz,"" Goldberg said, ""is looking to finish him right now."" It didn't seem to matter to Diaz where the punches landed. He was throwing them until someone made him stop—and only the bell did that. Round 3 Derek Cleary 10-9 Diaz Jeff Mullen 10-9 Diaz Glenn Trowbridge 10-8 Diaz Bleacher Report 10-9 Diaz Nevada Athletic Commission Round 4 Isaac Brekken/Associated Press While the announcer focused on McGregor's alleged fatigue, the fight's brutality caught up with Diaz in Round 4. The blood poured, and Diaz was forced to constantly sweep it from his eyes. Worse, as his body was failing him, an intellectual challenge presented itself. He had successfully adjusted to McGregor's new game plan in the previous round. Now it was McGregor's turn to show his fight IQ. By the Numbers: Round 4 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 46/76 0/0 0 Nate Diaz 36/63 0/1 0 FightMetric After 15 minutes of relying mostly on leg kicks and left hands, McGregor let his jab fly free. Like the leg kicks, it's never been much of a weapon—but he smoothly danced at a distance, firing away with the kind of lead punch he'd never needed before in a UFC fight. Some of his favored straight kicks to the body followed, and, when Diaz attempted to repeat the feat of closing distance with a heavy guard surrounding his head, McGregor dug shots into his body with vicious glee. We knew prior to this fight that McGregor was a gifted puncher and an excellent finisher. After the fourth round of this bout, we knew something else: He was capable of outsmarting his foes too. Round 4 Derek Cleary 10-9 McGregor Jeff Mullen 10-9 McGregor Glenn Trowbridge 10-9 McGregor Bleacher Report 10-9 McGregor Nevada Athletic Commission Round 5 Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Even after Diaz spent a minute in his corner, blood dripped to the mat as he flexed his muscles at the sound of the bell. ""Look at the blood,"" Rogan said, speaking for us all. ""Good lord."" While the judges' scorecards indicated he needed a finish to win, Diaz saw things differently. There was no sense of purpose or urgency to score a finish. Winning the round, he seemingly thought, would be enough. It wasn't. It was one of the fight's closest. Diaz attempted to push McGregor into the cage, and McGregor continued to land punches. The story was McGregor's takedown defense. Though he didn't ""dominate the clinch"" like Kavanagh claimed in the corner, McGregor more than held his own in the championship rounds. Against the cage, McGregor worked sharp elbows that left Diaz leaking blood and overhooks to avoid meeting the mat. Diaz, of course, was Diaz, managing a collar tie and some nice work. But it was mostly a stalemate—and for McGregor, that was as good as a win. By the Numbers: Round 5 Significant Strikes Takedowns Knockdowns Conor McGregor 24/37 0/1 0 Nate Diaz 19/44 1/4 0 FightMetric As the round approached the halfway point, a frustrated Diaz pointed at a retreating McGregor and then turned his middle finger up to offer a rude salute. McGregor responded with a multiple-strike combination. With 10 seconds left in the fight, Diaz scored the takedown he should have been desperate for. It was too late to mean much of anything. Both men raised their arms high after the bell rang. Both deserved to soak in the applause.

But, though the FightMetric stats showed both men landed significant strikes in almost identical numbers, McGregor scored the cleaner, stronger blows throughout the bout. Though not nearly as definitive as their bout in March, this was McGregor's fight. He took on a bigger, taller, more experienced fighter and did everything necessary to eliminate all those advantages. ""We win, or we learn,"" McGregor told Rogan after the fight. ""I learned from the last contest."" Now it's Diaz's turn to reinvent himself. Bring on the trilogy.

1178,"Virtually all of Twitter’s best ideas weren’t Twitter’s ideas. The 140-character thing? That was so tweets could be text messages. @-replies? Users came up with that well before the platform supported them. People were #tweeting #hashtags to #talk about specific #subjects long before anyone with a Twitter nametag slapped a blue underline on them and created dedicated pages. Retweets? RT @SomeGuy13 ""That was me."" Twitter is lucky to have a base of deeply devoted users, and the company is at its best when it gives those users what they want. And what they want, it turns out, is to be able to talk to each other. This morning, Twitter announced a handful of new features that will be available ""over the coming months,"" whenever that is. No longer will usernames (@wired, @justinbieber, @babyanimals) count against your 140-character limit, at least when you’re replying to someone else’s tweet. Photos, videos, polls, or GIFs never count. (Links still do.)1 You won’t even see some links or usernames, which Twitter now treats more like attachments than part of the tweet. You can now re-tweet or quote-tweet yourself, in case you think the world needs to hear of your genius all over again. And if you start a tweet with ""@"" but aren’t replying to someone—""@wired you’re so great thanks for everything"" if you need an illustrative example—all your followers will still see it. You don’t need a period at the beginning. Now, these changes are important. They are intelligence—about Twitter, and more importantly about how its users use. They are the answers to a how’re-we-doing survey that hundreds of millions of people filled out. So what has Twitter learned about itself? Well, twitterers want to upload pictures and video. They want to self-promote until they’re blue in the face. They want to tweet stuff. And retweet that stuff. Especially if it’s their own stuff. What people don’t want is to spend time remembering the rules of Twitter engagement. They don’t want to mention two people, add a photo, and then have three characters left. They don’t want to have to remember what goes before the @ symbol, why, and when. They don’t want to upload a photo only to be forced to rifle through a thesaurus looking for a shorter word for ""fantastic,"" then give up and use ""gr8"" like it’s 2004 and they’re on AIM again. Social networking is all about instinctive, frictionless sharing, not careful formatting and research. Facebook excels at this: Sure, it can be an inscrutable mix of long-winded political diatribes, 360-degree videos, and old photos of your ex-boyfriend, but something about the freedom it offers to post anything, any way you want, makes people come back. Being interesting in 140 characters is a test of writerly acumen—like that unsourced but wonderful quote says, ""If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."" When most of those characters go to something other than words, the test gets harder. With Facebook as a competitor, Twitter needs to be easy. Of course, Twitter can’t just try and be everything to everyone. ""They don’t want to become Facebook,"" says industry analyst Rob Enderle, ""because then they’d go bye-bye."" Two things define Twitter: It’s fast, and everyone uses it the same way. That’s why, even as rumors fly to the contrary, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others have maintained that the 140-character limit isn’t going anywhere. It’s not so much about the character count itself, Enderle says, but the spirit it creates. ""Twitter just lends itself to that very brief, very fast conversation,"" he says. It makes the product better—Twitter is much faster on mobile than Facebook—and makes the whole place feel more lively. That’s why news types flock to Twitter, for instance: So much is going on. Longer posts would mean fewer posts, and you wouldn’t want to read them as much, and Twitter would be a Frankenstein’s monster made of Medium and Facebook that wouldn’t be any fun at all. That’s why making it easier to post photos, videos, and links is smart. Those are easy ways for people to share more without requiring an hour of focused reading from their followers. Until now, though, Twitter has effectively penalized users for adding them, forcing them to give up 24 precious characters just to add a photo. Now, you get 140 characters for text. Everything else is Twitter’s problem. Some of these features are designed to sate the power users, who are growing restless. At the same time, Twitter the company is desperate to get more people using Twitter the product, and sticking around once they do. That depends in many ways on giving users, especially new ones, ways to find and interact with great tweets. The best organizational tool on Twitter is hashtags, without which Twitter’s still not smart enough to know what you’re talking about. A 2012 study called hashtags ""first-order organizational acts."" They don’t foster conversation, but they do sort it. Twitter’s biggest problem is that people try it, get bored by lack of engagement, and leave. Hashtags are a surprisingly powerful way to help people engage; not counting them might convince people to use them more. You could convincingly argue that Twitter still hasn’t fixed its biggest problems. Harassment and trolling make the service a hostile place for many users. Its relationship with the developer community is broken. And Facebook is out there, pushing into live video and all things real-time. You could argue those things, and I wouldn’t disagree with you. Still, Dorsey and co. are smart to see that Twitter is the most fun to use when you’re using it with other people. You’re getting in canoes with twelve people and @Dennys, you’re captioning the latest memes, you’re watching the Oscars alongside a million people not in your living room. Twitter is Twitter because Twitter moves fast, and because everyone’s in the pile together. That might mean you need a character limit, but it makes just about everything else fungible. If Twitter can avoid becoming a broadcast medium and instead remain the place the world goes to talk about stuff, Twitter might still have a chance.","No longer will usernames (@wired, @justinbieber, @babyanimals) count against your 140-character limit, at least when you’re replying to someone else’s tweet.

1183,"If you're looking for a narcissist, just ask. That’s according to a new video produced by New York Magazine’s The Science of Us, based on research last year that suggested you only need one question to find out which of your friends is really, really into themselves. Just ask them upfront: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement: I am a narcissist."" Apparently this question relies on the fact that a true narcissist will be unlikely to think of their narcissism as a bad thing. In the study of over 2,000 people of all ages, participants were asked to rate themselves on a scale of 1 (not very true of me) to 7 (very true of me). ""People who are willing to admit they are more narcissistic than others probably actually are more narcissistic,"" said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University. This method takes up a lot less time than the 40 question Narcissistic Personality Inventory, which was developed by Robert Raskin and Howard Terry in 1979. Since then, there have been plenty of studies into what makes a person a narcissist, and how we can become more self-aware in an age where the word ""selfie"" was awarded word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary in 2013.","""People who are willing to admit they are more narcissistic than others probably actually are more narcissistic,"""

""I know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again,"" Wright said at the time. ""We have to own that. But it's not going to define us within our program.

It sweeps away everything that came before. The 2016-17 Duke Blue Devils were the overwhelming preseason favorite, spent most of the season managing injuries, their iconic coach's absence, and a five-alarm Grayson Allen fire, and if they go 6-0 from here, no one will remember or care. Baylor went from unranked in the preseason to its first-ever No. 1 ranking (on Jan. 9); if the Bears are upset for the third straight season, the story of that success will vanish. The Northwestern Wildcats have spent their entire basketball existence in a generationally futile struggle. Now, finally, they've arrived, and poof: 77 years of failure gone, just like that. A variation of these stakes exist for every team, on every line, of this brand-new bracket. The tournament will define them all, one way or the other, by what happens next. Just ask Villanova. On an infinite time scale, a No. 16/No. 1 upset is a mathematical certainty. Until then, these tiny teams with big seeds are just thrilled for the chance to Dance. 68. Texas Southern Tigers Mike Davis arrived in Houston's Third Ward five years ago. This is the third time his Tigers have captured the SWAC's automatic bid. That's two more tournament trips than he made in the six seasons he spent at UAB -- and exactly as many, in exactly as many seasons, as Davis experienced as Bob Knight's successor at Indiana. Go figure. 67. North Carolina Central Eagles Eagles' opponents shot 29.1 percent from 3, the third-worst mark in Division I, and 63.1 percent from the free throw line, worst in the sport. This probably says more about the MEAC than about NC Central, but, hey, do with this information what you will. 66. Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers The Mountaineers took the customary low-major lumps in nonconference play, playing West Virginia, Iowa State, Minnesota and Michigan in a nine-game, season-opening road trip. They started 1-11; they finished 17-4. 65. UC Davis Aggies One of four first-timers in the 2017 NCAA tournament, the Aggies thrive thanks to Canberra, Australia, native Chima Moneke, who grabbed a Caleb Swanigan-esque 29.6 percent of available defensive rebounds this season. 64. Troy Trojans After Texas State made an excellent UT Arlington the 2016-17 season's chief conference tournament victim, Troy -- which finished 10-8 in the Sun Belt but owned the league's most efficient offense -- seized their chance. 63. New Orleans Privateers First things first: great nickname. Every third school calls itself the Pirates, but those ruffians lack the sponsorship of crown authority! Bah! Second: New Orleans returned all five starters from a 10-win season, coughed up turnovers at a higher rate than all but two Division I teams and shot 32 percent from 3 ... and still played itself into the Dance. Respect. 62. Jacksonville State Gamecocks What are the odds of having two different sets of Gamecocks in the same NCAA tournament? Better than Jacksonville State's odds of winning a game therein, sure. But still. 61. North Dakota Fighting Hawks The Fighting Hawks became a full-fledged Division I member in 2009-2010. It took Northwestern 77 years to get into the NCAA tournament; it took North Dakota seven. 60. South Dakota State Jackrabbits A season ago, South Dakota State forward Mike Daum was the breakout newcomer on a very good mid-major outfit. These Jackrabbits struggled, but they're back in the NCAA tournament in large part thanks to Daum's 25.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game -- and the beast-mode 34 and 12 he put on Omaha in SDSU's two-point Summit League championship win. 59. Kent State Golden Flashes The Golden Flashes got here with a conference tourney run of unmatched epicness: A 116-106 overtime win over Central Michigan followed by three wins in three days over its league's top three seeds by an average of 3.3 points -- culminating in a title game win that not only earned them a bid but spoiled rival Akron's 26-win season. MACtion knows no season. 58. Northern Kentucky Norse Not only does Northern Kentucky have one of the best team nicknames under Odin's beard, but its mascot, Victor E. Viking (!), is genuinely terrifying. What more do you need to know? 57. Iona Gaels For the second straight season, Iona's trademark blend of up-tempo offense, long-range shooting and defensive indifference was enough to swipe a bid out from under the two best teams (and benches) in Monmouth Hawks history. 56. Winthrop Eagles Winthrop won at Illinois, held opponents under 47 percent (effective) shooting, and is led by Keon Johnson, a 5-foot-7 senior guard who took 235 3s this season -- and shot 40 percent. If you're looking for a random first-round upset flier, this might be the way to go. 55. Florida Gulf Coast Eagles Since the great Dunk City incursion of 2013 -- a tournament run so memorable Google's first result for ""Dunk City"" is Florida Gulf Coast men's basketball -- former Bill Self assistant Joe Dooley, making FGCU's second-straight tournament appearance, has turned a fun one-off story into a legitimate mid-major program. A smattering of upset culprits hailing from non-power leagues. 54. Bucknell Bison The Patriot League's best team by a wide margin shot 54.6 percent from 2 and 37.7 percent from 3; the Bison were one of the 25-or-so most accurate teams in the country. 53. East Tennessee State Buccaneers The Buccaneers swat a bunch of shots, swipe a mess of steals and turn opponents over on the reg, while lead guard T.J. Cromer capably carries a massive share of the offensive load. If ETSU isn't turning the ball over itself -- and it did so on nearly 21 percent of its possessions this season - it's as dangerous as any mid-major in the field. 52. Vermont Catamounts Vermont went to the brink of disaster in the America East title game: With 17 seconds to play and his team up by three, freshman star Anthony Lamb heaved a head-scratching inbounds pass 60 feet upcourt, giving Albany an unexpected chance to tie. The Great Danes couldn't capitalize. This was just. The 29-5 Catamounts last lost Dec. 21 at Butler. They went unbeaten in their league and won 21 straight -- the nation's longest active streak, and one that might get longer yet. 51. UNC Wilmington Seahawks UNC Wilmington gets buckets. More accurately, UNC Wilmington gets shots. Kevin Keatts' team earned its second straight tourney spot by shooting 56 percent inside the arc while hoisting a healthy diet of 3s, earning second chances at the offensive glass, and turning the ball over fewer times per possession (13.9 percent) than any team in Division I. More shots means more points. Easy to understand, brutal to guard. 50. Princeton Tigers The Ivy League's undefeated regular-season champion and winner of its first-ever conference tournament (which included a stacked-deck overtime semifinal against Penn at the Palestra) is Bo Ryan-era Wisconsin for the elite coastal set. The Tigers do everything well defensively (especially on the glass), slow the pace, and rarely turn the ball over. Meanwhile, no tournament team generated more of its offense (41.7 percent) from beyond the arc. Three is more than two? Pshh. These Ivy League kids think they're so smart. 49. Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders Trigger warning for Michigan State fans: The architects of one of the greatest upsets in NCAA tournament history -- last season's 15-over-2 shocker that sent one of Tom Izzo's best, most harmonious teams home in the first round -- are back. They're also better. Last year's Blue Raiders went temporarily unconscious for one afternoon. The 2017 edition, which generates more of its points from inside the arc (58 percent) than any other team in the field, has been lighting it up for four months. (Mostly) power-conference teams that (probably) won't leave a lasting impression on the field. 48. USC Trojans With all due respect to Andy Enfield's improving program, which is now in its second-straight NCAA tournament, the Trojans barely outscored Pac-12 opposition per possession this season, are liked much less by advanced metrics than the silly old RPI, and have that unmistakable whiff of one-and-out about them. 47. New Mexico State Aggies Marvin Menzies went to five NCAA tournaments in nine years in Las Cruces, N.M., and four in his last five years. His off-the-beaten-path program building landed him the job at UNLV (albeit under unusual circumstances). While Menzies figures out how to make the Runnin' Rebels relevant, the Aggies' succession has proven seamless. 46. Rhode Island Rams Rhode Island entered the season with top-25 expectations, mostly thanks to the return of senior guard E.C. Matthews from 2015's knee injury. Rhody never quite lived up to that billing, but a tourney bid will do. 45. Nevada Wolf Pack Longtime NBA coaching journeyman Eric Musselman may belong to college basketball's increasingly random ""Whoa, that NBA guy coaches there?!"" fraternity -- led by co-presidents Dan Majerle (University of Phoenix) and Mike Dunleavy Sr. (Tulane, seriously) -- but he has done a bang-up job in just his second season at Nevada. The Wolf Pack were the Mountain West's best, and while that may not mean what it did when Jimmer Fredette and Kawhi Leonard were around, it's an impressive accomplishment all the same. 44. Kansas State Wildcats Bruce Weber's team may not be pretty -- which is a polite way of saying it's pretty brutal to watch -- but the Wildcats forced more turnovers than any Big 12 team not nicknamed ""Press Virginia,"" and they beat Baylor twice. So there's that. 43. Vanderbilt Commodores Teams with 14 losses rarely receive at-large bids. No team with 15 losses ever has before. Yet here Vanderbilt is, thanks not only to a comically shallow bubble but, to be fair, to first-year coach Bryce Drew's willingness to embrace the 3-point shot (and why not) as the Commodores' great equalizer. (Oh, and the wins over Florida. Those helped a lot.) 42. Xavier Musketeers Xavier opened the season with top-15 expectations, looked the part for weeks, then lost guard Edmond Sumner to injury and spent February and early March losing to every Big East team not named DePaul. Then came the conference tournament, where the Musketeers redeemed themselves with a win over Butler, and hey: Maybe there's a happy ending to this story yet. 41. Wake Forest Demon Deacons Center John Collins takes 30 percent of Wake Forest's shots, shoots 62 percent from the field, grabs nearly 17 percent of available offensive rebounds, and draws almost eight fouls for every 40 minutes of basketball he plays. Wake's shaky defense nearly kept it out of the field, but lawd is that kid a beast. 40. Providence Friars Ed Cooley's team spent most of the season off the radar, and started Big East play 4-8, before going on a six-game tear to close the regular season. If shots are falling, Providence can play with anybody; if they're not, things can get ugly. 39. Michigan State Spartans Yes, Tom Izzo is Tom Izzo, which is another way of saying this team will probably, somehow, end up in the Elite Eight. Still, chill. Strip away the aura of Marches past (except, you know, last year) and what you're left with is a really young, undeniably talented team that turns the ball over way too much, doesn't force turnovers of its own, doesn't grab offensive rebounds, doesn't get to the line, and commits way too many fouls on the other end. Proceed with caution. 38. Seton Hall Pirates Not unlike conference brethren Providence, Seton Hall started Big East play with three wins in nine games before righting the ship in a 7-2 finish down the stretch. This team rebounds it well on both ends, and Khadeen Carrington, Angel Delgado and Desi Rodriguez can form like Voltron when everything is clicking. Still, the Pirates gave up more than they got per possession in 18 Big East games. Don't go too crazy. 37. Marquette Golden Eagles Anyone up for a fast-paced, high-scoring, defense-optional first-round game? Marquette is the team for you! The Golden Eagles boast one of the nation's most efficient offenses. No team in Division I shoots it better from 3 (43.0 percent). Only Villanova was better in Big East play (and not by all that much). Unfortunately, Marquette also boasts the worst defense of any Big East team not named DePaul. To review: great offense, bad defense, occasionally effective, always fun. 36. VCU Rams Second-year coach Will Wade has VCU in the tournament yet again, with a roster that is yet again forcing a healthy number of turnovers. The defining legacy of Shaka Smart's tenure at the school has now blended into an evolving mix of styles -- including better first-shot and interior defense than at any time in recent program history. 35. Dayton Flyers This is Dayton's fourth straight appearance under coach Archie Miller, which is why you'll hear so much in the next few weeks about the various programs vying for Miller's services. In the meantime, the Flyers -- who record an assist on 61 percent of their made field goals -- will see how far their unselfish, balanced attack will take them. 34. Maryland Terrapins A third season in College Park wasn't Melo Trimble's plan. After a brilliant freshman season, Trimble was a preseason player of the year candidate as a sophomore before a solid but vaguely disappointing season (relative to expectations) -- both for him and for his team -- cooled the NBA's interest. Yet as the only returning starter surrounded by a bevy of promising youngsters, Trimble has once again flashed the ability to carry his team's offense -- sometimes singlehandedly. 33. Arkansas Razorbacks Arkansas drew little national attention this season, and as late as the first week of February, after losses to Missouri and Vanderbilt, the Razorbacks looked like just another mediocre SEC team. By the time the season was over Mike Anderson's team was pushing Kentucky's legion of lottery picks for the title of SEC's best offense. 32. South Carolina Gamecocks Last March's infamous bracket leak overshadowed another minor Selection Sunday disaster: When South Carolina -- one of the first bubble teams left out of the field -- was mistakenly included in a group text congratulating teams for making the NCAA tournament. Whoops! No such clerical issues were in play this year; star wing Sindarius Thornwell and one of the nation's best defenses made sure of that. 31. Virginia Tech Hokies With all due respect to the Hokies' players -- who have fulfilled last year's ""look out for Virginia Tech"" proclamations with Zach LeDay's versatility, brilliant perimeter shooting and plenty of aplomb -- the real star of the show is on the sideline, where coach Buzz Williams has taken up the Gary Williams perspiration torch. Williams starts each game in a three-piece suit; he rarely ends one in it. A few weeks ago, he spent an entire second half in a T-shirt. He's a prop bet waiting to happen. 30. Miami Hurricanes In 2013, after a win that sent Miami to its first Sweet 16 in 13 years, coach Jim Larranaga gave birth to the greatest college hoops gif of the past half decade. In 2015, he whipped and/or nae nae'd. This happened in February. If there's any reason for the uninvested to root for the Hurricanes in March, it's in the hope college basketball's resident adorable grandpa will dance like no one's watching. Living history. 29. Northwestern Wildcats Here are the facts, and boy do they bear repeating: Northwestern's last winning Big Ten record came in 1968. Before 2015-16, Northwestern had never won 20 games in a regular season; it had never broken the 20-win threshold, period. The first NCAA tournament was held in 1939 in Evanston, Illinois. The NCAA tournament has included at least 64 teams for 32 years. Northwestern was the only power conference team in college basketball history -- the only one -- never to make the NCAA tournament. It is almost impossible to fathom the epochal end these 2016-17 Wildcats represent. Compare them to the (World champion!) Chicago Cubs if you like, but then imagine if the Cubs went 100 years without once making the playoffs. That's what we're talking about here. That's how winning 21 games in the regular season, finishing 10-8 in the Big Ten, and sliding into the back half of a 68-team NCAA tournament field makes you legendary. And don't get it twisted: Whatever happens later this week, Chris Collins and his players are already legends. The official category of the pondering emoji, full of flawed teams who might just go to the Final Four anyway. 28. Minnesota Golden Gophers As jaw-dropping as Northwestern's presence in this field is, Minnesota sure gave its league foes a real run for plot-twist primacy. The Golden Gophers won eight games last season. Eight! Richard Pitino suspended or dismissed five players; the athletic director who hired him, Norwood Teague, resigned in disgrace the previous summer; a school audit in May found he had drastically overspent his travel budget in his first two seasons. The idea of Minnesota anywhere near the NCAA tournament was laughable. No one's laughing now. 27. Creighton Bluejays The last time Creighton went to the tournament, coach Greg McDermott's son Doug was getting buckets and winning player of the year awards. For a while there, this team looked even better. An 18-1 start was the best in program history, and folks in Omaha, Nebraska, were talking Final Four. That dream ended alongside point guard Maurice Watson's season, but Marcus Foster and breakout NBA prospect Justin Patton remain a potent offensive brew. 26. Wisconsin Badgers Wisconsin spent the first three months of the 2016-17 season as a top-10 team and presumptive Big Ten favorite; the Badgers have spent the past five weeks trying to figure out why the ball won't go in the basket. The Badgers shot 46.9 percent from 2, 34 percent from 3 and 62 percent from the free throw line in 18 Big Ten games. If, mercifully, those shots start falling, Ethan Happ, Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig will seem dangerously underseeded. If not, the postseason could be brief. 25. Michigan Wolverines Michigan's postseason took one of the scariest turns in recent college hoops memory before it even began. On March 8, departing for the Big Ten tournament in Washington D.C., the Wolverines' team plane aborted takeoff amid high winds, at which point it skidded off the runway into the airport equivalent of a roadside ditch. When the dust had settled and everyone had recovered, John Beilein called a team meeting and asked his players whether they still wanted to go to D.C. People would have understood, you know? Instead Michigan showed up at the Verizon Center the following morning and, clad in practice uniforms, promptly smacked Illinois by 20. Does it get more hard-core? 24. Iowa State Cyclones Monte Morris has spent his entire career in Ames, Iowa, defying the ballhandling odds, but his senior season has been special, even by his own lofty standards. Since 1996-97, no one's averaged 35 minutes, 5.0 assists and 1.0 turnovers in a season; against Big 12 competition, Morris averaged a mistake once every 47 minutes he was on the floor. When coaches dream, they dream of having a point guard like Morris. When they wake up, they have to figure out how to stop the offense he powers. Few manage. 23. Saint Mary's Gaels By most reasonable measures, the 2016-17 Gaels were good enough to be the West Coast Conference's best team in just about any other year in recorded human history. This is probably the best Saint Mary's team ever. This season, unfortunately, Gonzaga happened to be a juggernaut. Tough break. The good news: Now we get to see how uber-efficient center Jock Landale and his hot-shooting Australian brethren stack up with the rest of country. Finally. 22. Notre Dame Fighting Irish Once besmirched in the same breath as Wisconsin and Virginia for its sloth -- and, to be fair, Notre Dame did have a whole offense, ""burn,"" designed around killing clock -- the Irish are now a testament to basketball's modern positional revolution. Notre Dame's center, Bonzie Colson, is a 6-foot-5 converted former wing who's having an All-American season at the fulcrum of a precisely spaced outside-in offensive attack. It's as beautiful as it is effective. 21. Florida Gators Save a season here and a season there, Florida basketball was basically nonexistent until 1996, when Gators athletic director Jeremy Foley hired a 30-year-old Rick Pitino protege named Billy Donovan. In 2015, after two unprecedented decades of success, Foley's task -- finding Donovan's replacement -- was twice as daunting. He chose Mike White. Two-for-two. An injury to top shot-blocker John Egbunu and back-to-back March losses to Vanderbilt have taken some of the shine off what once was one of the nation's hottest teams, but if these suddenly reborn, post-Billy D Gators are locked in, look out. 20. Cincinnati Bearcats Mick Cronin has exclusively fielded athletic, physical, defense-driven teams during his tenure at Cincinnati. None have worn it better than this one. The Bearcats are customarily rowdy on the offensive glass, but they truly thrive at forcing misses inside the arc on the defensive end, which they do better than every team in the country that (a) isn't Gonzaga or (b) doesn't have a 7-foot-6 center (Tacko Fall, UCF). 19. SMU Mustangs In the first season of the post-Larry Brown era (which went exactly as expected, for better and for worse), here's what you need to know about SMU: (1) Semi Ojeleye, a former blue-chip Duke recruit, is 6-foot-7, shoots 43 percent from 3, and is one of the most efficient volume scorers in college hoops; (2) Shake Milton is really good at basketball, but also his name is Shake Milton, so the previous phrase is redundant; (3) Tim Janovich's Mustangs shoot the lights out, rebound their own misses, don't send opponents to the free throw line, and do pretty much everything else you can do while on a basketball court either well or very well. Relative to seed, no team this side of Wichita State will scare its bracket neighbors so comprehensively. 18. Oklahoma State Cowboys Oklahoma State started Big 12 play 0-6. First-year coach Brad Underwood, whom you may remember from such films as ""The Guy Who Coached That Awesome Dude With The Beard That Beat No. 3-Seed West Virginia Last Year,"" pulled things back on defense -- which had given up 1.19 points per trip in those six losses attempting to play Underwood's high-impact Stephen F. Austin style -- and subsequently soaked up wins in 10 of the Cowboys' next 11 games. Along the way, Jawun Evans (perhaps the nation's best passer) and chums usurped UCLA in two ways: They became the nation's most efficient offensive team, per KenPom.com, and the one most likely to draw the old ""but what about stops?!"" bracket skepticism. UCLA's defense isn't all that bad. OSU's defense is still pretty rough. Fair enough. But when you score it like this -- and Underwood's team still gave up 1.06 points per trip (!) in that 10-1 streak down the stretch -- who cares? 17. Butler Bulldogs Remember when Butler was a cute, cuddly Horizon League underdog? Remember how it almost shocked the world? Feels like a long time ago, huh? While Brad Stevens and Gordon Hayward were busy tearing up their respective corners of the NBA, Chris Holtmann, now three-for-three on NCAA bids in his tenure, has carried a program best known for its storybook qualities into a future of perennial Big East contention. 16. Florida State Seminoles Despite all visual evidence to the contrary, Leonard Hamilton is 68 years old. (No, seriously!) This is his 30th college season. This might be his best team ever. It's undoubtedly the best he has had in a decade and a half at Florida State -- most of the time, anyway. Dwayne Bacon, Terance Mann, Xavier Rathan-Mayes and impossibly long wunderkind Jonathan Isaac form one of the most talented, athletic cores in the sport. When they're flying up and down the floor, seizing mismatches and attacking the rim, as they were for most of the 2016-17 season, they're one of the best teams in the country. But when they're bad, they're really bad. 15. Virginia Cavaliers At the dawn of coach Tony Bennett's ascension, Virginia's somnolent pace confused critics into thinking the Cavaliers couldn't score. They could, and quite well, thank you very much -- they just attempted to do so less often than most teams in the matter of 40 minutes. This season's Cavaliers, though, deserve the eyesore rap. The pack-line defense is still the nation's best on a per-possession basis, but against ACC opponents the Cavaliers ranked 11th in points per trip. In late February, they scored 89 points in 120 possessions in two games *combined*. As much as Bennett misses All-American guard Malcolm Brogdon, he might pine for classmate Anthony Gill even more -- the Cavaliers have no post threat, no offensive rebounding and are left prostrate before the fickle whims of whatever cruel Greek deity controls the tightness of orange-painted steel cylinders. The results can be tragic. 14. Purdue Boilermakers Sure, Purdue has its flaws. The Boilermakers finished near the bottom of the Big Ten in offensive rebounding percentage. Their propensity for turnovers -- the Achilles' heel that Arkansas Little Rock exploited in 2016's double-overtime first-round upset -- remains. Their conservative defensive philosophy sacrifices turnovers in order to avoid fouls, which in certain matchups (like Michigan, who beat the Boilers twice in their last four games, comfortable. Purdue also has one of the best long-range rosters in the country surrounding All-American Caleb Swanigan (18.7 points, 12.6 rebounds), who posted 26 double-doubles in 32 games, and who shoots 43 percent from 3 himself. It evens out. 13. Wichita State Shockers Can we be real a second? For just a millisecond? Let down our guard and tell the people how we feel a second? This was written before the bracket was announced. Gasp! We denizens of the past don't yet know where Wichita State was seeded, who they play in the first round, or who was placed in their region. But we can already say these things with confidence: The Shockers are better than their resume, better than their seed, and a waking terror foisted upon whichever No. 1 or No. 2 was unfortunate enough to draw Wichita in a potential second round matchup. Landry Shamet and Conner Frankamp are two of the nation's best 3-point shooters sharing the same backcourt. Wing Markis McDuffie does basically everything well. Only Marquette and Kennesaw State shot it better from deep. Gregg Marshall's teams always guard like crazy. This one is really good. Yet the reasons the Shockers have been inevitably undervalued are not without merit: Every time the MVC champs played three obvious tournament teams (Louisville, Michigan State, Oklahoma State), they lost. Everything is on the table. All contenders are equal, but some are more equal than others. 12. Oregon Ducks With the obvious exception of Michigan (which was literally told to take cover as its airplane skidded off the runway last Wednesday, a tough act to top) no team heard worse news last week than Oregon. Late Friday night, doctors informed Dana Altman that senior forward Chris Boucher had torn his ACL. It was a devastating turn for the sport's most unlikely success story. It also posed new questions about Oregon. No team blocked a higher percentage (17.7) of opponents' attempts this season; the lynchpin in that effort was gone. Could Jordan Bell, already the team's best all-around defender, somehow summon more? Could spot reserve Kavell Bigby-Williams (or, as Bill Walton calls him, ""Bigby"") step in? Meanwhile, the 6-foot-10 Boucher had attempted 101 3s this season, just seven fewer than star guard Dillon Brooks. How would the Ducks' spacing change? How different would its offense look? One game against Arizona in the Pac-12 title isn't enough to know the answers to these questions. We'll find out in the tournament -- and so, it seems, will Oregon. 11. Louisville Cardinals Quiz time. Quick: When did Louisville last fail to show up for the Sweet 16? (No, last season's postseason ban doesn't count.) Ding, ding, ding: 2010. This, not coincidentally, was the last time Rick Pitino didn't preside over one of the nation's most soul-crushing defenses. The Cardinals ranked in the top five in adjusted defensive efficiency every season from 2011 to 2016. They won 17 games in five NCAA tournaments (plus, you know, a national title) in that span. What of these Cardinals, then? Louisville ranks No. 6 defensively per KenPom.com -- all good, right? Look closer: Since Feb. 1, Pitino's team has allowed 1.08 points per trip. Virginia Tech scored 90 in the Yum! Center in mid-February; Wake Forest 88 on the Cards on March 1. Donovan Mitchell is a brilliant high-volume scorer. Pitino is a peerless tactician. But if the Cardinals can't correct this uncharacteristic generosity, and fast, the Sweet 16 might be their ceiling. 10. Baylor Bears Baylor was unranked in the preseason. No, wait -- it gets worse. Not only were the Bears unranked, the AP poll voters didn't pull a single lever in their favor. Not one! Before long, Baylor would reveal itself not just as a top-25 team but one of the sport's best, led by one of its premier two-way players (forward/wing/extraterrestrial Johnathan Motley and powered by one of the stingiest first-shot defenses the Big 12 has seen in years. It seems laughable to think there was a time when Indiana, Connecticut, Syracuse, Texas and Rhode Island were considered better teams than Baylor, but hey, doctors used to swear by bloodletting. Enlightenment's hard. 9. West Virginia Mountaineers You don't need the long version anymore -- how Bob Huggins, after two down years, looked at his undersized roster and decided to make a drastic change. By now, Press Virginia isn't a novelty; it's who the Mountaineers are. And none of Huggins' post-remake teams has been quite as Press Virginia as this one. Not only do Jevon Carter & Co. force more turnovers per possession than any team in college hoops, they force more than any power-conference team in the past 15 years. ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) has been fawning over Huggins' team all season; KenPom.com's adjusted efficiency rankings shares the admiration. You already know West Virginia is good. The Mountaineers are still better than you think. 8. Arizona Wildcats Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey once forbade his front office from likening prospects to NBA players of the same race. Great idea. Comparing players superficially is incredibly pervasive; it is lazy (at best) and misleading (at worst). So instead of saying that Lauri Markkanen -- Arizona's 7-foot European super-frosh who shoots 73 percent at the rim, leads his team in 3-point attempts and accuracy (43.4 percent), and mixes in the occasional unguardable wrong-foot pull-up -- reminds us a lot of Dirk Nowitzki, let's just say Markkanen is the closest thing college basketball has to That Dude. Said dude carried Arizona's offense for months before Wildcats coach Sean Miller got sophomore guard Allonzo Trier back from a PED-related suspension. Now full strength, the Wildcats are a full-blown offensive terror. 7. UCLA Bruins Just now tuning into college basketball? First of all, shame on you. Just kidding. It's totally cool. That said, you did kind of miss out: The 2016-17 UCLA Bruins were one of the most enjoyable nightly experiences this sport has offered up in years. Freshman guard Lonzo Ball -- yes, the kid whose dad (sigh) said he was better than Stephen Curry, and thus set him up for at least one Curry-administered ankle explosion when Ball gets to the NBA next season -- was even better than advertised. Beyond his shooting 72 percent from 2 (!!!) and 41 percent from 3, Ball's passing feel is once-in-a-decade-level stuff. The lights-out group around him (Bryce Alford, Isaac Hamilton, T.J. Leaf, Aaron Holiday, Thomas Welsh) flows in smooth, kinetic unison. The results are regularly spectacular. 6. Duke Blue Devils In 2004, Mike Krzyzewski was offered a five-year, $40 million contract to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. Resisting the NBA sirens proved sage; he has since become the winningest man in Division I hoops history, added two national titles to his total (five), and is likely to be remembered as the greatest college basketball coach of all time. Besides, who needs all that drama ... oh. Real talk: Duke's 2016-17 season has been nothing if not dramatic, to a level that the early-aughts Kobe-Shaq-Phil triumvirate would be proud of. The preseason expectations were imperious. The injuries were debilitating. The Grayson Allen Saga (formal title) was humiliating. Even K himself missed games to undergo and recover from a back surgery. Now, suddenly, they're back in the title conversation. Duke won four straight games and the ACC tournament title in Brooklyn this weekend, knocking off Louisville, North Carolina and Notre Dame along the way. Suddenly, all of the promise of the preseason -- a realized Jayson Tatum, an unguardable Allen-Luke Kennard backcourt combo, interior defense and rebounding that had been missing all year -- came rushing to the fore. But it was also four days. For months, Duke has been ""turning"" various ""corners."" Do you trust them now? This season's most likely national champions. Emphasis on ""most likely."" 5. Kentucky Wildcats In many ways, this Kentucky team is like any other John Calipari-era Kentucky team: The Wildcats are one of the youngest, least experienced teams in the country. They're also one of the best. Precocious star freshmen (De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk, Bam Adebayo) mixed with a holdover sophomore (Isaiah Briscoe), stalwart role-guy vets (Derek Willis, Dominque Hawkins), championship-level defense, championship aspirations. The template. The works. Same as ever. Not quite. This team is unlike any of recent Calipari vintage in one critical sense: It's so bleeping fast. From 2011 to 2016, the Wildcats ranked between 147th and 271st in adjusted tempo (per KenPom.com). This team ranks 16th. The Wildcats average 1.14 points per trip in transition (per Synergy scouting data) -- and they get into transition a lot. This -- not defense -- is best reason to expect these Wildcats to show up in Phoenix in three weeks' time. Kentucky is always young and always good. Rarely is it this much fun. 4. North Carolina Tar Heels Every superhero needs his theme music, and every legendary shot needs its Craig Ehlo: devastated, in disbelief, casting the triumph and joy at the center of the frame into the sharpest possible relief. A year ago, North Carolina was that Ehlo. The Tar Heels suffered one of the toughest losses in college basketball history last March, then waved farewell to heart-and-soul seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson. One year season later, Justin Jackson morphed into the ACC player of the year, Joel Berry admirably stepped in to Paige's shoes, and Kennedy Meeks was the tip of a front line spear that rebounded its misses more often -- and generated more shots -- than any team in college basketball. North Carolina could have faded away. It hasn't lost a step. 3. Kansas Jayhawks Kansas won its 13th-straight Big 12 title this year. If you're of those ""but how many NATIONAL titles have they won, hmmm??"" people, may Bill Self have mercy on your soul. In men's hoops history only the late-1960s/1970s-era UCLA Bruins managed as many consecutive conference crowns, and they did so in a much different, less diffuse, less talent-rich era. (Fun fact: John Wooden wasn't even the coach for all 13. If you're wondering why Bill Self was nominated to the Basketball Hall of Fame this year, well, there you go.) The point is: No matter what happens now, Kansas has accomplished something that even the eventual national champion won't ever come close to matching. It's insane. Frank Mason, Josh Jackson, and the rest of KU's cardiac coterie won't be happy with this season unless it ends with a win. But their achievements to date already occupy such high ground that even a force as powerful as the NCAA tournament won't wash them away. 2. Gonzaga Bulldogs Duke's four-wins-in-four-days Barclays Center bum-rush unleashed a deluge of takes about why the Blue Devils deserved a No. 1 seed. More often than not, that No. 1 seed was Gonzaga's. Really? Going 32-1, beating Arizona, Florida and Iowa State on neutral floors, and punishing a really good Saint Mary's team on three separate occasions (plus, you know, losing once in 33 games) wasn't impressive enough for you? Are you not entertained?! Doubts about Gonzaga in March are one of college basketball's most mystifying memes. Doubts about this Gonzaga team -- which starts multiple high-major recruits, features an All-America point guard in Nigel Williams-Goss and arguably the nation's best center in Przemek Karnowski, brings a first-round draft pick (Zach Collins) off the bench, and plays the best defense of Mark Few's career -- won't suddenly vanish after the first weekend. But if you don't think this team is good enough to win a national title, you just haven't been paying attention. 1. Villanova Wildcats Kris Jenkins is still here, still cranking 3s. Jalen Brunson transformed from a wide-eyed freshman to incredibly canny sophomore in less than a calendar year. Josh Hart, the most anonymous top player on any national title team ever, went from a selective cog to the most important, most efficient player in college basketball. Parts remain. The whole has changed. These Wildcats don't guard quite as well. They don't have a senior point guard like Ryan Arcidiacono, or the post-up fallback plan like Daniel Ochefu. This Villanova team is basketball's future made real: Four guards, sometimes five, moving and swinging and shot-faking and firing and playing every bit as well as the team that triumphed in the greatest national title game of all-time. Before that game, before the world learned how wrong its definition of Villanova had been, we might have asked: Can this type of team win it all? Now we already know the answer.",A full guide to every team in the 2017 NCAA tournament

1197,"It was the third time Heather Pereira had taken her golden retriever to the same neighborhood animal clinic in Kentucky. The first was on a Friday in October 2014, when Pereira took the injured 4-year-old dog to the Elizabethtown Animal Hospital, not far from Louisville. After the veterinarian sewed up a cut, Pereira requested Tramadol, a drug used to treat pain in both animals and humans. She said the pup had been prescribed the medication in the past and had responded well to it, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. So the vet gave it to her. Three days later, she returned — saying her child had flushed the pills down the toilet. So the vet gave her more. But it was this third time, on Dec. 4, 2014, that the veterinarian became suspicions. The dog's old cut had not yet completely healed and the animal was back with another. Again, Pereira asked for Tramadol for the dog. ""That’s when I took notice,"" Chad Bailey, the veterinarian, told The Washington Post in an interview last week. ""The cut looked sharp and clean — not like the kind in nature when a dog is cut on a fence or in a fight."" Police said Pereira had been intentionally wounding her dog and ""vet shopping,"" visiting vet after vet to obtain prescription medication for her pet, then taking it. Although these cases appear uncommon, authorities say they underscore the nation's widespread opioid epidemic, showing the lengths people go to obtain drugs for personal use or for sale on the street. They also say it's a concern — one they want to get ahead of. At the same time, some veterinarians say it's a relatively small problem — arguing that publicizing it will only give drug addicts the idea to do it, and that formally regulating it will only put more of a burden on the vets. ""It’s happening and we are aware of it,"" said Jim Arnold, chief of policy and liaison for the diversion control division at the Drug Enforcement Administration. ""The whole opioid problem in the U.S. has significantly gotten worse, so when you have this kind of situation in the U.S., where people are seeking these kinds of drugs because of the overwhelming addiction problem ... they will find all kinds of ways to obtain these controlled substances."" Opioids are the main drivers of overdose deaths in the United States, accounting for more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The opioid drug problem is big, and it’s not getting any smaller,"" Arnold, with the DEA, told The Post. It is not known how widespread the problem really is because there is no conclusive data tracking cases of vet shopping. But Arnold said drugs such as Ketamine, Tramadol and Valium, which are sometimes prescribed to pets, are used by drug addicts either by themselves or in conjunction with other opioids to enhance the effects. ""It's just another thing,"" he said. ""When you have this kind of addiction, and it has this kind of control over you, people will do just about anything to obtain these drugs, and they usually do."" Police said Pereira, who was 23 in 2014, had first taken her dog to another veterinary clinic for a cut and a Tramadol fix. The third time she showed up to Elizabethtown Animal Hospital, Bailey, the veterinarian, said he thought it was strange. Bailey said he was also concerned that Pereira kept requesting Tramadol, saying that although it is common for owners to ask how to manage their pets' pain, it is not common for them to know the drug names. ""I just said, 'Wait here and I'll take your dog back,' "" he said. Then he walked out of the exam room and called the police. Pereira ultimately admitted to authorities that she had cut her dog with her husband's Micro Touch disposable razor blade three different times to obtain Tramadol, according to court documents. Authorities said she did not have a child, although she had blamed one for flushing the dog's pills, according to the documents. In 2015, Pereira was convicted on three counts of torture of a cat or a dog, as well as five counts of obtaining a controlled substance by making false statements, which is a felony, according to the News-Enterprise. She was sentenced to four years in prison; however, she was released last month to mandatory reentry supervision after serving two years, according to the Kentucky Department of Corrections. Prison officials said Pereira moved out of state but would not disclose her location; she could not be found for comment. Veterinarians no doubt have a hard job as they are reliant on physical examinations, diagnostic testing and pet owners' accounts of  illnesses — and, those in the industry say, people have no doubt taken advantage. In one case mentioned in a 2002 article in the Pharmacy Times, a dog owner reportedly trained his pooch to cough on command while being examined by the vet, so he could get hydrocodone cough medicine. Massachusetts's Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan wrote a letter this month in the Massachusetts Veterinary Medical Association, saying her office is working on a public education campaign to curb it. ""Not long ago, I met a pet owner who said she could not understand why her pet seemed to still be in pain, despite having been prescribed medication,"" she wrote. ""When she realized that a member of her family had been using the pet’s medication, it suddenly became clear why the pet had not been getting better. ""The misuse of pet medication has serious safety implications — for people and for animals. It is hard to find someone whose life hasn’t been affected in some way by the ongoing opioid crisis in our country. We confront this crisis on many fronts and one of our greatest weapons in this fight is information. Educating people about the signs of drug misuse, available treatment resources and how to properly store and dispose of all medications is a crucial part of helping to stem the tide of overdoses and deaths."" Many states have electronic databases known as Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs in which physicians can track controlled prescription drugs that are prescribed to patients. But most do not require veterinarians to report the prescribing and dispensing of these drugs. And some veterinarians argue that forcing them to do so would put an unnecessary burden on them and keep them from focusing on their jobs — caring for the animals. John de Jong, former chairman of the board of directors of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said that although veterinarians ""want to be part of the solution,"" some of them are concerned about overregulation. ""Some veterinarians are going to shy away from prescribing medications because reporting them is costly and time-consuming,"" he said, arguing that some animals may no longer receive the quality care they deserve. De Jong, co-owner of and veterinarian at Newton Animal Hospital in Newton, Mass., said that he has not seen any instances of ""vet shopping"" at his clinic. ""Unless it gets to be a bigger problem, it’s asking a lot,"" he said about reporting the prescription medications.

1198,"Image: Pixabay The US Drug Enforcement Agency has announced that marijuana will remain a Schedule 1 drug, saying it has ""no medical use or purpose."" The decision keeps weed on the same naughty list alongside drugs like LSD and heroin. The Obama Administration has turned down a request by two Democratic governors to change the way marijuana is classified under federal drug control laws. So for the time being, marijuana will continue to be designated a Schedule 1 drug, giving it equal status to LSD and heroin. The DEA said its decision was rooted in science, and that it’s honoring the US Food and Drug Administration’s admonition that marijuana has ""no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States."" The agency added that weed has the potential for ""severe psychological or physical dependence."" ""This decision isn’t based on danger,"" noted DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg. ""This decision is based on whether marijuana, as determined by the FDA, is a safe and effective medicine, and it’s not."" It was hoped that marijuana would be granted Schedule 2 status, which would ease restrictions on research done to uncover the drug’s medical value. That said, the DEA also announced that it will allow more researchers access to marijuana in an effort to encourage further study. ""President Obama always said he would let science—and not ideology—dictate policy,"" noted Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, ""but in this case his administration is upholding a failed drug war approach instead of looking at real, existing evidence that marijuana has medical value."" Indeed, the DEA’s decision is perplexing given just how much research is being done into marijuana and its potential health benefits.

1200,"Page 2 Of 2 It’s not just private residences that have been roped into the game. Many businesses have seen Pokemon Go as an incredible opportunity to draw in customers and have begun dropping lures and offering discounts for the various players who might pass through. Having an influx of people is fundamentally a good thing, but with more people comes a higher risk of injury or claims to be levied on the owners of a business. So, what can they do to protect themselves from the risk of litigation? As King sees it, the laws currently on the books should be more than enough to suffice for now. "" ""People need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings]."" ""I don’t think there’s a lot to think about beyond typical smart practices for running a business,"" he says. ""If you have a ton more people coming through your business, that’s kind of a good problem to have in most cases. But, you still need to do the same things you would do about a smaller volume coming through your business, which is keeping it clean, keeping it safe, [and] ameliorat[ing] any dangerous conditions."" But what about the players themselves? There have been multiple instances of predators planting lures and using them as a way to draw people in, only to rob or assault them once they show up. In case this happens, what can the player do? According to King, it’s not necessarily a difficult thing to avoid. In fact, as we talk to him, he continues to return to one major suggestion: be aware of your surroundings at all times. ""Ultimately, people need to be able to balance [playing and being aware of their surroundings],"" he said. ""They have to be mindful of their surroundings, careful about where they’re going, and that’s true of how you would interact with someone else or chasing a Pokemon."" "" ""I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law."" He also advises anyone who has been the victim of harassment, theft, or assault to not be afraid to take their claim to the police whenever necessary. We often don’t consider how things may need to change in the face of new tech until long after it arrives. Although we have a decent grip on what virtual reality is here in 2016, we’re still very much learning about augmented reality, and how its ability to immediately add context and meaning to real life can lead us into some very interesting territory. How will it affect us, and how will it impact the laws, if at all? ""I would not be surprised to see some changes with administrative law,"" he says, pointing specifically to intellectual property and contributory negligence as being some of the biggest concerns. As for Pokemon Go? It’s mostly fun and games, King says. Sure, there are some concerns that arise alongside of it, but the benefits of hunting adorable made-up creatures in the real world far outweigh the potential negatives. "" Be conscious and courteous of your surroundings. ""The fact that we're getting so many more people out doing things and interacting with public and private property is probably — at least in the margins — increasing the risk of [injuries] and [claims],"" he warns. ""It’s not necessarily a bad thing; it’s good for people to be out in public getting exercise and talking to other people, getting social, and [the handful] of other helpful things we’ve seen out of this game.""

1210,"Soup has seen better days. After decades of sustained growth, the global soup market contracted in 2009, and then again in 2010. While soup sales have since grown, recent growth has been lukewarm at best. In both 2012 and 2013, the market was essentially flat, growing by less than 1%. Eating habits in North America, the world’s biggest soup consumer, are mostly to blame; the region eats over 70% of the world’s canned and preserved soup. The move away from soup is likely tied to a growing consciousness about the downsides to processed and canned foods—the vast majority of soup is canned, preserved, or both. And the can appears to be the least-appreciated part, according to market research group Euromonitor. Not only are cans difficult to open, heavy, and harmful to the environment; they’re also perceived to be not fresh. The success of restaurant chains like Panera and Hale and Hearty are proof that it’s more the container than the soup that’s losing favor. Campbell’s, the world’s largest soup-seller, is clearly concerned. ""You listen to us talk for years about revitalizing the canned soup business that has long been the heart of our enterprise in North America, and you think we’re in denial. The question of the long-term plan for our soup business seems to be a perennial moose on the table,"" the company’s CEO Denise Morrison said in an analyst call in late 2012. Rather than expanding, tweaking, or rebranding its canned offerings, Campbell’s has responded by moving away from its metal container. The company has since launched Campbell’s Go, which it sells in pouches, or bags, and teamed up with K-Cup maker Green Mountain Coffee to expand its soup offerings to single-serving, machine-brewed meals. Revamped soup and non-soup products are the ticket to Campbell’s growth; they’re expected to account for 14% of the company’s sales in 2014.","2012 and 2013, the market was essentially flat, growing by less than 1%."
1211,"From a young age, humans love to press buttons that light up and make a noise. The thrill of positive feedback lies at the heart of addiction to gambling, games, and social media by Adam Alter Not long ago, I stepped into a lift on the 18th floor of a tall building in New York City. A young woman inside the lift was looking down at the top of her toddler’s head with embarrassment as he looked at me and grinned. When I turned to push the ground-floor button, I saw that every button had already been pushed. Kids love pushing buttons, but they only push every button when the buttons light up. From a young age, humans are driven to learn, and learning involves getting as much feedback as possible from the immediate environment. The toddler who shared my elevator was grinning because feedback – in the form of lights or sounds or any change in the state of the world – is pleasurable. But this quest for feedback doesn’t end with childhood. In 2012, an ad agency in Belgium produced an outdoor campaign for a TV channel that quickly went viral. The campaign’s producers placed a big red button on a pedestal in a quaint square in a sleepy town in Flanders. A big arrow hung above the button with a simple instruction: Push to add drama. You can see the glint in each person’s eye as he or she approaches the button – the same glint that came just before the toddler in my elevator raked his tiny hand across the panel of buttons. Psychologists have long tried to understand how animals respond to different forms of feedback. In 1971, a psychologist named Michael Zeiler sat in his lab across from three hungry white carneaux pigeons. At this stage, the research programme focused on rats and pigeons, but it had lofty aims. Could the behaviour of lower-order animals teach governments how to encourage charity and discourage crime? Could entrepreneurs inspire overworked shift workers to find new meaning in their jobs? Could parents learn how to shape perfect children? Before Zeiler could change the world, he had to work out the best way to deliver rewards. One option was to reward every desirable behaviour. Another was to reward those same desirable behaviours on an unpredictable schedule, creating some of the mystery that encourages people to buy lottery tickets. The pigeons had been raised in the lab, so they knew the drill. Each one waddled up to a small button and pecked persistently, hoping that the button would release a tray of Purina pigeon pellets. During some trials, Zeiler would programme the button so it delivered food every time the pigeons pecked; during others, he programmed the button so it delivered food only some of the time. Sometimes the pigeons would peck in vain, the button would turn red, and they would receive nothing. When I first learned about Zeiler’s work, I expected the consistent schedule to work best. But that’s not what happened at all. The results weren’t even close: the pigeons pecked almost twice as often when the reward wasn’t guaranteed. Their brains, it turned out, were releasing far more dopamine when the reward was unexpected than when it was predictable. Zeiler had documented an important fact about positive feedback: that less is often more. His pigeons were drawn to the mystery of mixed feedback just as humans are attracted to the uncertainty of gambling. Decades after Zeiler published his results, in 2012, a team of Facebook web developers prepared to unleash a similar feedback experiment on hundreds of millions of humans. The site already had 200 million users at the time – a number that would triple over the next three years. The experiment took the form of a deceptively simple new feature called a ""like button"". It’s hard to exaggerate how much the like button changed the psychology of Facebook use. What had begun as a passive way to track your friends’ lives was now deeply interactive, and with exactly the sort of unpredictable feedback that motivated Zeiler’s pigeons. Users were gambling every time they shared a photo, web link or status update. A post with zero ""likes"" wasn’t just privately painful, but also a kind of public condemnation: either you didn’t have enough online friends, or, worse still, your online friends weren’t impressed. Like pigeons, we’re more driven to seek feedback when it isn’t guaranteed. Facebook was the first major social networking force to introduce the like button, but others now have similar functions. You can like and repost tweets on Twitter, pictures on Instagram, posts on Google+, columns on LinkedIn, and videos on YouTube. The act of liking became the subject of etiquette debates. What did it mean to refrain from liking a friend’s post? If you liked every third post, was that an implicit condemnation of the other posts? Liking became a form of basic social support – the online equivalent of laughing at a friend’s joke in public. Web developer Rameet Chawla developed an app as a marketing exercise, but also a social experiment, to uncover the effect of the like button. When he launched it, Chawla posted this introduction on its homepage: ""People are addicted. We experience withdrawals. We are so driven by this drug, getting just one hit elicits truly peculiar reactions. I’m talking about likes. They’ve inconspicuously emerged as the first digital drug to dominate our culture."" Chawla’s app, called Lovematically, was designed to automatically like every picture that rolled through its users’ newsfeeds. It wasn’t even necessary to impress them any more; any old post was good enough to inspire a like. Apart from enjoying the warm glow that comes from spreading good cheer, Chawla – for the first three months, the app’s only user – also found that people reciprocated. They liked more of his photos, and he attracted an average of 30 new followers a day, a total of almost 3,000 followers during the trial period. On Valentine’s Day 2014, Chawla allowed 5,000 Instagram users to download a beta version of the app. After only two hours, Instagram shut down Lovematically for violating the social network’s terms of use. ""I knew way before launching it that it would get shut down by Instagram,"" Chawla said. ""Using drug terminology, you know, Instagram is the dealer and I’m the new guy in the market giving away the drug for free."" Chawla was surprised, though, that it happened so quickly. He’d hoped for at least a week of use, but Instagram pounced immediately. When I moved to the United States for postgraduate studies in 2004, online entertainment was limited. These were the days before Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube – and Facebook was limited to students at Harvard. One evening, I stumbled on a game called Sign of the Zodiac (Zodiac for short) that demanded very little mental energy. Zodiac was a simple online slot machine, much like the actual slot machines in casinos: you decided how much to wager, lazily clicked a button over and over again, and watched as the machine spat out wins and losses. At first, I played to relieve the stress of long days filled with too much thinking, but the brief ""ding"" that followed each small win, and the longer melody that followed each major win, hooked me fast. Eventually screenshots of the game would intrude on my day. I’d picture five pink scorpions lining up for the game’s highest jackpot, followed by the jackpot melody that I can still conjure today. I had a minor behavioural addiction, and these were the sensory hangovers of the random, unpredictable feedback that followed each win. My Zodiac addiction wasn’t unusual. For 13 years, Natasha Dow Schüll, a cultural anthropologist, studied gamblers and the machines that hook them. She collected descriptions of slot machines from gambling experts and current and former addicts, which included the following: ""Slots are the crack cocaine of gambling ... electronic morphine ... the most virulent strain of gambling in the history of man ... Slots are the premier addiction delivery device."" These are sensationalised descriptions, but they capture how easily people become hooked on slot-machine gambling. I can relate, because I became addicted to a slots game that wasn’t even doling out real money. The reinforcing sound of a win after the silence of several losses was enough for me. In the US, banks are not allowed to handle online gambling winnings, which makes online gambling practically illegal. Very few companies are willing to fight the system, and the ones that do are quickly defeated. That sounds like a good thing, but free and legal games such as Sign of the Zodiac can also be dangerous. At casinos, the deck is stacked heavily against the player; on average the house has to win. But the house doesn’t have to win in a game without money. As David Goldhill, the chief executive officer of the Game Show Network, which also produces many online games, told me: ""Because we’re not restricted by having to pay real winnings, we can pay out $120 for every $100 played. No land-based casino could do that for more than a week without going out of business."" As a result, the game can continue forever because the player never runs out of chips. I played Sign of the Zodiac for four years and rarely had to start a new game. I won roughly 95% of the time. The game only ended when I had to eat or sleep or attend class in the morning. And sometimes it didn’t even end then. Casinos win most of the time, but they have a clever way of convincing gamblers that the outcomes are reversed. Early slot machines were incredibly simple devices: the player pulled the machine’s arm to spin its three mechanical reels. If the centre of the reels displayed two or more of the same symbol when they stopped spinning, the player won a certain number of coins or credits. Today, slot machines allow gamblers to play multiple lines. Every time you play, you’re more likely to win on at least one line, and the machine will celebrate with you by flashing bright lights and playing catchy tunes. If you play 15 lines, and you win on two of the lines, you make a net loss, and yet you enjoy the positive feedback that follows a win – a type of win that Schüll and other gambling experts call a ""loss disguised as a win"". Losses disguised as wins only matter because players don’t classify them as losses – they classify them as wins. This is what makes modern slot machines – and modern casinos – so dangerous. Like the little boy who hit every button in my lift, adults never really grow out of the thrill of attractive lights and sounds. If our brains convince us that we’re winning even when we’re actually losing, it becomes almost impossible to muster the self-control to stop playing. The success of slot machines is measured by ""time on device"". Since most players lose more money the longer they play, time on device is a useful proxy for profitability. Video-game designers use a similar measure, which captures how engaging and enjoyable their games are. The difference between casinos and video games is that many game designers are more concerned with making their games fun than with making buckets of money. Bennett Foddy, who teaches game design at New York University’s Game Center, has created a number of successful free-to-play games, but each was a labour of love rather than a money-making vehicle. At its peak in 2013, Candy Crush Saga generated more than $600,000 in revenue per day ""Video games are governed by microscopic rules,"" Foddy says. ""When your mouse cursor moves over a particular box, text will pop up, or a sound will play. Designers use this sort of micro-feedback to keep players more engaged and more hooked in."" A game must obey these microscopic rules, because gamers are likely to stop playing a game that doesn’t deliver a steady dose of small rewards that make sense given the game’s rules. Those rewards can be as subtle as a ""ding"" sound or a white flash whenever a character moves over a particular square. ""Those bits of micro-feedback need to follow the act almost immediately, because if there’s a tight pairing in time between when I act and when something happens, then I’ll think I was causing it."" The game Candy Crush Saga is a prime example. At its peak in 2013, the game generated more than $600,000 in revenue per day. To date, its developer, King, has earned around $2.5 billion from the game. Somewhere between half a billion and a billion people have downloaded Candy Crush Saga on their smartphones or through Facebook. Most of those players are women, which is unusual for a blockbuster. It’s hard to understand the game’s colossal success when you see how straightforward it is. Players aim to create lines of three or more of the same candy by swiping candies left, right, up, and down. Candies are ""crushed"" – they disappear – when you form these matching lines, and the candies above them drop down to take their place. The game ends when the screen fills with candies that cannot be matched. Foddy told me that it wasn’t the rules that made the game a success – it was juice. Juice refers to the game’s surface feedback. It isn’t essential to the game, but it’s essential to the game’s success. Without juice, the game loses its charm. ""Novice game designers often forget to add juice,"" Foddy said. ""If a character in your game runs through the grass, the grass should bend as he runs through it. It tells you that the grass is real and that the character and grass are in the same world."" When you form a line in Candy Crush Saga, a reinforcing sound plays, the score associated with that line flashes brightly, and sometimes you hear words of praise intoned by a hidden, deep-voiced narrator. Juice amplifies feedback, but it’s also designed to unite the real world and the gaming world. The most powerful vehicle for juice must surely be virtual reality (VR) technology, which is still in its infancy. VR places the user in an immersive environment, which the user navigates as she might the real world. Advanced VR also introduces multisensory feedback, including touch, hearing and smell. In a podcast last year, the author and sports columnist Bill Simmons spoke to billionaire investor Chris Sacca, an early Google employee and Twitter investor, about his experience with VR. ""I’m afraid for my kids, a little bit,"" Simmons said. ""I do wonder if this VR world you dive into is almost superior to the actual world you’re in. Instead of having human interactions, I can just go into this VR world and do VR things and that’s gonna be my life."" Sacca shared Simmons’ concerns. ""One of the things that’s interesting about technology is that the improvement in resolution and sound modelling and responsiveness is outpacing our own physiological development,"" Sacca said. ""You can watch some early videos ... where you are on top of a skyscraper, and your body will not let you step forward. Your body is convinced that that is the side of the skyscraper. That’s not even a super immersive VR platform. So we have some crazy days ahead of us."" I worry what happens when a violent video game feels like murder. And when pornography feels like sex Until recently, most people thought of VR as a tool for gaming, but that changed when Facebook acquired Oculus VR for $2bn in 2014. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg had big ideas for the Oculus Rift gaming headset that went far beyond games. ""This is just the start,"" Zuckerberg said. ""After games, we’re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court-side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face – just by putting goggles in your home."" VR no longer dwelled on the fringes. ""One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people,"" said Zuckerberg. In October 2015, the New York Times shipped a small cardboard VR viewer with its Sunday paper. Paired with a smartphone, the Google Cardboard viewer streamed VR content, including documentaries on North Korea, Syrian refugees, and a vigil following the Paris terror attacks. ""Instead of sitting through 45 seconds on the news of someone walking around and explaining how terrible it is, you are actively becoming a participant in the story that you are viewing,"" said Christian Stephen, a producer of one of the VR documentaries. Despite the promise of VR, it also poses great risks. Jeremy Bailenson, a professor of communication at Stanford’s Virtual Reality Interaction Lab, worries that the Oculus Rift will damage how people interact with the world. ""Am I terrified of the world where anyone can create really horrible experiences? Yes, it does worry me. I worry what happens when a violent video game feels like murder. And when pornography feels like sex. How does that change the way humans interact, function as a society?"" When it matures, VR will allow us to spend time with anyone in any location doing whatever we like for as long as we like. That sort of boundless pleasure sounds wonderful, but it has the capacity to devalue face-to-face interactions. Why live in the real world with real, flawed people when you can live in a perfect world that feels just as real? Wielded by game designers, it might prove to be a vehicle for the latest in a series of escalating behavioural addictions. Some experiences are designed to be addictive for the sake of ensnaring hapless consumers, but others happen to be addictive though they are primarily designed to be fun or engaging. The line that separates these is very thin; to a large extent the difference rests on the intention of the designer. When Nintendo’s superstar game designer Shigeru Miyamoto created Super Mario Bros, his primary aim was to make a game that he himself enjoyed playing. ""That’s the point,"" he said, ""not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It’s the very core feeling we should have in making games."" When you compare Super Mario Bros – regularly voted by game designers as one of the greatest games ever – to others on the market, it is easy to recognise the difference in intention. Adam Saltsman, who produced an acclaimed indie game called Canabalt in 2009, has written extensively about the ethics of game design. ""Many of the predatory games of the past five years use what’s known as an energy system,"" Saltsman said. ""You’re allowed to play the game for five minutes, and then you artificially run out of stuff to do. The game will send you an email in, say, four hours when you can start playing again."" I told Saltsman that the system sounded pretty good to me – it forces gamers to take breaks and encourages kids to do their homework between gaming sessions. But that’s where the predatory part comes in. According to Saltsman: ""Game designers began to realise that players would pay $1 to shorten the wait time, or to increase the amount of energy their avatar would have once the four-hour rest period had passed."" I came across this predatory device when playing a game called Trivia Crack. If you give the wrong answer several times, you run out of lives, and a dialogue screen gives you a choice: wait for an hour for more lives, or pay 99 cents to continue immediately. Many games hide these down-the-line charges. They’re free, at first, but later you are forced to pay in-game fees to continue. If you are minutes or even hours deep into the game, the last thing you want to do is admit defeat. You have so much to lose, and your aversion to that sense of loss compels you to feed the machine just one more time, over and over again. You start playing because you want to have fun, but you continue playing because you want to avoid feeling unhappy. A game in which you always win is boring. It sounds appealing but it gets old fast. To some extent we all need losses and difficulties and challenges, because without them the thrill of success weakens gradually with each new victory. The hardship of the challenge is far more compelling than knowing you are going to succeed. This sense of hardship is an ingredient in many addictive experiences, including one of the most addictive games of all time: Tetris. In 1984, Alexey Pajitnov was working at a computer lab at the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. Many of the lab’s scientists worked on side projects, and Pajitnov began working on a video game. Pajitnov worked on Tetris for much longer than he planned because he couldn’t stop playing the game. Eventually Pajitnov allowed his friends at the Academy of Science to play the game. ""Everyone who touched the game couldn’t stop playing either."" His best friend, Vladimir Pokhilko, a former psychologist, remembered taking the game to his lab at the Moscow Medical Institute. ""Everybody stopped working. So I deleted it from every computer. Everyone went back to work, until a new version appeared in the lab."" Tetris spread from the Academy of Science to the rest of Moscow, and then on to the rest of Russia and eastern Europe. Two years later, in 1986, the game reached the west, but its big break came in 1991, when Nintendo signed a deal with Pajitnov. Every Game Boy would come with a free game cartridge that contained a redesigned version of Tetris. That year I saved up and ultimately bought a Game Boy, which is how I came to play Tetris for the first time. It wasn’t as glitzy as some of my other favourites, but I played for hours at a time. Nintendo was smart to include the game with their new portable console, because it was easy to learn and very difficult to abandon. I assumed that I would grow tired of Tetris, but sometimes I still play the game today, more than 25 years later. It has longevity because it grows with you. It’s easy at first, but as your skills improve, the game gets more difficult. The pieces fall from the top of the screen more quickly, and you have less time to react than you did when you were a novice. This escalation of difficulty is a critical hook that keeps the game engaging long after you have mastered its basic moves. Twenty-five years ago, a psychiatrist named Richard Haier showed that this progression is pleasurable because your brain becomes more efficient as you improve. Haier decided to watch as people mastered a video game, though he knew little about the cutting-edge world of gaming. ""In 1991 no one had heard of Tetris,"" he said in an interview a few years later. ""I went to the computer store to see what they had and the guy said, ‘Here try this. It’s just come in.’ Tetris was the perfect game, it was simple to learn, you had to practise to get good, and there was a good learning curve."" Haier bought some copies of Tetris for his lab and watched as his experimental subjects played the game. He did find neurological changes with experience – parts of the brain thickened and brain activity declined, suggesting experts’ brains worked more efficiently – but more relevant here, he found that his subjects relished playing the game. They signed up to play for 45 minutes a day, five days a week, for up to eight weeks. They came for the experiment (and the cash payment that came with participating), but stayed for the game. Many behavioural addictions are quietly destructive acts wrapped in cloaks of creation One satisfying feature of the game is the sense that you are building something – your efforts produce a pleasing tower of coloured bricks. You have the chaos coming as random pieces, and your job is to put them in order. The game allows you the brief thrill of seeing your completed lines flash before they disappear, leaving only your mistakes. So you begin again, and try to complete another line as the game speeds up and your fingers are forced to dance across the controls more quickly. Mikhail Kulagin, Pajitnov’s friend and a fellow programmer, remembers feeling a drive to fix his mistakes. ""Tetris is a game with a very strong negative motivation. You never see what you have done very well, and your mistakes are seen on the screen. You always want to correct them."" The sense of creating something that requires labour and effort and expertise is a major force behind addictive acts that might otherwise lose their sheen over time. It also highlights an insidious difference between substance addiction and behavioural addiction: where substance addictions are nakedly destructive, many behavioural addictions are quietly destructive acts wrapped in cloaks of creation. The illusion of progress will sustain you as you achieve high scores or acquire more followers or improve your skills, and so, if you want to stop, you’ll struggle ever harder against the drive to grow.

1213,"Justice Hillary Clinton Isn’t Getting Indicted. Here’s Why. by by Ian Millhiser Jul 5, 2016 11:15 am CREDIT: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Tuesday morning, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency’s investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s handling of a private email server while she was Secretary of State has come to a close. He also added that the FBI will recommend against criminal charges for Secretary Clinton, stating that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" could determine that charges were warranted here. It’s an announcement that will surprise no one who is familiar with the underlying law and ordinary Justice Department practices in a case such as this one. Nevertheless, in part because calls for a Clinton indictment were Nevertheless, in part because calls for a Clinton indictment were amplified by Republicans at the highest levels , and in part because of what Josh Marshall described as the media-industrial complex’s quest for "" wingnut page views ,"" the idea that Clinton may face criminal charges has lingered for months. Here’s what you need to know about why such charges were never a realistic possibility. Clinton, Clinton, like her two most recent predecessors Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, maintained at least two email accounts: one specifically set up to receive classified information and the other for other communications. Clinton’s non-classified email was hosted on a private server (as opposed to Powell’s non-classified email address, which was an AOL account ), while the classified email could only be accessed if Clinton complied with a byzantine array of security rules. Clinton says that the emails she received at her non-classified address "" Clinton says that the emails she received at her non-classified address "" were not marked classified ,"" although she acknowledges that ""there are disagreements among agencies on what should have been perhaps classified retroactively."" Government officials also confirm that ""none of the emails the State Department redacted, or any other emails made public, contained classification markings at the time they were sent."" Although the FBI determined that 110 emails did contain classified information. This matters because of a legal concept called mens rea . As a general rule, most crimes require prosecutors to prove that an individual acted with a particular state of mind before they can be convicted of a specific crime. Most federal laws dealing with classified information require someone to ""knowingly"" violate that law in order to sustain a conviction. Thus, Clinton cannot be charged with transmitting or receiving classified information based on that fact alone. She had to have acted with knowledge that specific information was classified when it was transmitted. There is little, if any, evidence that Clinton possessed this state of mind. This matters because of a legal concept called.

Thus, Clinton cannot be charged with transmitting or receiving classified information based on that fact alone. She had to have acted with knowledge that specific information was classified when it was transmitted. There is little, if any, evidence that Clinton possessed this state of mind. There is, however, mens rea other than knowledge in order to sustain a conviction. Under this provision, There is, however, one law which does require amens reaother than knowledge in order to sustain a conviction. Under this provision, Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, (1) through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer—Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. Yet, as ABC News Legal Analyst Dan Abrams explains, several key words in this provision also weigh against charging Clinton. For one thing, a Yet, as ABC News Legal Analyst Dan Abrams explains, several key words in this provision also weigh against charging Clinton. For one thing, a 1941 Supreme Court decision interprets the phrase ""relating to the national defense"" to require ""‘intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign nation.’ This requires those prosecuted to have acted in bad faith."" That’s a high bar — there’s no apparent evidence that Clinton had reason to believe that her use of a private server would cause information to be obtained that advantaged a foreign nation or that would have caused injury to the United States. Additionally, the phrase ""gross negligence"" also requires prosecutors to clear a high bar — ""a lack of care that demonstrates reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, which is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people’s rights to safety."" Indeed, as Comey noted in his announcement, the FBI could not ""find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts"" as ""all the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an interference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice."" ""We do not see those things here,"" he added. Setting aside the bare language of the law, there’s also a very important practical reason why officials in Clinton’s position are not typically indicted. The security applied to classified email systems is Setting aside the bare language of the law, there’s also a very important practical reason why officials in Clinton’s position are not typically indicted. The security applied to classified email systems is simply absurd . For this reason, a former CIA general counsel told the Washington Post’s David Ignatius, ""’it’s common’ that people end up using unclassified systems to transmit classified information."" ""’It’s inevitable, because the classified systems are often cumbersome and lots of people have access to the classified e-mails or cables.’ People who need quick guidance about a sensitive matter often pick up the phone or send a message on an open system. They shouldn’t, but they do."" Indicting Clinton would require the Justice Department to apply a legal standard that would endanger countless officials throughout the government, and that would make it impossible for many government offices to function effectively.","Indicting Clinton would require the Justice Department to apply a legal standard that would endanger countless officials throughout the government, and that would make it impossible for many government offices to function effectively."
1217,"LOS ANGELES — Casey Affleck's performance in Manchester by the Sea was one of two tickets to the Oscars Best Actor race stamped at Sundance, the other being Nate Parker's for The Birth of a Nation. Surely poised to hit new career heights, the Park City breakouts harbored another similarity: Each had past allegations of sexual misconduct hiding in plain sight. Discussion of rape allegations against Parker have already effectively taken him out of Oscar contention; he's now spoken at great length about the case. But Affleck has sailed through so far without mention of the two women, a producer and a cinematographer, who in separate 2010 lawsuits accused him of boorish and harassing behavior — including unwelcome physical advances — while shooting the Joaquin Phoenix docu-farce I'm Still Here. Those cases, which sought more than $2 million each, were characterized as extortion attempts by Affleck's lawyer and settled out of court. Affleck declined through his publicist to speak with Mashable about the allegations, which were reported in the tabloid and trade press when they were filed just over six years ago. Now, with an Oscar nomination at stake for both actors, Parker is being routinely grilled, something he can expect to continue as Fox Searchlight rolls toward the Oct. 7 release of The Birth of a Nation, including a full junket and press conference scheduled for the Toronto Film Festival. Meanwhile, Affleck was just ""feted"" at the Telluride Film Festival, where he received a special tribute and gave multiple interviews tied to Manchester screenings that solidified his position as a Best Actor in the making. He was never asked about the allegations, or how they might be perceived vis a vis Parker. Nate Parker’s history is reigniting the conflict between art and artist, and whether they should or can be separate. But the equation has a similar calculus when applied to Affleck's performance in Manchester by the Sea. Both actors were accused of behavior toward women that was sexual in nature, legally actionable in stature and not widely discussed or contemplated when first reported. But at the time, neither was a potential Best Actor nominee. Now, the spotlight shines brighter, and with it comes a fresh round of scrutiny. Their cases have fundamental differences, of course. Parker's was a criminal matter, while Affleck's was civil. Back in 1999, a 19-year-old Parker and eventual Nation co-story writer Jean Celestin were accused of raping a fellow Penn State student when she was unconscious and unable to consent. Parker was acquitted and Celestin's conviction was later vacated. Affleck, still best known as the younger brother of Ben, was in his mid-30s and already supporting-actor nominated for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford when he was accused of repeatedly sexually harassing and berating two female colleagues during the 2009 production. One of the women accused Affleck of sneaking into her bed while she slept, then startling her awake in what was described in court papers as an unwelcome sexual advance. That case was filed by Magdalena Górka, an experienced Polish cinematographer who, according to court documents filed in Los Angeles and obtained by Mashable, agreed in December 2008 to shoot I'm Still Here, the freewheeling (and later revealed as phony) documentary about Phoenix's transition from actor to rapper. The project attracted the most attention for Phoenix's odd, disheveled public behavior during production, including that infamous appearance on Late Night With David Letterman. What was going on behind the scenes, according to the lawsuits, was more unsettling. Górka, the only woman on the crew, alleges the lewd comments began almost immediately and continued daily, including sexual advances and suggestions that she sleep with her camera assistant, Antony Langdon — one of Affleck's good buddies and the guitarist for the British/American rock band Spacehog — who was hired as part of the crew. (Langdon did not respond to requests for comment.) Tensions boiled over during filming in New York; Górka says the crew was lodged in Affleck's apartment, where he offered to take the couch so she could use his bedroom. She says she put on a camisole and pajama pants and went to sleep, and that at some point Affleck snuck in and curled up next to her in the middle of the night. Gorka said she didn't know how long Affleck, who she claims reeked of alcohol, had been there. From the complaint: Affleck had his arm around her and was caressing her back and his face was right next to hers. ... Plaintiff was shocked and repulsed because she did not know where he had touched her while she was sleeping. ... [Górka] immediately jumped up and told Affleck to get out of her bed. Affleck responded by asking ""Why?"" Plaintiff said ""Because you are married and because you are my boss."" Affleck, undeterred, asked if Plaintiff ""was sure."" Plaintiff said she was sure and insisted that he leave the room. Affleck left and slammed the door in anger. Affleck was married at the time to Summer Phoenix (the sister of Joaquin), though the couple separated earlier this year. Read the entirety of Górka's lawsuit here: Though Górka confronted Affleck the next morning and left the project, she was convinced weeks later to return by Amanda White, a producer on I'm Still Here, according to the documents. Assured that White would be present during production and hopeful that another woman on set would tamp down the harassment, Górka came back. But the hostile environment persisted, she says, including a night in Costa Rica when Affleck and Phoenix locked themselves inside the women's shared room. Crew members told them the brothers-in-law were in there having sex with two other women, despite the fact that they had their own rooms, the documents claim. Górka's stories were corroborated by White — the producer who'd convinced her to return, and who had known Affleck for more a decade — in a lawsuit White filed just days before Górka's. Besides recounting Górka's allegations, White says Affleck harassed her, too. According to White's suit, Affleck ordered Górka's camera assistant Langdon (above) to show her his genitals on a plane, which he did despite her protests; tried to manipulate White into staying in his hotel room on location in San Francisco and when she refused, ""violently"" grabbed her arm; and later berated and intimidated White and Górka during a meeting at his home, where he ""grew livid with [White] when she refused to succumb to his intimidation tactics."" She also describes a Las Vegas shoot that Affleck set up with several prostitutes crowded into a hotel room — a scene that White says never made the movie because it was set up solely for the director's ""personal gratification."" But a good chunk of White's tale involved watching what Górka had to endure, allegedly at the hands of Affleck and Langdon, according to the documents, which claim: During the course of production, Langdon also made repeated sexual advances towards Gorka in the presence of [White], Affleck and Phoenix. Gorka was harassed by Langdon on an almost daily basis. Langdon routinely referred to the size of his penis; asked Gorka out on dates; and discussed sexually explicit conduct. ... Although Landgdon's advances were unsolicited and Gorka complained about the work environment, she was forced to continue working directly with Langdon. Read the entirety of White's lawsuit here: Martin Singer, bulldog attorney to the stars who represented Affleck in both cases, filed a lengthy motion July 27, 2010, just days after White's lawsuit and before Górka's, to compel the matter into arbitration. But more than seeking an out-of-court venue, the filing implied that White had ""concocted this fabricated sexual harassment lawsuit over a year after she failed in her devious attempt [to] extort a better production deal."" The motion, obtained by Mashable, included references to emails between White and Affleck that were friendly and professional in nature — not an unusual dynamic in cases of abuse — including well-wishes and thank-yous apparently sent after she had left I'm Still Here. It also said the attorney who filed White's lawsuit, Brian Procel, tried to renegotiate her deal months before any accusations of harassment flew. Read the entire response here: The motion was never granted, nor would it need to be. Six weeks later, among the hype and confusion that surrounded the release of I'm Still Here (which Affleck and Phoenix were still stubbornly insisting was a real documentary, though few believed them), the Los Angeles Times published a long story about Phoenix, the actor, possibly coming out of his bizarre ""retirement."" Buried deep within the item was an update on the harassment cases: Affleck had settled with White and Górka. A joint statement from both sides read simply: The disputes between Flemmy Productions, LLC and Casey Affleck with Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka in connection with the film 'I'm Still Here' have been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. A few weeks later, on October 4, 2010, both Górka and White separately filed requests that their lawsuits be dismissed. The amount of money exchanged in the settlements, if any, was not disclosed, and the matter was ended. If Affleck indeed paid Górka and White, whatever they recovered likely came with ironclad legal guarantees that they never speak to anyone about the case. Each is still listed in the I'm Still Here credits; neither responded to Mashable's request for comment. White has moved on to television specials, while Górka immediately shifted to Paranormal Activity 3, and has shot several smaller-scale feature films since, the most recent being An Ordinary Man, a 2017 war-crimes drama starring Peter Serafinowicz and Ben Kingsley. But there's no telling what real impact the lawsuit has had on her Hollywood trajectory. Górka's original filing took the unusual step of pointing out that she was a first-time accuser and was concerned about damage to her reputation that speaking out might inflict: During her 16 years working in the entertainment industry, [Górka] has never accused anyone of sexual harassment. She has never filed a lawsuit against anyone for any reason. And she has struggled with her decision to file this lawsuit — she is justifiably concerned about the effect this lawsuit will have on her career. She notes that the experience, after 16 years of working with top directors and cinematographers, was ""the most traumatizing of her career"" — suggesting that the on-set harassment of women is hardly isolated to what you read in court filings. Now the matter goes to the court of the Film Academy's voters, most of whom have spent their fair share of time on movie sets. But in the wake of Nate Parker, they may also be less inclined to separate the art from the artist.","But Affleck has sailed through so far without mention of the two women, a producer and a cinematographer, who in separate 2010 lawsuits accused him of boorish and harassing behavior — including unwelcome physical advances — while shooting the Joaquin Phoenix docu-farce I'm Still Here."
1219,"Marijuana's official designation as a Schedule 1 drug – something with ""no accepted medical use"" – means it is pretty tough to study. Yet numerous anecdotal reports, as well as some studies, have linked marijuana with several purported health benefits, from pain relief to helping with certain forms of epilepsy. Still, experts say more rigorous scientific analyses are needed. Use of marijuana, a psychoactive drug, can come with risks, especially in people who may be prone to addiction or mental illness. And now, for the first time, researchers have found a link between daily decade-long weed use and a difference in how the brain processes reward. For years, researchers have suggested that such a link exists – and if it does, that it could play a powerful role in addiction. An important part of this line of thought is that addicts, far from amoral individuals incapable of making intelligent decisions, simply respond differently to drugs – neurologically, psychologically, physiologically – than people who are not addicted. And this response is probably the result of many factors outside the person's control, including genetics, behaviour, and environment. So for their study, published on Wednesday in the journal Human Brain Mapping, researchers at the Centre for BrainHealth at the University of Texas, Dallas, took a look at the brains of 53 daily long-term pot users (14 of whom met the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for addiction) and 68 people who'd never used the drug daily. Then the researchers showed them a series of objects meant to test their reward response. The objects included one type of fruit (the ""natural cue""), a pencil (the ""neutral cue""), and either a bong, a pipe, or a joint (the ""cannabis cue""), depending on which one the participant said they preferred. Importantly, this study did not look at so-called recreational users – those who use the drug every few weeks or months. Instead, it focused on people who used the drug every day for an average of 12 years, several of whom met the criteria for being addicted to the drug, and many of whom displayed some signs of past or present problems with weed. Why? Because the researchers wanted to tease out how changes to the brain's reward pathway might affect those who used the drug every day for years – and, more importantly, why. Not surprisingly, when the chronic users were presented with either the bong, pipe, or joint, they displayed a stronger response in several parts of their brain linked with reward than they did when they were shown the fruit cues. In contrast, the non-users did not show a significantly greater response to either the weed or fruit cues, and some parts of their brains showed a greater response to the fruit than to the bong, pipe, or joint. ""We found that marijuana disrupts the brain's natural reward circuitry, making marijuana highly salient to heavy users,"" Francesca Filbey, the director of cognitive neuroscience research of addictive disorders at the Centre for BrainHealth and an associate professor in the School of Behavioural and Brain Sciences, told Business Insider. ""In essence, these brain alterations could be a marker of transition from recreational marijuana use to problematic use,"" she said. The orbitofrontal cortex, highlighted in green. Marijuana and the brain In another 2014 study also by Filbey, she and her team found that, compared with people who didn't use pot, long-term, heavy users tended to have a smaller orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region critical for processing emotions and making decisions. And, interestingly enough, the heavy users also appeared to have more cross-brain connections. Scientists think regular users may develop these links as a means of compensating for the difference in size. The regular pot users also had lower IQ scores overall when compared with the people who didn't use the drug. To arrive at their results – one of the first comprehensive, 3D pictures of the brains of adults who'd smoked weed at least four times a week, often multiple times a day, for years – the researchers used a combination of MRI-based brain scans. Still, that study did not show that chronic weed use caused certain regions of the brain to shrink, or that pot use caused lower IQ scores – it simply showed a relationship among those factors. ""We cannot honestly say that that is what's happening here,"" Filbey told Business Insider in 2014. Similarly, the latest study does not show that chronic pot use causes a change in the brain's reward response; the reverse could also be true, that the changed reward response influenced the chronic pot use.","marijuana disrupts the brain's natural reward circuitry, making marijuana highly salient to heavy users,"
1221,"What Causes Diabetes? Scientists don’t know exactly what causes diabetes. They think that type 1 diabetes is a disease in which your immune system attacks your own cells as if they were foreign invaders. This is called an autoimmune disease. In type 1 diabetes, your immune system attacks your pancreas cells and destroys their ability to make insulin. Most scientists believe that an environmental factor, such as a virus, triggers this process in your body. Your genes play a role as well. Certain people are more prone to develop diabetes. Likewise, health experts don’t fully understand what causes type 2 diabetes. They do know that it is closely linked to obesity and it tends to run in families. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes but you can prevent it in many cases. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to reverse or control high blood sugar through diet and exercise. However, you will always have diabetes and you will always need to manage it to prevent serious health problems. Is There a Cure for Diabetes? Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are chronic, lifelong conditions. Currently, there is no permanent cure for either type. However, there is hope in research for a cure and in prevention. While you can’t prevent type 1 diabetes, you may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly are all ways you can help prevent type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that diabetes affects 25.8 million people in the United States (Source: CDC ). Because it is such a big health issue, there’s a lot of research looking at how to cure diabetes. Research focuses on the autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes, genetic factors, and how to make new pancreas cells. What Is the Current Research? Scientists are conducting cutting-edge research into finding a cure. Current research includes: Artificial pancreas. This partially automated system uses a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump to deliver insulin doses based on your blood sugar readings. A computer coordinates the monitor and the pump. Someday, researchers hope to develop a fully automated system that would work just like your pancreas. Genetic manipulation, or transforming cells that usually don’t make insulin into ones that do Islet cell transplantation. Islet cells are clusters of cells in your pancreas. Within the clusters are beta cells that make insulin. Islet cell transplantation takes cells from an organ donor and puts them in your pancreas. Pancreas transplantation takes an entire pancreas from an organ donor or part of a pancreas from a live person and puts it in your body. Resetting the immune system by inactivating it and transplanting new immune system cells Programming stem cells so that they can make insulin Vaccines to prevent your immune system from attacking the cells that make insulin While these therapies are in the beginning stages of research and development, in the future they may act as stepping stones along the path for helping people with type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is unique because your body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin. Researchers need to fully understand insulin resistance before these approaches can help with type 2 diabetes.","Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are chronic, lifelong conditions. Currently, there is no permanent cure for either type. However, there is hope in research for a cure and in prevention.

1225,"Tax breaks for charitable giving are sometimes the gentle nudge our generosity needs. When we make donations to worthy causes before the end of the year, it's an all-around win : In addition to keeping more of our own money, we help people who need it most, we sometimes lessen the burden on public coffers, and we can even improve our own health when we give. But before you become the go-to person with a wallet as wide open as your heart, consider having a strategy so that your donated dollars do the most good. Kay McFarlin, president at TIAA Charitable, says that because we're all different, there's no one size-fits all approach when it comes to giving, and it helps to consult with a financial professional if you're at all confused. It's also important for individuals to hone in on the charities and causes they want to focus on. There are millions of great charities in the United States, which can be a bit overwhelming, she said. She also advised looking into Donor Advised Funds (DAFs), sort of like charitable savings accounts, which allow you to write one check that will be distributed to many organizations upon your recommendation while your un-donated money grows. But do your homework before signing up, and make sure the institution you choose is doing what they promise. Maria The Money Scientist James, a personal finance expert, agrees that DAFs are a good choice if you're making sizable donations of several thousand dollars or more. It depends on the institution where the person opens the fund, but it will be thousands of dollars. For example Fidelity Charitable requires an initial deposit of $5,000 to start a DAF. However, The T. Rowe Price Program for Charitable Giving requires a minimum initial deposit of $10,000 in order to set up a DAF, she said. The DAF will allow you to get the tax breaks immediately as you set aside the planned charitable donation and gives you time to decide on a non-profit, James said. She added that there's another consideration, though, and that's to understand how urgently the nonprofit needs your donation. Even if they are partnered with a DAF, they may not see the money for a while, she said. There isn't a strict time requirement on donating the money so an owner of a DAF could wait a couple years before giving out any donations. Therefore, a non-profit could actually end up with less money as the DAF owners wait to actually distribute the money. McFarlin also said to remember the benefits from giving away things other than money. Rather than throwing away furniture, clothes and equipment you aren't using, look into donate them to charity since non-cash gifts might also qualify for tax deductions. And if your non-cash gifts include appreciated securities and complex assets, giving through a DAF can simplify the process as most large DAFs are set up to accept these types of contributions, she said. Sometimes we find a family or individual that can use our help. By all means do what you can to make an impact, but understand that giving directly to someone without the umbrella of a qualifying non-profit organization will not help your tax situation. While giving to individuals is certainly generous and well-intended, you are only eligible for tax deductions if you give to qualified recipients. So, from a tax benefit perspective, giving to a charitable organization is a better option, McFarlin said. If you aren't sure if the organization you have in mind is eligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions, ask the charity directly or the IRS can inform you of their tax status. Look for IRS recognized charities eligible to receive tax-exempt contributions. Want to give but don't know where? Charity Navigator has a tool to help individuals narrow down the search. And if you're interested in giving (or getting) a charitable donation as a gift in someone's name, try Small Token, where you can create and donate to charitable gift registries for no fee. You can also give a lump sum to an organization such as United Way, which distributes grants to a variety of programs.","So, from a tax benefit perspective, giving to a charitable organization is a better option,"
1226,"When a road accident occurs, bystanders will usually try to help the injured, or at least call for help. In India it's different. In a country with some of the world's most dangerous roads, victims are all too often left to fend for themselves. Kanhaiya Lal desperately cries for help but motorists swerve straight past him. His young son and the splayed bodies of his wife and infant daughter lie next to the mangled motorbike on which they had all been travelling seconds earlier. The widely broadcast CCTV footage of this scene - showing the suffering of a family of hit-and-run victims in northern India in 2013 and the apparent indifference of passers-by - troubled many Indians. Some motorcyclists and police eventually came to the family's aid but it was too late for Lal's wife and daughter. Their deaths sparked a nationwide debate over the role of bystanders - the media hailed it as a ""new low in public apathy"" and worse, ""the day humanity died"". But what safety campaigner Piyush Tewari saw wasn't a lack of compassion but an entire system stacked against helping road victims. His work to change this began nearly 10 years ago, when his 17-year-old cousin was knocked down on the way home from school. ""A lot of people stopped but nobody came forward to help,"" Tewari says. ""He bled to death on the side of the road."" Tewari set out to understand this behaviour, and found the same pattern repeated time and again across the country. Passers-by who could have helped were holding back and doing nothing. ""The foremost reason was intimidation by police,"" he says. ""Oftentimes if you assist someone the police will assume you're helping that person out of guilt."" The discovery spurred Tewari to set up SaveLIFE. In a 2013 survey, the foundation found that 74% of Indians were unlikely to help an accident victim, whether alone or with other bystanders. Apart from the fear of being falsely implicated, people also worried about becoming trapped as a witness in a court case - legal proceedings can be notoriously protracted in India. And if they helped the victim get to hospital, they feared coming under pressure to stump up fees for medical treatment. In a country with smoothly functioning emergency services, bystanders often need to do little more than call an ambulance, do their best to provide first aid and reassure victims that help is on the way. But in India ambulances are in short supply, sometimes very slow to arrive and often poorly equipped. This makes it a country in need of Good Samaritans - and according to Tewari there are many Good Samaritans out there. They just choose carefully when to leap into action. He contrasts the reluctance of passers-by to help victims of road accidents with their response to train crashes or bombs blasts. In these cases, he says, ""before the police or media arrives everybody's been moved to hospital"". The big difference with road accidents is that there are usually just one or two victims. ""The chances of getting blamed are much higher,"" he says. SaveLIFE filed a case with India's top court to introduce legal protection for Indian bystanders and a year ago there was a breakthrough when the Supreme Court issued a number of guidelines, including: allowing people who call to alert emergency services about a crash to remain anonymous providing them with immunity from criminal liability forbidding hospitals from demanding payment from a bystander who takes an injured person to hospital Just two months later, though, another hit-and-run incident caught on camera shocked the nation. ""See how they're just watching?"" murmurs Anita Jindal as she scans the CCTV footage, once again, on her mobile phone in the cramped room-cum-corner shop she once shared with her son, Vinay. A speeding car had hurled 20-year-old Vinay off his scooter in east Delhi, and the footage shows a crowd of onlookers surrounding him, and doing nothing.

1232,"Ad Green Bay Packers kick returner and WR Ty Montgomery flew under the radar with the most heads up play out of any NFL snap Sunday. On a late 1st quarter kickoff during the Lions-Packers game yesterday, Montgomery received a lions kick that ended up near the 3-yard line. Instead of waiting for it to roll into the end zone for a touchback or have it be downed by the kicking team, Montgomery purposely stepped out of bounds before diving on top of the ball while his feet remained out of bounds. Instead of the Packers beginning their drive at the 3-yard line or even the 25 (have there been a touchback), Green Bay was able to advance the ball to the 40-yard line due to a penalty. Not just any penalty though, it’s one that warrants one of the heftiest yardage punishments of any. That penalty states that via the NFL rulebook, if the ball comes into contact with a player that is out of bounds, the ball is hear-by considered out of bounds. If you think of it like an electric current, Montgomery was the connect that was able to, through him, make the ball technically out of bounds.

1234,"This is an exceptionally good question. When, during a TV interview, the children of Donald Trump were asked who his favourite was, they all agreed it was Ivanka. Why? Because she is beautiful! Trump wants to be seen with women he regards as being beautiful, because it increases his male Ego status. He likes Ivanka because of her looks. I quote Trump literally: ""I made her myself and she has a beautiful body"". There is more, where this comes from! Trump about Ivanka: ""If I were not her father, and if I were not happily married, I would probably date her"". Now, here is your answer! Women are worthy and they are useful, if they have a body, Trump regards as being beautiful. If they are sexy. If they look like fashion models. But if she has average looks from Trump’s point of view, Trump is not interested in her! Not even if she is a Prime Minister or a Professor! Not even, if she is his own daughter! Who cares? If they do not have a body Trump regards as being beautiful, they ain’t worth shit to Trump. Why should he talk about Tiffany? Her body is not beautiful enough to be taken seriously by Trump. I feel very, very deeply for Tiffany! Her life must be a living hell of inferiority, not getting the attention Ivanka gets! And this only because of her looks! And she is not ever allowed to speak her mind, because look what Trump does to dissenters! The Attorney General was fired for not agreeing with his Muslim ban. Do you think Trumps children will ever have the guts to stand up to Trump? Do you have your favourite child? And do his/her siblings know? Trump despises women whom he considers to have average looks! They are deemed unworthy of his Male Chauvinist attention. This is what Trump shows, by not even talking about her! And many women agree with him! Because if they had not voted for him, he would not have been President. Greetings! Robert. This is a postscript to my answer. in a comment to this reply, a man asked me the next question! ""You say Trump only likes beautiful women. Then why did so many ugly women press charges against him for sexual harrassment?"" I confronted him, because this is an outrageously discriminatory question! There are no ugly women! ""Ugly"" is a male chauvinist term to humiliate women. It is not a ""scientific term based on thorough observation and careful analysis of the data"". So I ruffled his feathers and shook his tree! Now he took revenge against me! He started trolling me and harrassing me with a process of interrogation to humiliate me. When you stick up for women in this male oriented society, machos lay you under heavy mortar fire to anihilate your position! After a few warnings, I finally blocked him. When you stick up for women, when you are a man, be careful! Your male macho brothers will backstab you, troll you, insult you and drag you through the mud, face down! With friends like that, who needs enemies? But then again, male machos will never be my friends! The commentaries have been removed, after I blocked him. Kind Regards!

Look closer The people on the cover of the textbook ARE HOLDING COPIES OF THE TEXTBOOK WITH A PHOTO OF THEM ON THE COVER. It's some crazy Inception math textbook shit, and whenever it resurfaces online people cannot handle it. The image first gained attention a year ago on Reddit (and has appeared in at least one post on BuzzFeed, too). This week a tweet with the textbook cover went viral: how the fuck are they already on the textbook if theyre posing for it ""When I sent it I honestly expected a couple likes, maybe a retweet or two AT MOST,"" said Isabelle, the Twitter user, who declined to give her last name to BuzzFeed News. Isabelle put out a call for people to explain the image. Her personal theory involved a green screen. Or maybe it was... This woman had a theory that they took the photo and then printed it on a few textbooks for the students to hold — and then took another photo. But people were very skeptical. Some had dark theories about what was going on. A guy said his entire class got into a debate about the book last year. Conclusion: Photoshop! Most people seemed to think the publisher took an image of the students, added in the title and background, and then used that new image for the textbooks in the students' hands. If that's the case, then the image of students was likely a stock image, right? Right. In fact, a Reddit user found it a while back: These ""Multicultural College students, male and female"" are indeed holding something different in the original. And if you look at the textbook version, the students' arms cover up where the textbook would have to be. After being contacted by BuzzFeed News, the publisher of the textbook looked at Isabelle's tweet and said they are ""absolutely overwhelmed"" by the response on Twitter. The company also tweeted a reply: Our goal is to keep students front and center in all we do.

That it’s told through the language and rhythms of hip-hop and R&B — genres that remain mostly foreign to the musical theater tradition — has put it in contention to redefine what an American musical can look and sound like. As Mr. Brantley wrote in his review of the show Off Broadway, the songs in ""Hamilton"" could be performed ""more or less as they are by Drake or Beyoncé or Kanye."" Ethel Merman it ain’t.

Dopps has invented Mensez, an adhesive ""lipstick"" that is applied to a woman’s lady parts to block their menstruation. And it comes undone when the woman urinates. Yes, this man was clearly not at school when his class was taught about the female anatomy. In a post on Facebook, Mensez claims: Have you ever woke up with your lips stuck together? It didn’t hurt and it was kinda fun. All you had to do was to wet your lips from the inside with saliva and they became unstuck. This is the principle behind Mensez. Mensez is a natural combination of amino acids and oil in a lipstick applicator that is applied to the lips downunder during the period. It causes them to stick together, strong enough to prevent leakage, that is until the user urinates. The urine instantly unsticks the labia and allows everything to wash out into the toilet. 'Simply wipe, and reapply,' it advises. In an even more bizarre turn of events, his product is patented.  Unfortunately for Dopps, he managed to alienate and insult his entire customer base with another Facebook post, where he wrote: Yes, I am a man and you as a woman, should have come up with a better solution than diapers and plugs, but you didn’t. Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25 per cent of the time, making them far less productive than they could be.

1249,"It has been a mystery why some people love some vegetables like broccoli, while others find it to be bitter, even though most people have the same genes for bitter taste receptors. Now scientists may have found the missing link -- it's not only people's genetic makeup that determines people's reaction to broccoli's bitter taste, but also how these genes are instructed to make taste receptors, according to a new study published today (Sept. 11) in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The most-studied gene for bitter taste receptor, TASR38, comes in two types. People who have only one type or the other may be at the extremes -- they are either very sensitive to bitterness, or don't taste it unless it's very strong. But most people are somewhere in between, having one copy of each type. However, even within this group of ""moderate tasters"" who have the same genes, there is greatly varied sensitivity to bitterness. [Tip of the Tongue: The 7 (Other) Flavors Humans May Taste] In the study, 18 people with the same bitter taste genes rated the bitterness level of several beverages, including broccoli juice and carrot juice. The researchers took small samples of tissue from the participants' taste buds. Taste buds, small bumps that cover the tongue, contain taste receptors. The researchers measured the amount of a molecule in the taste buds, called messenger RNA (mRNA), which contains instructions for making bitter taste receptors. The results showed a direct relationship between how much mRNA people's cells made, and their bitterness ratings of broccoli juice. People who had the most mRNA for bitter taste receptor rated the juice as most bitter. ""The amount of messenger RNA that taste cells choose to make may be the missing link in explaining why some people with 'moderate taster' genes still are extremely sensitive to bitterness in foods and drinks,"" said study researcher Danielle Reed, a geneticist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. The findings shows a new level of complexity in taste perception, and may ultimately lend insight into individual differences in food preferences and dietary choices, the researchers said. Although the finding has solved one mystery, it has opened the door to new questions.","it's not only people's genetic makeup that determines people's reaction to broccoli's bitter taste, but also how these genes are instructed to make taste receptors"

1252,"Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith banded together to form United Artists nearly a hundred years ago, with hopes of controlling their own work and liberating it from the studios’ grip. Filmmakers today face similar challenges in gaining control of their work from faceless commercial entities. While there are, of course, more opportunities for creating work than ever before, filmmakers are also increasingly facing roadblocks to getting that work seen by the public. This is where Net Neutrality comes into play. The past generation has seen an explosion in the volume of content consumed over the Internet, accompanied by a lack of infrastructure to support the flow of that information. If there isn’t enough bandwidth for all of the content that a set of subscribers to an ISP (such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.) require, then the ISP either has to build additional bandwidth or ration the existing bandwidth. A lack of bandwidth to support video streaming manifests for the viewer as ""buffering"" messages and stuttering playback. These pauses deliver a disappointing experience for the viewer and it can (and will) cause them to seek out a better option. Net Neutrality is important because it affects how and when this rationing occurs. If viewers are already paying for content, they will be hard-pressed to pay a second time to optimize the viewing of that content. At the same time, any content provider (including Fandor) wants to make sure that their customers have the best experience possible and don’t leave the service due to poor quality viewing. The natural progression of rationing is not pretty: those services that have greatest ability to pay will have their content favored by the ISPs. If only filmmakers could simply make great films and have them seen by their eager fans. If only viewers could choose which films they wanted to watch and not have that choice made for them by the companies they pay to deliver content. There’s much to think about when it comes to the control of art and its flow to the public. Unfortunately, as was true a hundred years ago, power still belongs to those that have the money or resources to organize. The Internet has created an amazing opportunity to easily connect people with shared interests. In this case, it’s not just the artists who need to unite, it’s the viewers. The more informed we all are about what the challenges are, the more organized we can be to confront them.

1260,"(ANTIMEDIA) Wilmington, DE — As it turns out, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share something pertinent in common, after all — a tax haven cozily nested inside the United States. This brick-and-mortar, nondescript two-story building in Wilmington, Delaware would be awfully crowded if its registered occupants — 285,000 companies — actually resided there. What’s come to be known as the ""Delaware loophole"" — the unassuming building at 1209 North Orange Street — has become, as the Guardian described, ""famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax."" We're revolutionizing the news industry, but we need your help! Click here to get started. Reportedly dozens of Fortune 500 companies — Coca-Cola, Walmart, American Airlines, and Apple, to name a few — use Delaware’s strict corporate secrecy laws and legal tax loopholes by registering the North Orange Street address for official business. ""Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse — all have turned up at the Delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks,"" the New York Times’ Leslie Wayne described in 2012. ""It’s easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked."" While the legitimacy of taxes as a concept may be up to personal interpretation, what matters in Clinton’s use of the so-called Delaware loophole, in particular, is her constant harping on the need for corporations and elite individuals to pay their fair share. In other words, Clinton’s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling, Do As I Say, Not As I Do. And, as the Guardian notes, both of ""the leading candidates for president – Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump – have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why."" As Rupert Neate explained for the Guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows ""companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state."" In fact, some have claimed — all revelations of Panamanian documents aside — the use of tax-friendly locations inside the U.S. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with Delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. Clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes. ""Some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere,"" Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO annual Constitutional Convention earlier this month. ""We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America."" Oh, the irony. According to Neate, a Clinton spokesman explained, ""ZFS [Holdings, LLC] was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure."" Why, if what the spokesman claims to be true, would Clinton bother using an address in Delaware? Of the 515 companies Trump officially registered with the Federal Election Commission, ""We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware,"" the billionaire told the Guardian, ""meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don’t feel guilty at all, OK?"" Delaware’s incredibly business-friendly structure that allows for such a crowded address is completely legal, though the ability to create shell corporations lends to shady dealings and is ""a magnet ... which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes,"" as a report by the Institute on Taxation and Foreign Policy has described. Still, Clinton’s constant moralizing on tax transparency — and her spokesperson’s claims she hasn’t benefited from the North Orange Street address — proves, yet again, her stances offer little in the way of a solid foundation.

1267,"This weekend seems certain to bring raucous celebration to the streets of Madrid, Tokyo or Istanbul, as the International Olympic Committee awards the 2020 summer games to one of those three cities, all currently vying to play host. For the two metropolises whose bids fall short, stunned disappointment will surely descend, as city leaders bemoan a lost economic opportunity. Yet this inevitable reaction fails to account for a little-understood reality of the Olympics as catalyst for urban development: In seeking to host the games, coming in second tends to work out better, say economists who have studied this phenomenon. The runner-up tends to invest in the same sort of infrastructure aimed at impressing the Olympic committee, such as roadway improvements and modern signage, which assist in spurring trade and commerce. But the No. 2 choice then gets spared the expense and hassle of actually hosting the games. The result is a surge of productive investment in the early stages, and an avoidance of the sort of white elephant construction projects that get built right before the games commence. ""There is no way that it’s in your national interest to host the games, but it may be in your interest to bid for the games,"" said Andrew Rose, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-wrote a 2009 paper on the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics. According to Rose’s research, countries that hosted the Olympics between 1950 and 2006 saw a 30 percent jump in international trade thanks to measures they took while they were trying to impress the IOC -- including political decisions like opening up trade or allowing freer exchange in the national currency. It might sound like a good argument for hosting, Rose said, were it not for the fact that bidding countries not selected saw an economic impact ""every bit as big as the effect of actually hosting the games."" The positive outcome for the runner-up nations reflects the nature of the Olympic host bidding process, Rose said. In the multi-year campaign for Olympic glory, countries generally take productive steps to open and modernize their economies. ""You want to send a signal to the world and to your own populace that you’re opening up, that you’re an important part of the world, and hosting a mega-event is one way to do that,"" Rose said. ""Of course, it’s better if you don’t have to pay for it."" Stephen Billings, a professor of urban economics at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, N.C., has similarly studied the economic gains seen from hosting the Olympics. His conclusion: Cities that get as far as the finalist stage are already winners. ""There’s no real difference between runner-up cities and the ones that are eventually selected,"" Billings said. He explained that, in nearly all cases, cities bidding to host the games spend the years before the final IOC decision building up their infrastructure, a dynamic that yields positive economic fruits. In fact, many economists have said that having the games rarely benefits the host nation at all. Once they actually win the bid, cities spend massive sums on stadiums and Olympic villages that often prove less useful in the future. The expensive projects tend to experience massive cost overruns as construction deadlines approach. And security costs running into the billions of dollars have made the possibility of running a profitable Olympics even less likely in a post-9/11 world. Of the three cities currently vying for the Olympics, Madrid has presented a self-described ""low-budget"" option, costing an estimated $5 billion. The city says it will rely heavily on existing infrastructure and will only need to build four stadiums for the event. Some 19 new Olympic Village apartment blocks will be reused as housing projects once the games have left town. Those projections haven’t stopped critics on the country’s political left from labeling the event, being sought at a time when Spain is facing Depression-level unemployment and a foreclosure crisis, as ""The Hunger Games."" Istanbul has pulled out all stops, proposing a $19 billion budget for the Olympics. Tokyo’s proposal involves $8 billion in projected expenses. An April report by the IOC team scored various aspects of each city’s bid, giving an edge to Madrid and Tokyo, with preliminary scores of 8.08 and 8.02, respectively. Istanbul received a score of 6.98. ""Nearly all academic economists who aren’t connected to the IOC agree that the Olympics are extremely expensive events and that cities have almost no chance to make up those costs,"" said Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at Holy Cross University in Worcester, Mass., who has also studied the issue. There have been exceptions, Matheson noted, including profitable games in Los Angeles in 1984 and an Olympics in Barcelona in 1992, which helped transform the Spanish metropolis from an industrial second city into one of Europe’s most important tourist destinations. But those cases are highly unusual: Los Angeles presented a low-ball bid that was accepted by the Olympic Committee for lack of better options. Barcelona ""had the perfect combination for the event,"" Matheson said -- ""a hidden gem city that had a lot to offer tourists, but wasn’t well-known to the world."" The people pushing for their cities to be Olympic hosts are not ignorant of these facts, Matheson said, but they may convince themselves their city is the next Barcelona. ""It’s almost like what they say about a second marriage: It’s the triumph of hope over experience,"" Matheson said. Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., takes a dimmer view. His extensive research on the topic has shown him that cities most likely to win Olympic host bids are the ones with opaque political institutions captured by special interests, he said. ""The city that wins is likely the one that has outbid everyone because they have a lot of construction companies and construction unions, and maybe lawyers, and maybe investment bankers who are looking to float the loans, all pushing hard for this,"" Zimbalist said. ""It’s a self-perpetuating Olympic juggernaut.""","The runner-up tends to invest in the same sort of infrastructure aimed at impressing the Olympic committee, such as roadway improvements and modern signage, which assist in spurring trade and commerce. But the No. 2 choice then gets spared the expense and hassle of actually hosting the games."
1268,"If you believe the conclusions that have been reached by some tech bloggers and smartphone fans following early iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leaks, this year’s new iPhone models are going to be boring. Forget the fact that absolutely nothing has been confirmed at this point and forget the fact that we have yet to hear anything about new features that Apple might plan to introduce alongside its new iPhone models. Boring... You’re crazy if you think we already know all there is to know about Apple’s next-generation iPhones. Even if we operate under the assumption that everything we’ve seen so far is accurate, what new flagship feature is Apple cooking up for this year’s launch? What exactly is that dual camera setup going to do on the iPhone 7 Plus? And what about the Smart Connector on the back? There are plenty more unknowns as well, and more puzzle pieces will undoubtedly fall in place in the coming weeks and months. Case in point: A fresh leak on Wednesday may have revealed a major change that we never saw coming. MUST SEE: My 5 favorite new iOS 10 features that no one is talking about Back in late May, we enjoyed what was likely our first look at a real iPhone 7. The phone certainly doesn’t appear to feature a revolutionary redesign of any kind, but it does look like it improves upon the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s design in a number of key ways. Namely, it’s thinner and it sports less offensive antenna lines. But around front, things may be an entirely different story. A new photo posted by MobiPicker shows us what the gadget blog claims to be the front of an iPhone 7. The authenticity of the image isn’t confirmed, but it shows a huge change that hasn’t previously been reported by any solid sources. Here’s the photo in question: Let’s look a bit closer: Now, we’ve known for some time that Apple is hard at work trying to remove the home button from its iPhone and iPad lineup. The company has been awarded a number of patents for technology that might allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint sensor beneath a device’s display. As a result, Apple would be able to build much more compact devices since it wouldn’t need so much room beneath the screen. The iPhone 7 might be the first big step toward realizing that goal. In the leaked photo, the iPhone 7’s home button doesn’t appear to be a button at all. Instead, it looks like a touch sensitive tap target with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor embedded beneath it. And in all likelihood, if this photo does show a real iPhone 7 — and that’s a big ""if"" — the new capacitive home button will support 3D Touch as well. This would let Apple release a device that still supports all of the same home button features as earlier models, including things like Reachability and Siri, without the need for a physical button. With reports stating that early iPhone 7 production is already underway, we probably won’t have to wait long before this rumor is either corroborated or disproven by subsequent leaks.",home button doesn’t appear to be a button

Unlike many superheroes who wear masks, the Man of Steel does nothing to cover his face when fighting crime, but hides under a simple pair of glasses as reporter Clark Kent. Readers have spent decades laughing about how impossible this seems, but it may surprise you to learn that a pair of spectacles actually do a rather good job of masking a person's looks. Researchers at the University of York recently conducted a study about the effect that glasses have when it comes to facial recognition, and while the thinking behind the experiment was driven by important world matters like border control security, they seemingly inadvertently showed that Researchers at the University of York recently conducted a study about the effect that glasses have when it comes to facial recognition, and while the thinking behind the experiment was driven by important world matters like border control security, they seemingly inadvertently showed that Clark Kent 's disguise is somewhat plausible. According to CNN , 59 participants in the research were shown side-by-side photographs in three different categories: images of people wearing glasses, images of people not wearing glasses, and images where one individual is wearing glasses and the other isn't. In the first two categories, the participants were correct 80 percent of the time - but that success rate dropped to 74 percent when it came to the third category. Kay Ritchie, a co-author of the study, explained why this seemingly insignificant change is actually pretty important: A six percent drop in performance may not sound like much, but if you consider the number of people who go through passport control at Atlanta International airport every year - over 100 million last year - a six percent drop in accuracy equates to 6 million misidentifications. We hope this work can be used to inform future policies on face identification, particularly given the discrepancy between different forms of photo ID when it comes to wearing glasses.","According to CNN , 59 participants in the research were shown side-by-side photographs in three different categories: images of people wearing glasses, images of people not wearing glasses, and images where one individual is wearing glasses and the other isn't.

1279,"""You’re so lucky you don’t have twins,"" said a mom of two crying babies to another NICU mother who was watching her sleeping daughter. That mother was Millie Smith. And that comment nearly broke her. ""I ran out of the room in tears and they had no idea why,"" she told Babble You see, Millie actually was a mama of twins, Callie and Skye. Unfortunately, Skye didn’t make it. She died just a few short hours after she was born. However, Millie was too distraught to set the woman’s comment straight, so she just cried her heart out instead. Facebook/ She had been dealing with the struggle of potentially losing Skye since she was just 12 weeks pregnant. Doctors told Millie that Skye had anencephaly, which severely affects the development of the brain. With no known treatment or cure, they warned her that infants with her condition rarely lived long after birth.Facebook/ The Skye High Foundation ""I didn’t have the heart to tell them what had happened,"" she said. ""A simple sticker would have avoided that entire situation."" From that point forward, she was determined to make sure that other mothers would not have to experience that same heart-wrenching feeling. It’s hard enough losing a child, and having the added grief of a stranger mistakenly assume that child never even existed only deepens the wound. So Millie came up with an idea that is now helping other grieving moms in her situation. She created a crowdfunding page called ""Skye’s Wish"" in order to raise money for purple butterfly stickers to be placed next to NICU newborns who lost a brother or sister. The stickers are now being used at Kingston Hospital in the UK where Millie delivered, and they are accompanied by a sign that reads, ""When visiting this Neonatal unit as either a partner, relative or friend please be aware of the butterfly logo on each cot. This represents a baby that was part of a multiple pregnancy but sadly all of the babies did not survive."" Millie hopes to use the additional money raised through Skye’s Wish to provide bereavement midwives and special delivery rooms for mothers going through infant loss. ""Ultimately I will never be able to stop this from happening but the more support groups we can set up and put things in place like the stickers the better it will be,"" she said . ""It’s the hardest thing anyone has to deal with."" Praise God for moms like Millie who are turning their tragedy into hope for other struggling mothers.",NICU newborns who lost a brother or sister
1283,"The LA Times published a beautifully written opinion article by former Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. He felt the need to explain to his millions of loyal fans that letting Donald Trump win the Presidency was just not an option. Below is the letter. The conventions are over and the general election has officially begun. In the primaries, I received 1,846 pledged delegates, 46% of the total. Hillary Clinton received 2,205 pledged delegates, 54%. She received 602 superdelegates. I received 48 superdelegates. Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and I will vigorously support her. Donald Trump would be a disaster and an embarrassment for our country if he were elected president. His campaign is not based on anything of substance — improving the economy, our education system, healthcare or the environment. It is based on bigotry. He is attempting to win this election by fomenting hatred against Mexicans and Muslims. He has crudely insulted women. And as a leader of the ""birther movement,"" he tried to undermine the legitimacy of our first African American president. That is not just my point of view. That’s the perspective of a number of conservative Republicans. In these difficult times, we need a president who will bring our nation together, not someone who will divide us by race or religion, not someone who lacks an understanding of what our Constitution is about. On virtually every major issue facing this country and the needs of working families, Clinton’s positions are far superior to Trump’s. Our campaigns worked together to produce the most progressive platform in the history of American politics. Trump’s campaign wrote one of the most reactionary documents. Clinton understands that Citizens United has undermined our democracy. She will nominate justices who are prepared to overturn that Supreme Court decision, which made it possible for billionaires to buy elections. Her court appointees also would protect a woman’s right to choose, workers’ rights, the rights of the LGBT community, the needs of minorities and immigrants and the government’s ability to protect the environment. Trump, on the other hand, has made it clear that his Supreme Court appointees would preserve the court’s right-wing majority. Clinton understands that in a competitive global economy we need the best-educated workforce in the world. She and I worked together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family in this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less – 83% of our population – will be able to go to a public college or university tuition free. This proposal also substantially reduces student debt. Trump, on the other hand, has barely said a word about higher education. Clinton understands that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it is absurd to provide huge tax breaks to the very rich. Trump, on the other hand, wants billionaire families like his to enjoy hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax breaks. Clinton understands that climate change is real, is caused by human activity and is one of the great environmental crises facing our planet. She knows that we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and move aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Trump, on the other hand, like most Republicans, rejects science and the conclusions of almost all major researchers in the field. He believes that climate change is a ""hoax,"" and that there’s no need to address it. Clinton understands that this country must move toward universal healthcare. She wants to see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their healthcare exchange, that anyone 55 or older should be able to opt in to Medicare, and that we must greatly improve primary healthcare through a major expansion of community health centers. She also wants to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. And what is Donald Trump’s position on healthcare? He wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act, throw 20 million people off the health insurance they currently have and cut Medicaid for lower-income Americans. During the primaries, my supporters and I began a political revolution to transform America. That revolution continues as Hillary Clinton seeks the White House. It will continue after the election. It will continue until we create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 percent – a government based on the principle of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. I understand that many of my supporters are disappointed by the final results of the nominating process, but being despondent and inactive is not going to improve anything. Going forward and continuing the struggle is what matters. And, in that struggle, the most immediate task we face is to defeat Donald Trump.",Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and I will vigorously support her.

The neighbourhood restaurant is running a free appetiser special and you're eager to snap it up. You get a 10-buck starter for free. Good deal for you. But is it a good deal for your server? Not if you're a pathetic tipper. See Also USA travel guide You're a pathetic tipper if you punish your server by tipping on the reduced amount on your bill. That's assuming you had decent service, of course. Your free appetiser plate didn't just materialise before you. It didn't put in its own order. It didn't deliver itself. And after you inhaled the food, your empty plate didn't spirit itself into the dishwasher. Tipping can be complex, but it's not tricky. It's a topic worth exploring. If you enjoyed your food and service, you tip your server. Your server, by the way, is likely just one member of the service team that attended to your table. Your server, more than likely, makes less than minimum wage and depends on tips for his/her living. See also: 20 things that will surprise first-time visitors to the US The gratuity topic has stirred in the national conversation since last year, when some notable restaurant groups adopted no-tipping policies. One of those companies, Joe's Crab Shack, has scaled back on its gratuity-less endeavours. The chain's own research found some 60 per cent of its diners disapproved of the policy because they felt it might zap a server's drive, and because they didn't fully trust management to be fair to its workers, CNN Money reported. There are no hard and fast rules on tipping, but maybe that's because a sense of fairness is implied. And this fairness meter should kick in automatically when you use gift cards or coupons or take advantage of that special freebie deal. Of course, this doesn't always happen. Listen to what happened to one local server, a woman we'll call Mary. Mary and a coworker served a table of eight diners at a local restaurant. At the end of the night, the bill totalled about $US300 ($A414). A fair tip after a night of good service might have been at least $US60, 20 per cent of the pre-tax amount. (Because there were two servers, I might have tipped a bit more.) If service was just OK, that tip might have been closer to $US45, or 15 per cent. But Mary and her fellow server got about $US10 less than that lower amount - and they had to share it. (""That's before we had to tip out the bartender and host,"" the server noted in an email to The Palm Beach Post.) See also: Top 10 tips on tipping in America The culprit? After the bill was split three ways, one of the bill-paying parties used a gift card. The $US75 card was applied to a $US143 amount, leaving a new total of $US68. ""They tipped us $US13,"" Mary wrote. That $US13 tip is not even 10 per cent of $US143. Gift card: great for diner, awful for server. It didn't help that at least two of the three paying factions were pretty pathetic tippers. One coupon user paid tip on the reduced amount. Another bill-payer left a 15 per cent tip. And, well, that gift card user might as well have written ""TIP"" on a scrap of paper. Gift cards and coupons don't have to spell ""no tip for you"" for a competent server. Not if the diner is fair. Some local establishments who offer special deals routinely encourage their customers to be mindful. ""We always encourage our guests to tip on any pre-discounted amount, or on whatever the retail price would have been,"" says Jason Emmett, president of the Lake Worth-based Duffy's Sports Grill chain of 32 Florida restaurants. ""For me, that would be the right way."" Whatever discount or deal a restaurant offers should not be held against the server, he said. See also: Tipping overseas guide for Australians: 10 mistakes to avoid The Duffy's chain makes it possible for its restaurants to offer a gratuity guideline on each check, listing amounts for 15 percent, 18 percent and 20 percent. ""However it's at each general manager's discretion as to whether their store will use the feature or not,"" says Sandy Nelson, Duffy's marketing director. ""If they use it, then it will appear on all guest checks. Some find it useful when they have more tourists in their area."" Those suggested tips are calculated on the subtotal amount, before any coupons or gift card discounts are applied, she notes. Of course, we know tipping is optional. It's a diner's acknowledgement of a server's effort. Emmett knows this and offers that his company works to make sure service is on point by emphasizing training and encouraging exceptional servers. ""To be a good server, you have to have a passion. Servers are not motivated by the hourly wage. The great ones get that they're in charge of their own income,"" he says. If the diners they serve aren't pathetic tippers, that is. TIPPING TIP 101 The standard tip for good service is 20 per cent, etiquette experts say.

That designation is only truly deserved by the scores of obsessed people meticulously going over every transcript and photo from the Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey trials. Internet sleuthing gets a bad rap these days, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the dedication these people have when it comes to figuring out what really happened to murder victim Teresa Halbach. The latest discovery from this group comes from an analysis of the bone fragments pulled from the fire pit prosecutors accuse Steven Avery of using to burn Halbach’s body. During his trial they claimed his backyard bonfire burned so hot it obliterated her remains, leaving nothing but tiny bone fragment remains without any DNA left. But when fans took a closer look at the ‘human’ fragments collected, one stood out. Property tag 7955 included a bone that is clearly the carpometacarpus of a bird. View photos making-a-murderer-bird-bone-fragment More Case File That brings us back to claims from the defense that Avery’s burn pit was regularly used to dispose of deer, rodents, and fowl remains from hunting. How many of the bone fragments collected and attributed to Halbach were just burnt animal remains? It also makes us wonder how a fire could be so powerful it reduced Halbach’s body to small flakes, yet this bird wing bone remained largely intact? As with many of the key pieces of evidence in the Making A Murderer case, there’s a lot of controversy surrounding the bones found in Steven Avery’s burn pit. A proper forensic grid was never set up, and material from the pit was simply shoveled into boxes and sifted through back at the labs. Record keeping and chain of command protocols were largely ignored by the forensic labs, and the defense in Steven Avery’s trial complained ""It is unclear whether some, all, or none of the fragments had been previously determined by the state’s forensic anthropologist to be human or not. In short, the defense has no way of knowing from this cryptic report what was sent to and examined by the FBI Lab."" View photos making-a-murderer-bone-box More Case File / Making A Murderer Steven Avery’s guilt was largely assumed by the public once news reports said Teresa Halbach’s remains were found in his back yard. But that claim, made so persuasively by prosecutor Ken Kratz during Avery’s trial, wasn’t backed up by much science. IDing the remains as Halbach’s was extremely difficult. The best the forensic labs could do was with one bit of tissue that had enough mitochondrial DNA for a test. But that test is supposed to give readings on 16 points of DNA in order to be usable. The lab could only get results on 7. Yet instead of reporting that as ‘inconclusive’, forensic scientist Shelley Culhane claimed the chances the mitochondrial DNA came from anyone other than Halback was ""one in a billion."" This statistic is simply wrong — Someone checked out a single small mitochondrial DNA database of 65,000 people and found 122 matches at 9 points. So you’ve got a single fragment of bone that gave a test result with less than half the required matching points to prove Steven Avery burned Teresa Halbach’s body on his property. That’s not a lot of evidence. Forensics didn’t have much better luck in Stephen Avery’s garage, where prosecutors claim Steven Avery executed Halbach with a hunting rifle. Not a single hint of Halbach’s blood was recovered from that crime scene, although a bullet found there in March (the initial investigation searches were conducted in November) was tested by Culhane, who found Teresa Halbach’s DNA on it. Interestingly enough, the DNA on the bullet was in the form of nucleated cells and not blood, just more ammunition for those who think evidence was planted by investigators.","During his trial they claimed his backyard bonfire burned so hot it obliterated her remains, leaving nothing but tiny bone fragment remains without any DNA left.

After being on the front page for months and months, she did not want to draw attention to herself. She wanted to go into the law firm, be a wall flower, not stand out and draw any more attention. The labels that we used were not incredibly high-end. They were very respectable labels like Ralph Lauren and Elie Tahari. As we got to the second and third seasons, we saw a sense of confidence start to bloom. She had this slight ‘40s silhouette to her look. I was like ""Oh my gosh, she’s Rosie the Riveter!"" She is totally confident with her work, her affair with her boss and sexual life. She had gotten a promotion and was making money. She was able to buy new clothes and put together more full head-to-toe outfits, including wearing more jewelry. And by the time we got into Season 4, she had been working towards becoming a partner and was wearing more high-end and color. Alicia's closet has certainly expanded, but does she ever repeat outfits? Absolutely. Maybe ten percent of her looks are things she’s done in previous episodes. Julianna loves it because she gets to wear an ""old friend,"" and from a character standpoint it makes sense because it’s real. Every piece that's repeated is basic: black pants, black skirts and navy shoes. What makes a great women's suit? Number 1: It has to fit. I know you’ve been told that a million times. But you can go buy a $150 suit from Ann Taylor and have it tailored and altered to you and it’s going to look like an $800 suit. And you can buy a $2000 suit that doesn’t fit you, that hangs off of you like a bag and it’s going to look like it’s not even yours. It’s so important for women and men when budgeting themselves for new clothes -- whether for work or recreational -- to include money for tailoring. Number 2: Go with things that are more classic that will take you from season to season. If that means spending more money on good brand name pieces that will last, then you should do so. And let the trendy pieces that fall in from season to season be what you spice up your look with each year. Number 3: Women need to know if they look better in skirts or trousers. Find the silhouette that works for you and stick with that as best you can. Moving on to Diane. How many brooches does she own? My goal is to bring the pin back [laughs]. She probably has about 30 brooches. There are a couple pins that I just love. Christine [Baranski] knows of a resale shop near her house way up in Connecticut. And she said, ""Darling, they have beautiful pieces there."" I got them on the phone and we’ve had them ever since. And I know of some vintage stores here in New York. When Christine came in for her first fitting, we had this big 10 foot long table. And it was covered in jewelry. We didn’t even talk about it because we were so into the clothes. She could see that we had tons of jewelry and that we didn’t need to worry about it. The first season, she wanted to wear a signature ring in every episode and then she got tired of it [laughs]. What's your secret to styling such a strong and determined character like Diane? In the pilot, she wore two grey suits. But what I wanted to do with Diane, as well as Alicia and Kalinda, was make them look feminine, yet powerful. I always get frustrated unless it's the character, when a strong woman is dressed up as a man. Christine had a very good point, she said, ""I’m known for my comedy and musical-comedy so I want people to believe me as a lawyer."" And that was a challenge for me. But I wanted her to be really chic and really elegant. I wanted her to wear the clothes, not have the clothes wear her. I remember we had this crazy red Gaultier blouse and the collar was a belt from a London Fog coat. And we were like is it too much, have we gone too far? We figured out a great way to drape it so that it was edgy and unique. Of course, Christine is so elegant anyway. You can put a burlap bag on her and she’d look great. For Season 4, we have been using Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, and we also used Lafayette 148 New York. We certainly do Prada and Givenchy for her. Armani is good for both Diane and Alicia. Sometimes Dior on Diane, and YSL is really big for Diane. There is also this amazing clothing line called Number 35 and they’re an English line. I discovered them the second half of the season last year. We’re collaborating on a line called 35 DL. It’s sort of high-end business wear. Hopefully, I’ll be using some of those pieces on the show. Is there anything the actors won't wear? We don’t have issues with brand names, where people are like, ""No, I never want to wear X."" But you certainly learn what silhouettes work on the actors. I tend not to do big, baggy sleeves on any of the women on the show because on camera it looks sloppy and they look sick. I do find that I slim a lot of women’s shirt sleeves and take fullness out of them because there’s just too much fabric. Last year, we used the peplum a lot and Dior was doing that wonderful nod with their new look. We like slim skirts. We never do A-line skirts. There was that whole vogue for A-line skirts and dresses for women but it doesn’t work on camera. It can work in real life though. How did Kalinda’s boots and skirts become so big? I honestly had no idea it would be such a big thing. Archie Panjabi, who plays Kalinda, wore jeans in the pilot. And I was like you know what, I don’t want her to wear that. It goes back to what I said. She’s strong and tough and really sexy. Why do we have to put her in pants? The producers said she wore boots in the pilot and they liked that. And she wore a slouch boot. So I thought, well if we are going to do a boot, let’s get it up the leg. She came in and really wanted to wear pants. We experimented and finally got her into skirts. We even tried to put her in a regular pump and she was down with it. She got all the way to set, and then turned around and said to me, ""I need the boots. I just don’t feel like Kalinda."" The actors on this show are brilliant. It’s not just about how it looks on me, but is it right for the character. With Kalinda we combine hard and soft all the time. She may wear leather, but she’ll have on a chiffon blouse. Or she’ll have high leather boots but she’ll have on a buffalo plaid skirt. We’re always trying to create this dichotomy with her looks. I think I have her figured out and then the writers do something. And I think that’s the same way the audience feels, and I want that in her clothes. It’s hard because the skirt and boots have become iconic for her. I want it to always be this element of surprise as with her sexuality. For the longest time we didn’t know that she was a lesbian or had lesbian tendencies. Then she turns around and has a relationship with a guy. What is her go-to brand for boots? A big brand that we’ve been using over the years interspersed with others is Via Spiga. You have to remember that they’re wearing this footwear for up to 14 hours a day. There has to be a comfort level, it can’t be a tortuous. But we did have to have the boots shaped for her. The part that comes up the leg, we’d have that taken in. I’d recommend that to all women. If you’re going to invest in a pair of boots, take them to the shoe maker. It may sound crazy, but I hate when they’re all gaped at the top. It should look like your boots. What are your tips for finding a badass leather jacket like Kalinda's? Don’t have too many bells and whistles. People tend to go for the shiny bright things with a millions zippers and pulls. It may be cool for a second, but for longevity it may be hard to get versatility out of the jacket. Think about the purpose of your leather jacket. Is it to wear outside with a sweater, or a replacement for a sports jacket? Get one that fits your body well over the different layers underneath. I also feel this about leather jackets: If you have one that has a zipper down the front, get one that zips both ways. That’s because when you sit down, even when it’s that butter leather, the jacket wants to bunch up because it wants to splay out over your hips. If you get a zipper that zips up, it will smooth out. Let's discuss the best-dressed man on ""The Good Wife,"" Eli Gold. The thing with Eli I wanted to look like if you touch him he would shatter. He’s so uptight! He wears mostly Dolce & Gabbana, Versace and Paul Smith. I wanted him in two-button suits that feel very snugged to create that stiff look. Normally when a guy buttons a suit jacket and there are two buttons, he buttons just the top. Eli buttons both. The first time I saw that, I told the set costumer to go tell Alan [Cumming] to unbutton that bottom button and he said, ""Nah, I’m going to wear this closed."" And I wasn't going to go to the mat for that, or argue with the actor about it. But it made sense because if he was going to have 10 buttons, he would button them all up. That’s his thing. His collar and tie are always done up, practically strangling himself. There’s always a perfect knot on the tie, and it’s just like relax, dude. Can you give us a sneak peek into what we can expect from the cast's Season 5 style? We find out that Alicia is going to start her own law firm with Cary [Agos]. She still has the money and ensemble of suits, but heading into the new season, I dial back the color with the uncertainty of what’s to come. I wanted her wardrobe to be more neutral-toned again and Julianna felt that as well. Overall, the clothing will change but it can’t change too drastically because that’s not real. When something drastic happens you don’t go out and buy a whole new wardrobe. I always want the evolution of the look to be steady and methodical. And this season is no different.",very respectable labels like Ralph Lauren and Elie Tahari

1297,"It was unthinkable in every way. When Dave Hickman was 14 years old, he and his grandfather went hunting.  After hearing a strange cooing sound, Dave decided to investigate.  He discovered a baby abandoned in the woods. She was soaking wet, her lips blue, wrapped in nothing but a towel. That was in 1955 and for 58 years, Dave couldn’t shake what had happened.  ""I’ve seen that image of her laying in the weeds, and me standing on top of the fence every day of my life. And I’ll probably always see that,"" he says.  Sometimes those people who affect us, especially when we are young, leave a lasting impression. Amanda Scarpinati spent her whole life trying to track down the nurse who cared for her in NCIU.  Dave said goodbye but he had no idea where the little one had gone. He’s been trying his whole life to find out what happened to her so that he can get some closure. Then, one day, he gets a call from retired sheriff John Catey that changed everything... In 1955, Dave Hickman went hunting with his grandma. While he was in the woods he heard a strange cooing noise. ""September 22, 1955, I’d been hunting with my grandfather. And I kept hearing a very odd sound. It wasn’t the sound of a baby crying, it was more of a soft cooing sound. I said, ‘I have to find out what this is.’ So I started walking up the fence,"" he told CBS. That’s when he discovered the unthinkable: a freezing cold baby girl. ""I got on top of the fence, I looked down, and there was a little baby. She was soaking wet. Her lips were blue. She was just wrapped in a towel. My grandfather said, ‘We have to do something real quick, we have to get help for the baby’,"" he said. Dave and his grandfather took the baby girl to the authorities. She was given the name Roseann Wayne.  The story about the 14-year-old boy who saved the soaking wet baby girl even made the news back then. But for Dave, the story wouldn’t end at the close of a newspaper. A few weeks later, Dave was heartbroken to have to say goodbye to Roseann when she was adopted. ""They handed her to me and they said, ‘She’s being adopted next week.’ They had her wrapped in a blanket. She was sound asleep. So I got to say goodbye to her,"" he said. But he had no idea where she was being taken. Dave spent the next 58 years trying to find the little girl he saved. But it wasn’t until 2013 that retired sheriff John Catey called him with the big news. ""[Catey] said, ‘Dave write down this name and this phone number — Mary Ellen Suey and her phone number.’ I said, ‘OK John, I said who’s that?’ (He said) ‘That’s your little girl,’ "" Dave recalls.

Naturally, this lead to someone bringing up Jennifer Aniston's nipples on Friends, which I only discovered were a 'thing'. I'd caught on to them over the years, but I never made a compilation and put it on YouTube, you know what I mean? I just put it down to a cold studio atmosphere. And then I remembered this one time from when I was a kid. Me, my mate and his bro were sat inside one Saturday on a grub break watching Friends. I don't recall the episode or particular scene, but it must have been one where Aniston's nips were having it large, cause it provoked my mate's bro to say: 'You know why you can always see Jennifer Aniston's nipples in Friends?' 'Nah, why?' we asked. 'She cut holes in her bra so her boobs could look good but natural' or something along those lines. Possibly more crass.

1303,"By now, you've almost certainly seen the video of one extraordinarily lit Christmas parade featuring children's characters pulling some fantastic dance moves. From Twitter to The Shade Room, footage of these hype kid's favorites has gone super-viral, and reactions to the party have been extremely mixed. The video was taken at the Scotland County Christmas Parade in Laurinberg, North Carolina, where the characters danced down Main Street to energize the local crowd. The dancers are from company TandL-Characters, who provide their spirited performers for a range of celebratory events. ""We perform skits and dance because no one wants to go to a party [where] the characters only wave and take pictures,"" the company's founder, Lavonda McLaughlin, told Mashable, ""Our skits and music pieces are part of the company."" While some viewers sounded off about finding the dancing inappropriate in the comments section of an article in The Laurinburg Exchange, McLaughlin defends her company's approach. ""Children love to dance - especially to the top songs that are played on the radio,"" she continued. ""There is nothing wrong with clean fun."" Negative comments on the original video also prompted its poster (and hilarious commentator) to post this:  Upon receiving negative comments, ""The kids [who work for the company] were not happy,"" McLaughlin said. ""We have never had any negativity until we did the parade in Laurinburg, North Carolina."" ""We are a family business,"" McLaughlin explained, revealing she runs the company with husband, Travis.

1305,"The challenges of a job at the White House are tough and manifold, but at least one of them—the challenge of getting heard—has historically been tougher for women. For one thing, there are fewer of them at the table: all presidents so far have been men, and among their top aides men have to date heavily outnumbered women. But another factor that weighs on how much women’s ideas get heard and credited isn’t confined to politics. Across sectors, and both in and outside work, women get interrupted more often than men—by people of both genders. The interruption disparity, backed up by decades of research, is now so recognized there’s a word for it: manterrupting. But at the White House, one former staffer explained to the Washington Post, women started using a simple rhetorical technique to stop interruptions and reinforce points made by other women. When a woman made a good point, another woman would repeat it, and give credit to the originator. This made the idea harder to ignore, or to steal. The women called the technique ""amplification."" ""We just started doing it, and made a purpose of doing it,"" one of president Barack Obama’s former aides told the Post. ""It was an everyday thing."" She said that Obama noticed and began calling on women more often. The women, perhaps unconsciously, had noticed two things. First, that repetition is one of the simplest ways of reinforcing any point—which can be seen through history across oratory and poetry. But secondly, that simply hammering a point home by repeating it oneself has limitations, especially in a competitive environment where everyone is clamoring to be heard. Some researchers have hypothesized that women are interrupted more because their conversational style tends to be collaborative, where men tend to be more competitive. The trick may have come about organically, but it’s by no means a given than women should support each others’ ideas that way. The presence of only a few women in a room historically gave rise to a different response, noted Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in her book Lean In: In the days of tokenism, women looked around the room and instead of bonding against an unfair system, they often viewed one another as competition...women wound up being ignored, undermined, and in some cases even sabotaged by other women. It’s a safe bet that many Obama staffers, and those who come after them, will have read books like Lean In and taken the lessons away. The ideas of cooperation they promote are already making their way into the wider workplace.","When a woman made a good point, another woman would repeat it, and give credit to the originator.

(1:12) The deciding game of the Western Conference championship is, not surprisingly, a very hot ticket. In fact, according to ticketing search engine TiqIQ, Monday night's game between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Golden State Warriors has the second-highest list prices for an NBA Game 7 in the past five years ($960 per ticket). The only Game 7 to top Monday night's matchup in Oakland was the 2013 NBA Finals Game 7 between the Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs ($1,346 per ticket). The Warriors put the few remaining tickets on sale Sunday night, with prices ranging from $230 to $2,150. They sold out in less than five minutes. At $960 a ticket, Monday night's game to determine the Western Conference champion boasts the second-highest list prices for an NBA Game 7 in the past five years, topped only by the 2013 NBA Finals, according to ticketing search engine TiqIQ. Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Those prices did not include any floor seats, which were sold out. But someone did go to the Warriors' resale site, run by Ticketmaster, and purchased two floor seats for $29,000 each. A spokesman for StubHub, which has appealed a federal judge's decision to dismiss its lawsuit against the Warriors and Ticketmaster, said its average sold ticket for the game was $824, with the cheapest seat at $359. StubHub has accused the team and Ticketmaster of conspiring to control both the primary and secondary ticket markets. Warriors officials have said that having Ticketmaster control both the primary and resale markets helps to make sure tickets are authentic. Warriors spokesperson Lisa Goodwin said the team had to turn away 80 fans for Game 5 at Oracle Arena on Thursday night because the tickets scanned as fraudulent.","But someone did go to the Warriors' resale site, run by Ticketmaster, and purchased two floor seats for $29,000 each."

1309,"Why Some People Are Hurt More by Break-Ups Than Others A friend once grumbled that, given the choice, she’d rather see her ex miserable than herself happy. Few things in life are as traumatic as the end of a long-term, romantic relationship. Nonetheless, many people are able to eventually recover and move on relatively unscathed. Others, like my friend, aren’t so lucky. Even years later, they remain mired in the pain of the experience. Any reminder of their former partner – whether it’s a casual mention in conversation or a Facebook photo – can elicit profound feelings of sadness, anger and resentment. Why is it that some people continue to be haunted by the ghosts of their romantic pasts, struggling to let go of the pain of rejection? In new research , my colleague Carol Dweck and I found that rejection actually makes some people redefine themselves—and their future romantic prospects. In one study, we asked people to write about any lessons they’d taken away from a past romantic rejection. Analyzing their responses, we realized that a number of respondents thought the rejection unmasked a basic negative truth about themselves—one that would also sabotage their future relationships. Some said they’d realized that they were too ""clingy."" Other thought they’d been ""too sensitive"" or ""bad at communicating."" Additional studies explored the consequences of believing that rejection had revealed a fundamental flaw. By linking rejection to some aspect of their core identity, people found it more difficult to move on from the experience. Some said they ""put up walls"" and became warier about new relationships. Others were afraid to disclose the rejection to a new partner, fearing that this person would change their opinion of them, thinking they had ""baggage."" (This might explain why some people hide past rejections, treating them like a scar or stigma.) We then wondered: what makes someone more likely to link a romantic rejection to some aspect of ""who they really are""? After all, other respondents wrote that rejection was merely a part of life, that it was an important part of growing up and actually caused them to become better people. It turns out that your beliefs about personality can play a big role in how you’ll respond to romantic rejection. Past research has found that people hold divergent views about their personal characteristics, whether it’s their intelligence or shyness. Some people have a ""fixed mindset,"" believing that these qualities are unchangeable. In contrast, those who have a ""growth mindset"" believe that their personality is something that can evolve and develop throughout their lives. These basic beliefs shape how people respond to failure. For example, when people believe that intelligence is fixed, they’ll feel worse about themselves – and are less likely to persist – after experiencing a setback. We thought that beliefs about personality might determine whether people see rejection as a piece of evidence about who they really are – as a sign of whether they are a flawed and undesirable person. In one study, we divided people into two groups: those who think personality is fixed, and those who think personality is malleable. Participants then read one of two stories . In one, we asked them to imagine being left, out of the blue, by a long-term partner. In the other, we asked them to imagine meeting someone at a party, feeling a spark and then later overhearing that person telling a friend that they would never be romantically interested in her or him. We might expect that only a severe rejection from a serious relationship would have the power to make people question who they are. Instead, a pattern emerged. For people with a fixed view of personality, we found that even a rejection from a relative stranger could prompt them to wonder what this rejection unveiled about their core self. These people might worry that there was something so obviously undesirable about them that a person would reject them outright—without even getting to know them. So what can we do to prevent people from linking rejection to the self in this negative way? One promising piece of evidence shows that changing someone’s beliefs about personality can shift his or her reaction to rejections. In a final study, we created articles that described personality as something that can evolve throughout the course of a lifetime, rather than as something that’s predetermined. When we asked people with a fixed view of personality to read these articles, they became less likely to interpret rejections as an indication of a permanent, fatal deficiency. By encouraging the belief that personality can change and develop over time, we may be able to help people exorcise the ghosts of their romantic pasts—and move on to satisfying relationships in the future. This article originally appeared on The Conversation",a number of respondents thought the rejection unmasked a basic negative truth about themselves—one that would also sabotage their future relationships.
1313,"When we get all caught up thinking about the zombie apocalypse, the robot revolution, or something a little more realistic, like say, an antibiotic-resistant superbug that could seriously wipe millions of us out, we're talking small-time 'end of the world' stuff. Robots might rise up against us and destroy humanity forever, but the world will keep on spinning, and the Solar System will still have eight planets (sorry Pluto). But nothing is forever, no matter how many billions of years you've existed, and theoretical physicist Brian Greene just demonstrated to Colbert how a star like our Sun will end. Now, we don't want to alarm you or anything, but at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself, and everything we know and love will die. If you have kids, that's something you maybe want to give the delicate 'birds and the bees' treatment to when it comes time to explain that little nugget of truth to them, lest they end up like one of Louis CK's daughters, when he decided to marvel at the incredible, flaming violence of it all: ""She started crying immediately, crying bitter tears for the death of all humanity... and now she knows all of those things: she’s gonna die, everybody she knows is gonna die, they’re gonna be dead for a very long time, and then the Sun’s gonna explode. She learned that all in 12 seconds, at the age of seven."" The sad futility of existence aside, the science behind how and why a star millions of times more massive than our Sun implodes in on itself is fascinating, and nobody explains it as clearly as Greene in the video above. And he takes things one step further, by bringing a record-breaking Galilean canon into the studio to demonstrate just how far the shockwaves of destruction will emanate from a dying sun. Dude makes breaking a world record look suspiciously easy. Watch the video above to find out more about our ultimate demise, and check out this video by Physics Girl if you can't get enough of those stacked balls: Correction: The story has been corrected to make clear that the star Greene talks about in the video is much more massive than our own Sun.","at some point, our Sun is going to run out of fuel, collapse in on itself"
1314,"Australian dragons cycle through more than 350 episodes of rapid eye movement and slow-wave sleep each night, spending about half their sleeping hours in each phase. Do dragons dream? Maybe, according to new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon, for the first time. The discovery suggests that these phases of sleep may be more than 100 million years older than previously realized. REM sleep is characterized by brain waves that look similar to waking brain activity. In mammals, the large muscles of the body are immobile, but the eyes twitch randomly during REM sleep. People do most of their dreaming in this phase of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is a non-REM sleep phase that is marked by slow brain waves called delta waves. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders] Quiet, sleep-like periods are known in many animals, even invertebrates like fruit flies. However, researchers had only found REM and slow-wave sleep brain activity in mammals and birds. Both of those kinds of animals diverged from a common group, the amniotes — mammals, reptiles and birds that lay eggs on land or hold them in their bodies — more than 300 million years ago. The amniotes gave rise to the synapsids and the sauropsids. Mammals are the only group of synapsids left (the earliest arose about 195 million years ago). The sauropsids encompassed the dinosaurs as well as modern birds and reptiles. The fact that sleep appeared only in these two disparate branches of the evolutionary tree was puzzling, said lead study researcher Gilles Laurent, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Germany. It seemed that mammals and birds had independently evolved the brain patterns for REM and slow-wave sleep — a case of convergent evolution — or, more confusingly, that these sleep patterns were an ancestral trait that was lost multiple times among reptile lineages but somehow not in birds. The new research, which will be published Friday (April 29) in the journal Science, suggests a much simpler explanation: REM and slow-wave sleep were present in a common amniote ancestor, and the fingerprints of these brain patterns had been missed until now. ""It poses many questions: How did sleep start? What did it start for? Is sleep the way that we understand it today in mammals, including humans, the same thing as what it started as?"" Laurent told Live Science. ""These questions are ones we'd like to find answers to."" Laurent and his colleagues didn't intend to study sleep, at first. His lab is interested in how the cortex works, and he uses lizards as model organisms to study this brain region. The researchers were using electrodes implanted in the brains of Australian dragons (Pogona vitticeps) to record brain activity. An Australian dragon (Pogona vitticeps), the first lizard ever discovered to have mammalian-like brain patterns during sleep. The discovery, reported April 29 in the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of this brain activity may date back at least 320 million years. Credit: Dr. Stephan Junek, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research ""In the middle of some experiments we were doing, we decided to let the recordings go overnight after a day's work, just to see what would happen during the night,"" Laurent said. ""And upon analyzing the results, there were interesting oscillations of activity that were very regular, that suggested the potential existence of sleep-related patterns of activity in the brain."" Further recordings of the brains of five different lizards of the same species revealed two distinct sleep patterns. One showed high-frequency wave forms of about 20 cycles per second. The other showed low-frequency wave forms of less than 4 cycles per second. Video recordings of the sleeping lizards showed that during the high-frequency brain activity, the dragons' eyes twitched periodically. ""We had a characterization that was starting to become more and more like what we observe in mammalian sleep,"" Laurent said. ""A REM phase with broadband activity and high-frequency activity, and slow-wave sleep where there is no eye movement."" [What Do Dogs Dream About?] The slow waves also showed negative spikes of electrical potential 200 to 400 milliseconds long, interrupted with an oscillation of the brain's electrical activity, Laurent said. These ""sharp waves"" and ""ripples"" are seen in the slow brain waves of mammalian sleep, he said. Modern equipment and analysis techniques likely allowed Laurent and his team to find these brain patterns where others had failed, Laurent said. There are differences between the sleep of lizards and mammals, however. In humans, for example, the REM phase of the sleep cycle is relatively short. A person might experience just 5 minutes per hour of slow-wave sleep at the beginning of the night, and then, as this phase gradually lengthens, 15 or 20 minutes per 90 minutes of slow-wave sleep later on. In the Australian dragon, the ratio of REM to slow-wave sleep is about 50-50. And the dragon cycles between the two every minute or minute and a half. They experience up to 350 sleep cycles per night, compared to four or five in humans. These patterns arose in a brain region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, which doesn't exist in mammals, Laurent said. The sleep patterns seen in the study were similar to the ones seen in the mouse hippocampus during sleep, but strangely, the dorsal ventricular ridge is not analogous in its connections or neural cell makeup to the mammal hippocampus at all, Laurent said. The research suggests that REM and slow-wave sleep may have evolved in the amniotes, but the patterns found in the lizards studied may be even older, Laurent said. Amphibian sleep has been studied and sleep patterns have not been found, he said, but perhaps scientists need to check again. In humans, REM sleep is closely associated with dreaming. So do Australian dragons dream? There's no way to be sure right now, Laurent said. The answer may also depend on how you define dreaming. Under a strict definition in which dreaming requires higher cognition, the answer might be no. But if dreaming were defined as a replay of brain activity during sleep that resembles brain activity during wakefulness, lizards might well dream, Laurent said. ""Maybe in a few years, we'll be able to tell you,"" he said.","new research that finds rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep in a lizard, the Australian dragon"
1321,"The new Chuck Taylors are here. The first new design in 98 years. I’m wearing them right now. These absurdly, blindingly white objects are shoes. More precisely, they’re the much-hyped Converse Chuck IIs, which were released on Tuesday. By the end of that first day on sale, these lowtops were the last pair of size 11 shoes left at the company’s Manhattan flagship store. I snagged ‘em. The store had seen a rush on the newly redesigned shoes that day. The sales associate just shook his head when I handed him the popular standard-issue black hightop model. ""Try online,"" he suggested. I told him I would take any pair of the coveted new All Stars that they had in my size. Usually when there is a rush for shoes, it’s caused by a bunch of sneaker nerds lining up to get some special edition. In this case, it was more like people lining up for iPhones. This shoe will be mass-produced. There will be more next week, and the week after that, and assuming people keep buying them, there will be Chuck IIs for a hundred years, which is about how long ago the originals were released. The Converse flagship store in SoHo, New York was almost completely sold out of Chuck IIs in my size on the day the sneakers were released. But I think I understand why there was a rush on the new Chucks, even by unfashionable schlubs like me. Besides Jordans, it’s hard to imagine a shoe more iconic and beloved than the Chuck Taylor. I remember when I finally convinced my dad to let me get a pair in middle school, even over his objections that they were shit shoes that were going to fuck up my feet. I’ve gone through a pair or two per year ever since. I never found the shoes as painfully uncomfortable as some people, but their hundred-year-old design isn’t especially ergonomic. People are psyched about the new Chuck II because it retains much of the classic Converse look—I actually think they’re kind of hotter now—while introducing new design features that make them legitimately comfortable. The new Chuck II on the left, the old-school Chuck Taylor on the right. You can see many of the aesthetic changes in the sweet comparison video shot by my colleague Michael Hession. Converse sent us black hightops, but they were a size 9 which is unfortunately way, way too small for me. How do they feel on the foot? After spending a day in my new bright shining kicks, I can tell you for sure, they’re more comfortable. They feel like real shoes now, instead of like shoddy canvas sacks for feet. At the core of the design is a new foamy insole made of Lunarlon, a springy foam material designed by Coverse’s parent, Nike. Don’t let the marketing term fool you though, this is just a comfy insole. It feels much like one you would buy to put into your running shoes. In this case it’s nice to have it specially shaped and designed for the shoe itself. Besides the insole, the biggest change is the no-slip tongue, which indeed does not slip. It’s a huge change for the Chuck Taylor. The old tongue that wiggles its way to the side over time is so common that it’s central to the Chuck Taylor aesthetic. There are some aspects of the sneaker’s redesign that we’ll have to wait and see on. The Chuck IIs use some tougher-looking (and feeling) rubber construction of the rubber sole as well as the rubber that binds the sole to the rest of the shoe. This tends to be where the old-school chucks fall apart over time. Sponsored Additionally, the new chucks use a tougher canvas, which makes the overall shoe feel sturdy like it’s got real structure that supports your ankles, rather than serving as just a flimsy coat that’s draped over your feet. Will the new Chuck be more durable, or suffer the same fate of its flimsy predecessor? Is it even a Chuck Taylor if it doesn’t turn to shit over time? A pair of hightop Chuck IIs cost $75, compared to $55 for the old-school All Star. It’s worth it.",they’re more comfortable. They feel like real shoes now

1324,"First-time protester Sierra Thomas describes her experience at a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina where a black demonstrator was sucker punched by a white supporter earlier in March. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) As I sat in the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C., earlier this month, waiting for Donald Trump’s rally to start, my adrenaline began to rush. I knew I could be hurt for what I was about to do. I’d driven three hours by myself that morning from college in southern Virginia to protest his campaign. For months, I’d been reading and watching coverage of Trump’s rise. His rallies had become spaces where people felt comfortable being openly racist and hateful, because he allowed them to. And with his ugly rhetoric about Muslims, Mexicans and ""the old days"" before political correctness, he has encouraged it. Not long before the Fayetteville event, a group of black students from Valdosta State University in Georgia had been kicked out of a Trump rally at their school before they had even begun to protest. Later that week, I saw a video from another one of his rallies, in Louisville, where Shiya Nwanguma, an African American woman, was pushed around by a crowd of white men. Trump waxed nostalgic, telling the audience: ""You know, in the old days — which isn’t so long ago — when we were less politically correct, that kind of stuff wouldn’t have happened. Today we have to be so nice, so nice, we always have to be so nice."" I knew I had to do something. I couldn’t just sit and watch someone who is trying to be our president incite violence. I could not let the progress people have made in learning to love and accept one another go to waste. Trump is playing on the emotions and fears of this country to serve himself. His defenders say his campaign has nothing to do with racism, but what I saw and heard in Fayetteville — and what’s happened at other events — prove they’re wrong. If Trump makes it to the Oval Office, I’m afraid of what will happen to this nation. I want to be a teacher after I graduate; what kinds of lessons would children learn from a president who says it’s okay to kill the families of alleged terrorists and to ban people from the country because of their religion? [Here’s what demagogues like Trump do to their countries when they take power] When I watched the video of Nwanguma getting pushed around at the rally in Louisville, I grew increasingly upset, frustrated and appalled. I decided at that very moment that I would protest at the nearest and soonest rally. I went to Trump’s website and saw that there would be one in Fayetteville the following week. I ordered a ticket. I looked all over Facebook for protest groups that would be attending the rally and came across a post by a man named Jonathan Talley, who wrote about needing more protesters. He already had more than 100, though, and since this was my first time protesting, I felt safer knowing I’d have people there backing me up. I was a little nervous, because my parents didn’t want me to go. They made sure I was well aware of the danger and the consequences I might face. But I was determined not to let fear stop change, and knowing that I’d have people supporting me throughout the whole thing gave me courage. Jeers and violence erupted between Donald Trump supporters and protesters at the Republican frontrunner's rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on March 9. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) In my car driving there, I constantly reminded myself of why I was going. Sierra, don’t be afraid. You can do this. No matter what happens, remember why you’re here. This is for Shiya Nwanguma. This is for my children. This is for my ancestors. This is for every black man incarcerated, beaten and killed because of racism. This is so all Americans — white, black, Asian, Native American, brown, rich, poor — won’t have a huge target on our backs because we allowed a bigot to run this country. The organizers’ plan was for demonstrators to go into the event separately and sit by ourselves, so we wouldn’t attract attention and could pop up at different times to interrupt Trump. I walked inside and made small talk with the people sitting next to me, even though almost every second sitting there waiting was a challenge. They were very friendly, up until the moment I started protesting. Throughout the afternoon, I was texting with Talley, and he helped me calm down and stay strong, saying, ""Don’t let them shake you, and don’t be scared."" [The real reason Trump is winning: No one thought it was possible] Shortly after Trump took the stage, the protests began. And the first thing I heard from Trump was: ""Go home to Mom!"" The crowd ate it up — it seemed like a lot of them were more interested in watching the protests than in hearing his speech. A few minutes later, I heard a roar, and I received a text from Talley: ""You saw that dude punch him right?"" A Trump supporter named John McGraw had, authorities later said after video surfaced, just sucker-punched another protester, Rakeem Jones. I heard Trump say: ""Isn’t this exciting! I love it! I love it!"" He made no attempt to stop the violence but instead egged it on. Then he started that whole ""pledge to vote for me"" stunt, and I’d had enough. I felt my legs move. Here we go! Stay focused. Ignore them. Don’t be afraid. It was as if my body was on autopilot. The next thing I knew, I was in the middle of the aisle on the steps, one fist in the air, yelling, ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" No way you’re going to punch us and we’re going to sit idly by. ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" No way MY president is going to register people because of their looks, race or religion. ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" People began to yell back at me, ""All lives matter!"" ""Get out of here!"" ""Boo! Trump! Trump! Trump!"" I wanted to tell them that of course ""all lives matter"" but that they weren’t dealing with the same struggles black people were — police brutality, an unfair justice system, generational poverty. The fact that our country has ignored our problems for too long. That we wouldn’t accept the status quo anymore. Look them in the eyes. Show no fear. Remember why you’re here. Oh — that must be the police touching me. I turned around, all the while yelling, ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" I couldn’t stop saying it. [Don’t criticize Black Lives Matter for provoking violence. The civil rights movement did, too.] Trump looked my way and yelled into the mic: ""Get out!"" The people I’d been sitting and talking with cheered with the rest of the crowd as police came over. Three officers grabbed me, and I heard cheering from all around. Maybe in other circumstances, I might have been afraid. But right then, I wasn’t. I didn’t have time to worry, and I most certainly couldn’t show it. I blocked everything out and kept chanting. Once we got to the top of the steps to exit my section, two officers trailed off and one continued to walk me to the door. He would eventually let me go, without any arrest, to the parking lot to meet the rest of the protesters and keep demonstrating outside the rally. On the way out, he pushed me pretty hard and tried several times to pull my fist from the air. ""Get your hands off of me, and stop pushing me right now. BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" ""Well, you need to keep walking."" ""I have not resisted since the moment you grabbed me. BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" I raised my fist back in the air. ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!"" A middle-aged white man in the crowd yelled at me: ""Get your little ass out of here! Go home, nigger!"" Don’t stop now, you’re almost at the door! Let them hear you! Don’t give up! ""BLACK LIVES MATTER!""","Trump looked my way and yelled into the mic: ""Get out!"" The people I’d been sitting and talking with cheered with the rest of the crowd as police came over."

New standards will be set for in-store signage and images will show children of both genders playing with the same toys. The change comes in response to a campaign from the group ""Let Toys Be Toys"" asking retailers ""to stop limiting children's imaginations and interests by promoting some toys as only suitable for girls, and others only for boys."" ""We’re delighted to be working so closely with a major toy retailer and believe that there is much common ground here,"" Megan Perryman, a Let Toys Be Toys campaigner, said in a press release. ""Even in 2013, boys and girls are still growing up being told that certain toys are ‘for’ them, while others are not. This is not only confusing but extremely limiting, as it strongly shapes their ideas about who they are and who they can go on to become. We look forward to seeing Toys 'R' Us lead the way to a more inclusive future for boys and girls."" Toys ""R"" Us has attempted to put aside stereotypes in the past. In 2012, the U.S.-based company's Swedish branch gained attention when images in its Christmas catalog challenged traditional gender roles. According to the Let Toys Be Toys release, other U.K. retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Boots, The Entertainer and TJ Maxx have agreed to remove ""boy"" and ""girl"" signs from their stores in response to the campaign. These stores join others in the U.K. that have already made efforts to end gender separation in toy departments. Last summer, Harrods unveiled a massive new toy department organized by theme instead of gender. Before that, Hamleys replaced its pink and blue signage with red and white. On this side of the pond, A Mighty Girl, a site that collects books, toys, movies, and music that empowers young girls, has started a Change.org petition to get Toys ""R"" Us stores here to jump on the bandwagon. ""By following their examples, Toys ""R"" Us in the USA can send an important message to children, parents, and others that children's interests should not be limited by their gender,"" the petition reads. And, GoldieBlox founder Debra Sterling has another plan to crush gender stereotypes at Toys ""R"" Us. In July, Sterling launched a campaign -- and an incredible video to go with it -- to get parents and kids to invade local stores and take pictures of girls playing with her building blocks.

But rather than selling the property, Kuester is opting to give it away for free. Sounds like a house hunter's dream come true, does it not? There is one slight catch, though. Whoever takes the home will need to take care of transporting it — and covering all moving charges, fees, permits and utility charges that result from doing so. That's because local developer Granville Homes is planning to build 28 brand new town homes on the plot on which Kuester's home currently sits. The house is very important to Kuester.

1338,"This has been by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life. I understood cognitively that I was facing a crossroads in my evolution as a player and as a man, and that it came with exceptionally difficult choices. What I didn’t truly understand, however, was the range of emotions I would feel during this process. The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player — as that has always steered me in the right direction. But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me.

There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career. I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community.

1341,"Maybe you, like me, decided at some point in your life that you'd had enough of soft drugs for a while. Whether this was the beginning of a smoke-free existence or just a hopeless case of hubris is irrelevant here; the point is that you stopped smoking weed for a bit. When you did, you probably also experienced a plethora of positive effects: You felt more energetic, found it easier to remember things, and stopped spending $20 a day on cheeseburgers and Doritos. A few days after I quit smoking weed for the first time, I started dreaming again and those dreams seemed more vivid than ever. I realized that as a stoner, I actually hardly ever dreamt at all, and that the few dreams I had weren't half as intense as my dreams these days. What's up with that? I decided to call Dr. Hans Hamburger, neurologist, somnologist (sleep expert), and head of Holland Sleep Research—a specialist research center for sleep disorders in the Netherlands. According to Hamburger, this resurgence of dreams is common among former smokers; weed suppresses your REM sleep. When you put your rolling papers, pipe, or vaporizers away for a while, your REM sleep suddenly gets the free rein it had before you became a superficially sleeping stoner Because I'm not a somnologist myself, I asked what REM sleep exactly is. ""Every night, you go through about four or five sleep cycles,"" Hamburger replied. ""Each cycle takes about ninety minutes, during which you go through different phases. There's superficial sleep, deep sleep, and finally REM sleep. During that REM period, you have most of your dreams. You don't usually remember your dreams if you continue sleeping. The last REM period just before you wake up takes the longest—and you'll only remember the dreams you had in that time if you wake up during it. If you don't wake up during the REM period, you won't remember a thing."" Does this mean you can't remember anything at all when you're sleeping? The answer seems to be no. ""You only remember the things that happen while you're awake,"" said Hamburger. ""We don't remember the things that happen while we are sleeping, because we're in a lowered state of consciousness. That has something to do with the fact that when you're asleep, you're processing the memories of things that happened during the day and essentially filing them away in your brain."" Dreams help you sort through the thousands of impressions and images you encounter every day. When you smoke weed regularly, that function is also suppressed. Dr. Hamburger confirms this: ""By smoking weed, you suppress the REM sleep, and with that you also suppress a lot of important functions of that REM sleep. One of those functions is reliving the things you have experienced and coming to terms with them, as it were. Processing all kinds of psychological influences is something you do in REM sleep. You also anticipate the things that will happen the next day or the days after that. While you're sleeping, you already consider those and make decisions in advance."" The less you give your brain the change to sort this shit out during REM sleep, the more dazed and confused you are during the day. This may explain why the seasoned stoner will often put off tasks and decisions until the very last minute: You failed to anticipate these issues properly, which is why you're late filing your taxes again, or can't remember where you left your house keys. Alcohol, surprisingly, has the opposite effect: If you go to bed shitfaced, the phases of REM sleep last longer. That is not to say that drinking two bottles of vodka before going to bed will help you get a good night's sleep. ""Too much alcohol suppresses the deep sleep and gives you more REM sleep, but it makes you more restless and wake up more often. If you drink way too much, you'll be twisting and turning all night and keep waking up,"" said Hamburger. Anyway, back to smoking weed. The effect pot has on your night's rest is clear. But why are your dreams so hyper-realistic and feverish after you stop smoking? ""If you've been taking a drug that suppresses a certain phenomenon for a while, then that phenomenon will come back stronger when you stop using that drug,"" explained Hamburger. ""That's what we call 'the rebound effect'—which is also noticeable in people who take a lot of sleeping pills. If they stop taking those, they often get very strange and intense dreams. That is also often the reason why people keep taking those sleeping pills—they become dependent on them, which is to say, addicted."" In other words: your body goes into sprint-dream-mode, and that is why your dreams are so intense. According to Hamburger, the body recovers from the rebound effect on its own over time. ""It is a temporary attempt to catch up on all the dreaming you missed when you were smoking weed. It usually goes away after two to three weeks,"" he said. ""Your body will know when it's all caught up and ready to go back to business as usual.""","According to Hamburger, this resurgence of dreams is common among former smokers; weed suppresses your REM sleep."
1342,"Marvel’s been an unstoppable force in the realm of superhero cinema, beginning in 2008 with Iron Man, and growing into the beastly expanded universe we have today. At every turn, it’s managed to bury its DC competitors (Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy excepted), and it’s made them the undisputed champions both critically and at the box office. But even through all this, the studio has always had an Achilles heel, centered around the fact that Marvel doesn’t actually own the movie rights to many of its own characters. Sony’s run of Spider-Man films pre-dates even the earliest days of the MCU. 20th Century Fox has been butchering the Fantastic Four since 2005, while its popular X-Men franchise goes all the way back to 2000. Recently though, Sony came to terms with Marvel Studios over the web-slinger, agreeing to share Spider-Man for the good of both operations. It paid off in spades in Captain America: Civil War, and soon Sony will get a fully Marvel-backed standalone film that’s almost guaranteed to make them huge piles of money. Given the relative success of Sony’s deal with Marvel, you can bet that the folks over at 20th Century Fox are intently watching. Matt Key, the producer on Kevin Smith’s ""Fatman on Batman"" podcast recently cited rumors that seem to confirm this too:    I’ve heard from a few of my sources, my little birds that Fox and Marvel have ... kind of talked, but not really, but like there’s interest from Fox, like, ""Oh, you know, what they did with Sony and Spider-Man is actually pretty cool, like, maybe ... "" We’re years away from that ever possibly happening ... but I think that’s what it would take ... Fox joining hands with Marvel. This is far from a guarantee of anything, but what it does show us is that Fox is standing up and taking notice of the success of Sony and Marvel’s Spider-Man team-up, a deal that benefits both sides. For Sony, it gets the backing of the MCU and the money that comes along with it. Marvel in turn gets to bring one of its most iconic heroes back into the fold, while assuming creative control over Sony’s standalone Spider-Man movies. Money-wise, Sony still gets to keep every dollar from its own Spidey films, and Marvel gets the same for any other MCU film that prominently features the web-slinger. Fox making a similar deal would make a whole lot of sense. X-Men: Apocalypse failed to impress at the box office, and netted the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score for the franchise since the unmitigated disaster that was X-Men Origins. And that’s not even going into the fact that the Fantastic Four have never quite clicked for Fox. Deadpool is the only superhero that’s managed to hit the mark for Fox in the meantime. So while we may be ""years away from that ever possibly happening,"" there’s no doubting that it would be a veritable shot in the arm for all of Fox’s superhero properties. A Fox/Marvel deal wouldn’t be entirely unprecedented either. The two studios recently came to terms over two separate spinoff TV series set in the X-Men universe, Hellfire and Legion. Whether that could lead to a much larger discussion about sharing the X-Men movie-verse is anyone’s guess, yet it still shows a willingness on both sides to come to the table and negotiate. When it comes down to brass tax, the best thing for 20th Century Fox would be sharing both X-Men and Fantastic Four. Hell, it even has a silver bullet in Deadpool that makes it so the studio would be coming from a solid bargaining position. Imagine an Infinity War movie that manages to incorporate Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen into the greater narrative? Or an X-Men movie set in a universe where both the Avengers and Inhumans exist? An agreement between the two studios opens up nigh infinite possibilities from a story perspective. When it comes to large-scale agreements like this would be, ""we’d get a really cool story"" isn’t what matters most to the people in charge. No, money is what talks, and an MCU with the X-Men would make a whole lot of it. Here we circle back to Sony’s Spider-Man deal. Tom Holland as Peter Parker was one of the many highlights of Civil War, but the real test will come when Spider-Man: Homecoming hits theaters next summer. When it inevitably makes a killing at the box office, there’s little doubt Fox will be watching closely. With two Marvel properties still in hand, 20th Century Fox has a whole lot to bring to the table for the MCU. A deal similar to Sony’s would only require folding its universe into Marvel’s, and frequently borrowing characters, all while Fox still gets to reap the rewards of standalone X-Men films. Basically, it’s a no-lose for all involved. It’s just up to the higher-ups at both studios to get it done, both for our benefit and, even more significantly, theirs.","This is far from a guarantee of anything, but what it does show us is that Fox is standing up and taking notice of the success of Sony and Marvel’s Spider-Man team-up, a deal that benefits both sides."
1345,"Are you someone who gives stellar relationship advice to your best friends, but can never seem to fix your own love life? You're not alone. Researchers from the University of Waterloo and University of Michigan set out to investigate whether or not people are actually better at giving advice to others than themselves. To test this, they conducted three studies using University of Michigan students involved in monogamous romantic relationships. The results were recently published in the journal Psychological Science. In the first study, 104 students were told to reflect on a scenario in which they were cheated on or their best friend was cheated on. The scenarios were assigned randomly. Researchers analyzed the responses and found that students who thought about their friend being cheated on scored higher in wise reasoning than students who were told to think about being cheated on themselves. Next, researchers set out to test if there was a way people could exhibit the same wisdom for their own problems as they did during conflicts involving friends. To do this, researchers recruited 120 new students. This time, using the same infidelity scenarios as before, participants were asked to work through the problem from either a first-person perspective using pronouns like ""I"" and ""me"" (""Why am I feeling this way?"") or a third-person perspective using first names and pronouns like ""he"" and ""she"" (""Why is Sally feeling this way?""). For the latter, even when reflecting on a scenario in which they themselves were cheated on, participants were encouraged to use their own names. By approaching the conflict from an outside perspective, participants exhibited better judgement and clearer thinking, even when the problem was their own. ""We are the first to demonstrate that there is a simple way to eliminate this bias in reasoning by talking about ourselves in the third person and using our name when reflecting on a relationship conflict,"" said study author Professor Igor Grossmann in a press release. ""When we employ this strategy, we are more likely to think wisely about an issue."" Lastly, researchers wanted to explore whether age would make a difference in one's ability to wisely assess personal conflict. For this, they recruited 469 U.S. adults ages 20 to 40 and 60 to 80. Regardless of age, researchers came to the same conclusion as before, writing, ""People displayed more wisdom when reasoning about a friend’s or family member's problem than when immersing into and reasoning about their own problems."" The takeaway? The trick to working through your own relationship problem is simply to pretend like it's someone else's.",talking about ourselves in the third person

Not only is Superman’s cousin a PlayStation 4 exclusive, her figure will only be available in Starter Packs, the full edition of the game most fans already own. One of my favorite things about Lego Dimensions up until this point was a distinct lack of platform-specific content. While Disney Infinity had retailer exclusive variants and Skylanders did the whole Wii/Wii U/3DS Nintendo crossover thing, Lego Dimensions was all out there, save for the odd convention circuit exclusive (I will have you, Green Arrow.) Starting late in September, Supergirl will come bundled alongside Batman, Wyldstyle and Gandalf in the PlayStation 4 Starter Pack for Lego Dimensions . What this means, is that if you already own a Starter Pack (which ran $99 at launch but have slipped down to around $60 or less lately), you’ll have to buy another one for Supergirl.

1357,"Most Americans are filled with regrets — financial regrets. Fully three in four, in fact, admit they harbor financial regrets, Fully three in four, in fact, admit they harbor financial regrets, according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults published Tuesday by Bankrate.com. Their biggest regret: not saving for retirement early enough (nearly one in five Americans put this in the No. 1 spot). What’s more, among those 65 and up, 27% said this was the biggest regret, compared with 17% of those aged 30 to 49. Indeed, it is costly to wait. A person who starts saving $300 a month for retirement at age 25 (assuming a 5% return on investment) will have about $450,000 saved by age 65, despite only contributing $144,000 into his retirement account. Meanwhile, if that person waits until 35 to save the same amount each month, he will contribute a total of $108,000 toward retirement but only have about $250,000 saved at age 65. ""If you don’t start saving early enough, you will start to notice that later,"" says Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. What’s more, waiting to save only exacerbates the problem of our already paltry nest eggs: According to 2015 data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, fully 28% of workers say they have less than $1,000 saved and 17% have between $1,000 and $9,999; meanwhile, just 14% of workers have $250,000 or more saved. © Provided by MarketWatch This is No. 1 financial regret of older Americans That’s far too little, according to many financial advisers: Guidelines from Fidelity, for example, state that by the age of 30, you should have your entire salary saved; by 40, three times your salary saved; and, by 50, six times your salary saved.",not saving for retirement early enough

1368,"Could advances in technology, genetics and artificial intelligence lead to a world in which economic inequality turns into biological inequality? asks the historian and writer Yuval Noah Harari. Inequality goes back at least 30,000 years. Hunter-gatherers were more equal than subsequent societies. They had very little property, and property is a pre-requisite for long-term inequality. But even they had hierarchies. In the 19th and 20th Centuries, however, something changed. Equality became a dominant value in human culture, almost all over the world. Why? It was partly down to the rise of new ideologies such as humanism, liberalism and socialism. But it was also about technological and economic change - which was connected to those new ideologies, of course. Suddenly the elite needed large numbers of healthy, educated people to serve as soldiers in the army and as workers in the factories. Governments didn't educate and vaccinate to be nice. They needed the masses to be useful. But now that's changing again. The best armies today require a small number of highly professional soldiers using very high-tech kit. Factories, too, are increasingly automated. This is one reason why we might - in the not-too-distant future - see the creation of the most unequal societies that have ever existed in human history. And there are other reasons to fear such a future. With rapid improvements in biotechnology and bioengineering, we may reach a point where, for the first time in history, economic inequality becomes biological inequality. Until now, humans had control of the world outside them. They could control the rivers, forests, animals and plants. But they had very little control of the world inside them. They had limited ability to manipulate and engineer their own bodies, brains and minds. They couldn't cheat death. That might not always be the case. There are two main ways to upgrade humans. Either you change something in their biological structure by changing their DNA. Or, the more radical way, you combine organic and inorganic parts - perhaps directly connecting brains and computers. The rich - through purchasing such biological enhancements - could become, literally, better than the rest; more intelligent, healthier and with far greater life-spans. At that point, it will make sense to cede power to this ""enhanced"" class. Think about it like this. In the past, the nobility tried to convince the masses that they were superior to everyone else and so should hold power. In the future I am describing, they really will be superior to the masses. And because they will be better than us, it will make sense to cede power and decision-making to them. We might also find that the rise of artificial intelligence - and not just automation - will mean that huge numbers of people, in all kinds of jobs, simply lose their economic usefulness. The two processes together - human enhancement and the rise of AI - may result in the separation of humankind into a very small class of super-humans and a massive underclass of ""useless"" people. Here's a concrete example. Think about the transportation market. You have thousands of lorry, taxi and bus drivers in the UK. Each of them commands a small share of the transportation market, and they gain political power because of that. They can unionise and if the government does something they don't like, they can go on strike and shut down the entire transportation system. Now fast-forward 30 years. All vehicles are self-driving. One corporation controls the algorithm that controls the entire transport market. All the economic power previously shared by thousands, and all their political power, is now in their hands of a single corporation. Once you lose your economic importance, the state loses at least some of the incentive to invest in your health, education and welfare. It's very dangerous to be redundant. Your future depends on the goodwill of some small elite. Maybe there is goodwill. But in a time of crisis - like climate catastrophe - it would be very easy to toss you overboard. Technology is not deterministic. We can still do something about all this. But I think we should be aware that what I'm describing is one possible future. If we don't like this possibility, we need to act before it's too late. There is one more possible step on the road to previously unimaginable inequality. In the short-term, authority might shift to a small elite that owns and controls the master algorithms and the data that feeds them. In the longer term, however, authority could shift completely from humans to the algorithms. Once AI is smarter than us, all humanity could be made redundant. What would happen after that? We have absolutely no idea. We literally can't imagine it. How could we? We are talking about an intelligence far greater than that which humanity currently possesses.","With rapid improvements in biotechnology and bioengineering, we may reach a point where, for the first time in history, economic inequality becomes biological inequality"

The casket is believed to be around 120 years old. The area was formerly Odd Fellows Cemetery. In the 1930s, the cemetery was relocated, and most of the bodies were excavated and reburied. However, not all of the remains were uncovered. Karner, being a mom herself, wanted to send the girl off correctly. She tried to take the coffin to be reburied, but the city would not give her a burial permit without the child’s death certificate.

1370,"Brexit Is What A Dark Age Feels Like. Here's Why. Elites in the West are in trouble. Their careful curation of the polity and economy is coming badly unstuck. Their credibility in delivering consumerist goodies is shattering. They have worked so assiduously to eliminate and denigrate all alternative social models that the frustration people now feel has no where to go, no reasoned idiom in which to express itself, so it comes out all over the place. This is what a dark age feels like. The only alternative grand narrative to the liberal market that withstood its celebratory march was nationalism. Especially after 9/11, nationalism of a particularly conservative kind was consistently mobilized by elites in the West in order to create the conditions for an aggressive foreign policy and as a complement to the panglossian idea that unfettered markets created the best of all worlds. Nationalism and neoliberalism were mutually reinforcing up to the point where capitalism continued to deliver the goodies. Once the goose stopped laying those eggs, this dynamic became antagonistic. This is what we are seeing today. There is an old trope in left politics that the working class fail to act and vote in their own interest thanks to the smoke-screen of nationalism. Workers of the postwar world failed to unite across national borders, and instead forged alliances with their own national elites, out of love for nation rather than their fellow workers spread across the world. The reality is more prosaic. These elites, fearing a leftward slide of their own working classes, were convinced to share some of the spoils of capitalism in the interest of maintaining their own hegemony and maintaining the social peace. Workers of the West took the deal, gaining the welfare state and steady employment in return. Nationalism served as a useful framing device for what was, at base, an inter-class alliance, one that survived as long as the economy delivered the goodies. In the course of this arrangement, something called ""economic growth"" became a common-sense, desirable thing. Yet, the obsession with growth on the part of those already rich, something we now appreciate as potentially world-ending, has a straightforward political root. In the absence of unceasing growth, the commitment to deliver more goodies to working people could only be make good through redistribution. If the pie isn't growing, the only way you can give a majority the larger slice you promised is by giving someone else a smaller one. And growth started to hit the rails in the 1970s with oil shocks, labour unrest, and general economic maturity after decades of postwar prosperity. Elites were faced with a stark choice: redistribute, or find another source of growth, quick. The solution they found was given the rosy name of ""globalization."" Moving the manufacturing sector, which tended to be powerfully unionized, overseas to ""emerging markets"" with authoritarian control over their own working people was the solution. It was the elites of the world who united. Those of East Asia benefited from access to lucrative Western markets and created their own growth miracles, while Western elites were able to discipline their working populations with the threat of outsourcing, even while restarting the growth engine through the delivery of cheaper-made goods and the import of well-behaved immigrants grateful for a chance to work in the West. New technology and a new geopolitics of oil assisted this new global arrangement. This was always a fudge. Western elites were just ""buying time,"" to quote German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck. The myth of a flexible labour force able to be retrained into the burgeoning service sector was just that: a myth. The legacy of postwar industrialism is a working class with no work; once proud industrial cities now turned to rust dot the north of England and the American midwest. The fix worked so long as capitalism delivered the goodies, first with cheaper goods, then with public debt, and most-recently with private debt that was delivered on a scale so far unimaginable thanks to developments in financial engineering and planet-sized pools of saving streaming in from East Asian growth. The Crisis of 2007 brought the latest fix to an end. Without the ability to pump out debt to a majority with chronically stagnant wages, Western elites could no longer deliver the goods to rustbelt populations. So convinced of their stranglehold on the polity, elites badly miscalculated the post-crisis clean-up by having the government bail out the banks - and then paying for the resulting ballooning in the deficit by slashing an already-bare-bones welfare state. They crashed the economy and made working people pay for it. The mask had slipped. The national pact now turned sour. Because the inter-class pact was forged in the language of nation, while other narratives went by the way side, the complaint at its shredding was also voiced in that language. It was not that years of low investment had decimated the welfare state; it was that immigrants were placing undue burdens on it, whatever the facts might say. The irony in the UK is that because of a lack of investment in domestic human capital, the UK has to import most of the labour that runs its National Health Service; the crown jewel of the welfare state is run by immigrants. Without growth, nationalism was the lone pillar on which the post-industrial order in the West could stand. And nationalism came to be the preserve of those left behind. Metropolitan elites, already spatially segregated from the rest of the country by astronomical housing prices in cities, sneer at the rest of the country as simply being another country. London, the south-east of the UK, and the American coasts are indeed plugged in to a different global order, one only nominally attached to the rest of the legacy nation-state. Those cities that successfully made the switch to globalized service industries developed a cosmopolitan, worldy ethic, while the rest were left to resent broken promises of strong national economies. Those left behind by the new settlement still had one last asset left, however - their vote. Their anger had to be managed. In adversarial political systems, their resentment could be exploited by political opportunists. It was precisely the fear that such opportunists would flank the Tories from the right that made David Cameron gamble on the referendum to begin with. The gambit was to meant to give vent to the issue - and then squash it at least for a generation. That it failed, albeit narrowly, is again testament to how elites, cosseted and isolated in their world cities, can make serious errors of judgement. Needles to say, Trump is testing the Republican political establishment in much the same way. Nations are political units but increasingly, they are not economic ones. World cities are connected to developing-nation industrial belts and resource-rich hinterlands in other nations to form a global economic order on its own. Elites from across the world coordinate in ever-deeper ways. Cutting across this global economic order is the vestigial grid of nation states. This contradiction between national polities and global economies will continue to throw up earthquakes like Brexit. The elite-run press wail at the death of reasonable discourse, the failure of experts to convince the public with technocratic arguments, the perfidy of opportunists who weaponize peoples' misery with sheer lies. Yet the simple truth is that reasoned arguments never held the political order together; this was always a liberal myth. The order held together because it delivered the consumerist goodies. And it could only continue to deliver by means of increasingly-fragile fudges. These are now over. People want a new order in which a sense of belonging and a sense of security, nationalism and economics, go together. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this democratic desire. At base, this is what this vote is about. The British people are of course not alone in this search. In searching for a vision in which nations can be economically strong in a connected world, some opportunists will pair up with genuinely racist elements to make political capital. But to see this as merely the resurgence of some archaic, parochial, provincial populism is to miss the wood for the trees. The saddest irony of this vote, however, is that although the underlying impulse is a democratic one, the result will be anything but. Eurocrats will want to punish the UK in order to make an example of it, while British elites themselves will now double down on the slash-and-burn of the welfare state in the name of boosting the economy. Unchecked by the remnants of European social democracy and with the Labour party in shambles, the right-wing of the Tory party will sense that it has the field to itself. The resulting economic pain will of course only further incense those already angry. With the nationalist card now played, the stage is set for old-fashioned class war in one country.

Even worse, your paychecks get divided pretty evenly between rent, food and student loan payments. Understandably, you haven't bothered to start a retirement fund yet — you're only 23! You have 39 years before you need to even start worrying about retirement, right? Wrong. We spoke with Dan Egan, director of behavioral finance and investments at Betterment, and Qapital founder and CEO George Friedman about why every young adult needs to be planning their financial future — and why it's so difficult. ""The 20s are a crucial time to start building wealth and saving for retirement,"" Egan said. ""The younger you start investing, the more you can reap the benefits of compounding and long-term market gains. Additionally, at this age, you can afford to invest more aggressively and take on a little more risk in order to earn better returns."" When asked how much a person should set aside, Egan said that it varies by situation. However, he would give everyone the same advice. ""The simple answer: save more. If you aren’t able to contribute substantial amounts of your salary yet, it’s most important to just get in the game,"" he said. ""Once you’re in a stable position in your life and career, committing at least 20 percent of your annual income (including retirement savings) to your investment portfolio is the way to go."" It is hugely important for young people to be planning for their futures, but very few of them do. A survey from Scottrade found that 64 percent of millennials haven't even begun to think about retirement. This graph from J.P. Morgan illustrates the earning potential your investments have. A graph showing the earning potential of retirement investments Image: J.p. Morgan asset management It shows that a 10-year delay in putting away money for retirement can be impossible to make up. Chloe, who starts investing at age 25, will make $950,588 more than Lyla, who had the exact same investment plan, but started at age 35. Chloe only invested $100,000 more than Lyla. Putting away money early in your career is obviously a sacrifice. Every dollar being put in a retirement account is a dollar not being used to buy the next round or to see that new band coming to town. Those are sacrifices that are important now, so that you don't have to make tougher sacrifices when you get older. ""It might seem like a sacrifice to save 20 percent of your income right now,"" he acknowledged.

While that does sound like a lot of money, it goes fast once you're in the real world. One 2014 grad, who asked to remain anonymous, told Mashable, ""I feel like my life has no chance of truly being stress-free until my student loans are paid off."" Qapital CEO George Friedman advised recent grads who don't know where to start to put a system in place, regardless of how much they were able to set aside. ""Start by focusing on getting into the right habit, you can up the amounts later on. Really, just do it, even if you start with only $100 a month,"" he said. ""At Qapital, we see many first-time savers who automate it for small amounts and before they know it, have significant amounts stacked up for anything from a down payment for a house to a summer festival ticket, or a first large chunk toward a retirement fund."" We asked Friedman how much of a difference a few years will really make. ""A huge difference,"" he said. ""That is because the money you put aside at the start will have a really long time to grow, thanks to compound interest. It’ll also hurt less if you go easy at the start and start saving small, instead of trying to play catch-up with large amounts later on."" Friedman also said that young workers shouldn't let loans or debt stop them from planning ahead. ""Waiting to save until you’re debt-free could be a long way away. Just because you have loans to pay off, doesn't mean you can't make smart financial choices for your future. The earlier you start saving for retirement, the more time your money will have to grow. And, with the right plan, you’ll pay off your debts along the way."" So, there you have it. Start saving now.","By saving as much as you can while there are fewer demands on your income, you put yourself ahead"

'They would say to me ""I'm doing all the right things Jess, but my sugar cravings are non-stop and I can’t seem to lose the weight!"". I started noticing a pattern,' she explained.

'Caffeine can cause weight gain or make it very difficult to lose weight. This is because caffeine can have a direct impact on your stress levels (cortisol) and blood sugar balance, which in turn affects weight balance. Cortisol makes it very difficult to lose weight,' she explained. 'Also, some people are having coffee the wrong way – with too much milk (a large double latte!) and too many added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Ms Sepel said those who are struggling to lose weight may need to reassess when and how they have their coffee. She also added that caffeine can stay in the system for eight hours which can disrupt sleep and therefore lead to unhealthy cravings. The nutritionist concluded by advising people to stick to just one coffee a day and to have it before 10am with food.  'Enjoy that 1 cup a day. I sip my coffee slowly and enjoy each sip! I drink it so mindfully which makes me feel so satisfied,' she said. ",Caffeine can cause weight gain or make it very difficult to lose weight
1377,"Still, crystals are big business, with celebrities leading the trend. Madonna and Khloe Kardashian swear by them, and Katy Perry reportedly slept with one in her hand after splitting from ex-hubby Russell Brand. I entered this world of mystical energy and sparkling rocks in hopes of understanding a practice that’s become popular among celebrities and regular folks alike: Using crystals like amethysts, emeralds and rose quartz to harness healing power. It’s a practice that elicits raised eyebrows and concern in the medical community, as there’s no solid research proving crystals work — and even some devotees acknowledge any positive vibes are probably just a placebo effect. If I breathe too deeply, will the crystals fall off my rib cage, I wonder? What if I fall asleep mid healing session? Will that send my chakras into a spiritual tailspin? In a soothing voice, Lesia Yacht , the Toronto-based crystal healer conducting my session, tells me to let my mind wander. Instead, during the hour or so I’m lying motionless, I am acutely aware of my stomach grumbling and every sudden itch on my forehead. I’m in the basement of Happy Soul , a metaphysical shop on Bloor St. W., laying face-up on a table with my eyes shut and my shoes off. Calming music fills the small mauve room — pan flute, I think to myself — while a crystal healer places cool crystals one-by-one at my feet, up my stomach and chest, on my throat, my forehead and above my head. Each one aligns with a chakra, the seven energy points throughout the body, according to some Indian religions, Tibetan Buddhism and New Age thinking. ""Our revenue is over seven figures annually,"" says founder Diana House, over the phone from her office in London, Ont., where a large citrine crystal in on display. ""I believe that it helps,"" House says, referring to the roughly $1,000 crystal, known for its ‘prosperity and abundance’ properties. ""But I can’t scientifically prove it does anything,"" she adds. Hipster troubadour Father John Misty is selling some in his merch store — rose quartz earrings for $45, in case you were wondering — and you can also find them anywhere from local metaphysical shops to Urban Outfitters. Before our healing crystal session, Yacht told me certain crystals can ""unblock"" various energy points and help manifest your desires. ""If all our energy centres are open, we will be healthy all the way around,"" she says. Fan websites say the sparkling stones are rooted in ancient healing rituals and act as conduits for wellness in the mind, body and spirit, channelling positive energy to improve someone’s well-being, and can be worn around your neck, held during meditation sessions, or placed throughout a room. Marta Borowski, 31, credits a crystal with helping her buy a house in Toronto’s fiercely competitive real estate market. After she and her fiancé lost a bidding war, she passed a store showcasing a massive gemstone collection and decided a crystal ""good luck charm"" could come in handy. ""I don’t know if it was the sunstone, but we ended up getting our dream home,"" she says. Borowski thinks it’s about visualization, and perhaps a placebo effect. ""Somebody could give you a piece of cloth and say, ‘This cloth holds some kind of energy creating properties,’ and you would just harness all of your positive energy into that and it would have the same effect,"" she says. And there really isn’t any concrete research backing up the positive vibes beyond this power of suggestion. ""Sadly, the whole of complementary and alternative medicine can be summed up as ‘popular in the face of no evidence,’"" says Christopher French, head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at the Goldsmiths, University of London department of psychology. French researched healing crystals to figure out why people think they work, and presented his results at a couple of conferences in the early 2000s. In his study, 80 participants were asked to meditate while holding either a real crystal or a fake one they were told was real. Before meditating, half the total number of participants were primed on what types of sensations to expect — things like tingling, heat, a mood boost, and so on. The result? People who were primed on crystal sensations beforehand reported much stronger sensations than those who weren’t. On top of that, there was no major difference in what people felt while holding real versus fake crystals. ""The results of our study did not come as any great surprise,"" French tells me. ""The power of suggestion to affect perception and memory has been demonstrated in literally thousands of well-controlled psychological experiments for many decades."" But if you can think of an issue, fans say there’s a crystal for it. Want to bring clarity to your mind? Try selenite. Want to stimulate your immune system? Buy some clear quartz. This concerns French. ""It is sometimes argued that this is acceptable, as if a person feels better after a worthless treatment, surely that’s a good thing?"" he says. ""But the danger here is that people may rely on worthless (complementary and alternative medicine) treatments for problems that might have been effectively treated with conventional medicine in the early stages but not seek the latter until it is too late."" In other words: Don’t try curing cancer with a crystal. The crystal fans I spoke to for this story agreed. ""It’s a holistic way of healing, but never to replace (medicine),"" Yacht says. Back at Happy Soul, after my own crystal healing experience — one that typically costs $85 and lasts around 75 minutes — I felt tranquil, like a weight was off my shoulders. But was that because Yacht unblocked my ""two"" blocked chakras using the mystical power of the crystals covering my body? Or did I simply doze off to the sound of pan flute?",no solid research proving crystals work — and even some devotees acknowledge any positive vibes are probably just a placebo effect.

1381,"Three-time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson is retiring from acting, this according to a new report from RadarOnline. The site claims that Nicholson has ""quietly retired"" from Hollywood on account of memory issues associated with aging. Nicholson turned 76 this past April. HuffPost Entertainment has reached out to Nicholson's representatives for comment on the RadarOnline.com report, and this post will be updated if and when they respond. UPDATE: While no one from Nicholson's camp has provided an official response, E! Online quotes Maria Shriver as saying the news of Nicholson's retirement is false. The original story continues below. If this marks the end of Nicholson's illustrious acting career, that would make the 2010 flop ""How Do You Know"" his last feature film. That romantic comedy reunited Nicholson with director James L. Brooks, with whom Nicholson worked with previously on ""Terms of Endearment,"" ""Broadcast News"" and ""As Good As It Gets."" Two of Nicholson's three Academy Awards came from those Brooks films: He won Best Supporting Actor at the 1984 Oscars for ""Terms of Endearment"" and Best Actor at the 1998 Oscars for ""As Good As It Gets."" Nicholson's other Best Actor award came for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" at the 1976 ceremony. Overall, Nicholson has received 12 Oscar nod in his career thus far, making him the most nominated actor in Hollywood history. His last nomination came for the 2002 film ""About Schmidt."" Whether the report of Nicholson's retirement is true or not, the 76-year-old has slowed down his pace considerably in recent years. Beyond ""How Do You Know,"" he's only starred in four other films since 2003: ""Anger Management,"" ""Something's Gotta Give,"" ""The Departed"" and ""The Bucket List.""

1384,"Even among tech companies, whose product announcements are geared to be grandiose, Elon Musk's Mars-colonization rollout feels like something new. In a video shared Tuesday at a space exploration conference in Guadalajara, Musk outlined his plan: Before this century is out, a small team of humans will open a spacecraft door, step onto red ground and stare at the sun faintly shining through Mars’ hazy atmosphere. A few years later, more people will arrive, but the planet that greets them will look increasingly familiar. Mars will be swaddled in clouds, and the same watery blue that characterizes Earth. The journey will begin on Launch Pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center, where Apollo 11 lofted humans to another world for the first time. Only now, the patron will not be a global superpower, but SpaceX. Musk unveiled his plans at an annual gathering of the International Astronautical Federation, a group founded during the Cold War. A self-sustaining, shining city on Mars would need about 1 million people, according to Musk, who envisions launching 1,000 ships to get them there. The goal is to become a multi-planetary species, ensuring humanity could survive an extinction event on Earth. The first flights could leave for Mars by 2022, he claims. ""This is about minimizing existential risk and having a sense of adventure. It’s about ensuring the light of consciousness is not extinguished, which I think is really important. ... The probable lifespan of human civilization will be much greater if we are a multi-planetary species,"" he said. ""But the argument I find most compelling is it would be an incredible adventure. Life needs to be more than solving problems every day. You need to wake up and be inspired."" The first Martians would be wealthy people, presumably the sort who possess both a pioneering spirit and a knack for construction. Musk hopes to lower the cost of a trip to Mars to roughly the median price of a house in the U.S., about $200,000, he said. The first settlers would build pressurized dome shelters on Mars, to protect them from Mars’s harsh climate and tenuous atmosphere. Larger domes would be built to harbor farms capable of feeding a population of one million. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to ship thousands of people per year to the Red Planet. They would travel using the newly announced Interplanetary Transport System, which consists of a 40-foot-diameter rocket booster and 55-foot-diameter spaceship, codenamed the BFR and BFS, respectively (yes, those acronyms mean what you think they mean). Initially, Musk referred to his ship as the Mars Colonial Transporter, but earlier this month he said he was ditching that name, because the the rocket will be built to go beyond Mars. On Tuesday, he even invoked Europa, a moon of Jupiter that probably has an enormous ocean under its surface. ""It’s got to be fun and exciting. It can’t feel cramped or boring ... it will be, like, really fun to go."" In the soaring promo video SpaceX unveiled Tuesday, the rocket lifts off and the ship heads to a ""parking orbit"" while the booster sails back to Earth, landing straight up on the same launchpad. There, it will pick up a new fuel tank and launch itself again, joining the spaceship in orbit and gassing it up for the trip to Mars. It would repeat this three to five times. Fueling the ship off Earth would dramatically lower costs, Musk said. The ship resembles a multi-decker space shuttle, but without the iconic delta wings. Instead, once in orbit, it unfurls a pair of wing-like solar panels, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. The ship, made from carbon fiber, would accommodate at least 100 passengers and maybe up to 200, Musk said. It is gigantic, and could even have room for on-board eateries: ""Pizza joints, you name it,"" he said. It would have giant windows in its nose to ensure dazzling views. ""It’s got to be fun and exciting. It can’t feel cramped or boring,"" he said. ""It will be, like, really fun to go."" While this all sounds like science fiction, Musk is already working on the engine that could make this happen. A few days ago, he tweeted the first glimpse of the Raptor, a powerful engine that can deliver about 500,000 pounds of thrust. It will use liquid methane for fuel, unlike both the Falcon 9 rockets and the space shuttle main engines. This is a strategic choice: While scientists are still hunting for signatures of methane at Mars, it can certainly be manufactured there, using ice and carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere. The Raptor boosts the ship to a cruising speed of about 63,000 mph. After an interplanetary coast lasting several months, the ship will dive toward Mars, gradually tipping up its nose to skid downward in the same manner the space shuttle used to reenter Earth’s atmosphere. The craft’s heat shield will reach temperatures upward of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A few moments before landing, the vehicle will stand upright, just like SpaceX rockets do now, and unfold three legs to balance itself, finally perching on the ground. Along with safely delivering colonists, the BFR and its attendant ship would have to deliver 100 tons of payload to Mars, which is 100 times larger than the heaviest thing humans have ever sent to the red planet. Landing may be an even bigger challenge than launching; Curiosity, our biggest Mars rover, weighs 1,982 pounds, and needed a combination of parachutes and an audacious, specially designed sky crane to touch down safely. There is almost no room for error in a landing like this; if one thruster misfires, or something goes wrong with the powered descent, the ship will collapse into the dirt. Mars’s atmosphere isn’t thick enough for parachutes to serve as backup. Even the journey’s midpoint is treacherous. Earth’s magnetic field deflects the worst of solar and cosmic radiation, and even then, humans visiting low Earth orbit are exposed to ionizing radiation that can damage DNA and cause cancer. Once humans leave Earth’s protective cocoon, they will be exposed to dangerous cosmic rays and solar flares. A colonial transport would also likely have to provide some kind of artificial gravity, or at least good enough exercise equipment that astronauts won’t be bed-bound the minute they land. There will be too much work to do to spend weeks recovering and regaining enough muscle and bone density to walk. Musk admitted that the funding structure for his grand plan is pretty unclear: ""Steal underpants, launch satellites, send cargo and astronauts to ISS, Kickstarter, profit,"" he joked.","Musk outlined his plan: Before this century is out, a small team of humans will open a spacecraft door, step onto red ground and stare at the sun faintly shining through Mars’ hazy atmosphere"
1389,"Along with giving up smoking and cutting down on booze, there’s another thing you should be giving priority to this year: sorting out problems with your sex life that never seem to go away. Make this the year you get rid of the things you regularly squabble about – once and for all – with these simple but effective therapist-approved techniques. But first, take this split-second test to determine if your sex life could really be in trouble... Scroll down for Tracey's four sex solutions: Can you name the top three places your partner loves to be touched? Come on, right off the top of your head, without even thinking about it, list off your partner’s three hot zones. If you don’t know the answer or spend the next few hours struggling to even come up with one or two, your sex life could be in trouble. Let’s be honest here: if you don’t even know what areas they’d most like stimulated, what chance have you got of being the best lover they ever had?  Truly brilliant lovers also realise these zones can change according to mood, time of month, stress levels, how tired/happy/drunk we are. Then, of course, there are female ‘fat days’ to contend with (even supermodels have them). Stroking that secret spot just below her belly button may well make her sigh on thin days, but go anywhere near her stomach when she’s feeling blah/bloated/full up/periody/in the grips of PMT hell and you’re likely to get a very different reaction. And that’s putting it nicely.  1. The magnet method If your problem is a sex frequency mismatch, this works a treat. The main aim is to stop the ‘Do they/Don’t they want sex?’ daily dilemma which has both of you circling each other, sniffing the air for clues.  It requires zero effort and it’s great for couples that don’t feel comfortable discussing their sexual needs (you’d still be far better off if you did, mind you!) You need two fridge magnets, easily distinguishable from each other. Each of you claim a magnet then move it once a day depending on if you do or don’t feel like sex. If the magnet is close to the top of the fridge, it means you’re extremely interested; if it’s at the bottom, you’d rather be filling in your tax return. There’s a temptation for the high sex person to leave their magnet at the top of the fridge permanently and the low-desire person to weld theirs to the bottom but you’re actually better off doing the opposite. If both of you try to resist your ‘natural’ inclination and deliberately hover in neutral territory (the middle of the fridge), you might find an interesting pattern emerges. The low-desire person - albeit nervously and tentatively – (finally) gets to be the first to instigate sex by inching their magnet above the always-up-for-it person, experiencing a hypnotic twinge of sexual power. The high desire person (finally) gets the equally exquisite glory of being seduced. Some couples keep the magnets on the fridge forever, others find after a few months it’s removed the pressure to the point they’re happy verbalizing their needs. 2. The I’m-in-charge libido booster If you’re arguing over who does or doesn’t initiate sex, try this program (for the person who doesn’t initiate). During the program, your partner remains passive when you initiate sexual contact. Make it clear they’re not to take it further: simply accept and enjoy what you’re doing to them. It’s important you spell this out or they’ll take over and you’re back to square one! They also need to give you permission to stop when you want. Lots of low libido people are too scared to start something, in case they don’t want to follow through, so avoid even kissing their partner because they know they’ll be badgered for sex when all they fancied was a cuddle. The idea is to get you to relish being the one in control rather than lying back and relying on them to do everything for you. Initiation sessions don’t need to be long or include intercourse or an orgasm for one or both of you – just involve something sexy.  3. The five-minute clock If you find your arguments seem to go round and round in circles with neither of you really listening to the other, this simple solution can make all the difference. All you need is the stopwatch on your phone and a quiet place to talk. The next time you argue, instead of both talking over each other, set the clock for five minutes and try this. One of you gets to speak while the other stays completely silent and listens intently, trying as much as possible not to react emotionally to what’s being said. When the five minutes is up, the listener repeats back what they think they’ve just been told. This ensures you actually do listen, rather than spend the time planning what you’re going to say when it’s your turn! Repeating it back also ensures you really have understood what they were trying to say, rather than what you think you heard. We all use the same words to mean different things and if you got it wrong, they get the chance to set you right. Keep going until both of you are totally satisfied you got the message then the other person gets a turn. This will alleviate stress and resentment in the relationship - which can only help boost your sex life.  4. A lusty lucky dip I’ve used this technique successfully on lots of long-term couples who want to add sexual spice. It works a treat because, while it does involve the dreaded ‘P’ word (planning), once you’ve done the initial exercise, it’s spontaneous sex from that point on. Ready? Grab a pen and paper and both of you write down 10 new things you’d like to try. You can do it there and then or give yourselves a good week to do this properly. Don’t think about what you think your partner will agree to, focus on what you’d like, aiming for a mix of simple ideas to those which take more effort and the not-so-naughty right through to outright wicked! Once you’ve both completed your lists, swap and go through and approve or disapprove each other’s suggestions. Most couples end up with about 6 or 7 on each list they’re both happy to try and compromise on the rest. It’s fine to say no to a suggestion, just be prepared to give specific reasons why you don’t want to try something.  Now rip up the sheets so each suggestion can be folded solo, place them all in a jar and shake them up. Once a week from now on, one of you picks a slip of paper from the jar and does whatever it says. The joy of the lusty lucky dip is that both of you feel safe – you know it’s something you’re happy to try - but since you have no idea which of the ideas will be pulled out, it’s unpredictable as well.

1395,"The Paris Summer Innovation Fellowship boasts of bringing together ""bright young minds"" and granting them the resources to achieve great goals. This year, they stretched the ""young"" label a little farther by accepting a 10-year-old girl. Kat Borlongan, a founding partner of Five by Five, the organization hosting the fellowship, posted an open letter on Facebook to the young applicant. She said that the young girl, Eva, had impressed the team with her bravery and fearlessness. She first summarized Eva’s pitch: ""The streets of Paris are sad. I want to build a robot that will make them happy again. I’ve already start[ed] learning how to code on Thymio robots, but I have trouble making it work. I want to join the program so the mentors can help me."" ""The answer is yes,"" Borlongan told Eva in the public note. ""You have been selected as one of Paris’ first-ever Summer Innovation Fellows among an impressive pool of candidates from all across the world: accomplished urban designers, data scientists and hardware specialists. I love your project and agree that more should be done—through robotics or otherwise—to improve Paris’ streets and make them smile again."" Borlongan said that she was moved by Eva’s passionate and bold proposal. ""There was nothing on the website that said the program was open to 10 year olds but—as you must have noticed—nothing that said that it was not,"" she said. ""You’ve openly told us that you had trouble making the robot work on your own and needed help. That was a brave thing to admit, and ultimately what convinced us to take on your project."" The letter also clarifies that Eva will be able to receive help from the Thymio team whose robots she mentioned she worked on. In fact, Borlongan noted that the group’s president will assist Eva in the fellowship, and she will also receive a new robot to go with it. In the end, Borlongan shares a lesson that everyone can take to heart: ""Humility and the willingness to learn in order to go beyond our current limitations are at the heart and soul of innovation."" She added, ""It is my hope that your work on robotics will encourage more young girls all over the world—not just to code, but to be as brave as you, in asking for help and actively looking for different ways to learn and grow.""",want to build a robot that will make them happy again.

Three-year-old Chloe had successfully walked down the aisle as the flower girl in a family friend's wedding and behaved herself at the reception – a feat for any toddler, let alone one whose behavior had been unpredictable as of late. Her proud parents ordered the mocktail as a reward. They regret it now. ""She went from excited and happy to be there and wanting to dance, to flailing her arms and having a major tantrum,"" recalls Chloe's mom, Bobbi Cunningham, a clinical social worker in New York. ""We barely made it out of there in one piece."" In all, it took about a year for the family to pinpoint the culprit of Chloe's outbursts that mostly occurred during ostensibly happy occasions such as birthday parties, In all, it took about a year for the family to pinpoint the culprit of Chloe's outbursts that mostly occurred during ostensibly happy occasions such as birthday parties, holidays and family outings to the movies or the circus. It wasn't attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , the terrible twos or childhood depression ; it was an intolerance to Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 – three artificial colors that make up about 90 percent of all food dyes, estimates a report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit that advocates for safer, healthier foods. ""As soon as I stopped all those dyes, she began to sleep better, she looked better [and] she wasn't so irritable. She was just more relaxed and easygoing,"" says Cunningham, who began to make the connection after her daughter swallowed piece after piece of gum containing some of the dyes and other artificial flavorings. Chloe's pediatrician then referred them to an allergist/immunologist, who agreed Chloe's behavior changes were a ""clear indication"" of the dyes' ""toxic nature,"" Cunningham recalls, although there's no test for food dye sensitivities. He wrote a note that Chloe could use at school to avoid the dyes instead. Tossing about 70 percent of the foods in the family's dry food pantry to clear it of dyes, Cunningham says, ""was really quite a change for her – and us."" Food-dye intolerance affects less than 1 percent of adults and 2 to 7 percent of people with allergies, according the Food-dye intolerance affects less than 1 percent of adults and 2 to 7 percent of people with allergies, according the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology , which doesn't estimate how many children are affected. (While there are thousands of additives in our food supply, only a few seem to cause reactions, ACAAI reports.) Most experts agree that such sensitivities may manifest in children's behavior – particularly if the children are already susceptible to behavioral problems like ADHD – but stronger research is needed to be sure. The colorful additives' links to everything from cancer to autism, however, are more controversial – but they're no less on the minds of Americans, says Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and food scientist in the District of Columbia. Her clients have asked her whether they should cut out dyes to reduce their risk of cancer or to eat more naturally, although they can't always articulate exactly why they're worried. ""Most of the time,"" Dubost says, ""people want to be natural – whatever that means to them."" Colors of Controversy It's not just green bagels, Fruit Loops and Gatorade that are colored by artificial food dyes – some salad dressings, It's not just green bagels, Fruit Loops and Gatorade that are colored by artificial food dyes – some salad dressings, vitamins , pickles and even white frosting contain them too, says Lisa Lefferts, a senior scientist who focuses on food additives at CSPI, the consumer advocacy organization. Makeup, contact lenses and cough syrup can also be tinted with the dyes, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which regulates color additives. ""Places where you'd never expect to find them, you can find them,"" Lefferts says. Is that so bad? According to Lefferts, yes. She points to studies compiled in her organization's recent Is that so bad? According to Lefferts, yes. She points to studies compiled in her organization's recent report – called ""Seeing Red"" – suggesting that behavioral problems may be reduced when certain food dyes are removed from some children's diets. Just this week, CSPI submitted a letter – including more than 2,000 complaints from parents – urging the FDA to require warning labels on foods that contain synthetic dyes. ""Sometimes the kid has been medicated or diagnosed with ADHD or other problems, and simply by eliminating dyes, they can solve the problem,"" says Lefferts, whose organization estimates that about a half-million children who've been diagnosed with ADHD are susceptible to food-dye sensitivities. ""What an unnecessary tragedy because a lot of parents don't find out."" Cunningham worries about misdiagnoses, too, noting that Cunningham worries about misdiagnoses, too, noting that ADHD medications themselves may contain dyes that can contribute to outbursts. Parents may misattribute behavioral issues to the wrong dietary culprit, too. ""So many people think their kids are reacting to sugar,"" Cunningham says, ""but always this dye is the shadow behind the sugar."" But the reverse may be true too, says Joshua Lambert, an associate professor of food science at Pennsylvania State University. ""A lot of these artificial food dyes occur in sugary beverages and high-energy-dense foods,"" he says, ""and it's not always clear [in studies] how well those things were controlled for."" Even so, color additives are hardly necessary, Lefferts argues. ""It's not like this is some lifesaving drug that we're willing to put up with some downsides,"" she says. ""It's color – and you can get color another way."" Try adding pesto to your deviled eggs for a St. Patrick's Day-themed twist, she suggests. For adults, food-dye risks are mostly limited to those with For adults, food-dye risks are mostly limited to those with allergies or sensitivities to them – sometimes in the form of skin reactions like hives, according to the ACAAI. But there have been reports of adults going into severe anaphylactic shock due to a color additive that comes from dried bugs. While some animal research has suggested that certain dyes may have carcinogenic effects, those in our food supply either aren't among them or are regulated so that they'll never reach potentially cancerous levels, Dubost says. Like anything, ""the poison is in the dose,"" she says. Still, choosing fruit punch over all-natural coconut water won't do your health any favors, Lefferts says. ""Dyes are often used in heavily processed foods that have low nutritional value,"" Lefferts says, ""so by avoiding the dyes, you'll probably also be avoiding some foods that just aren't good for you anyway."" 'We Eat With Our Eyes' Other science and nutrition experts aren't so sure artificial dyes are worth the worry for kids and adults who aren't sensitive to them​. ""If we don't have a good understanding of whether they have adverse effects or not, and [we don't] do the studies to show that they do or don't, we run the risk of worrying about things when we should be worrying about something else,"" Lambert says. Fretting about the dye in festive green beer is a case in point.

1408,"Jeff Bezos said trying to get to Mars before going back to the moon is an ""illusion."" Speaking at the JFK Space Summit in Boston on Wednesday, Bezos talked about his ambitions to establish a settlement on the moon with his space exploration company Blue Origin. Previously, Bezos has said he wants the company to build a ""sustained human presence"" there. He said setting up any kind of permanent settlement on the moon would require collaboration between numerous companies and probably multiple governments. ""What I really hope is that we stick with going back to the moon, this time to stay, because that is actually the fastest way to get to Mars. It's an illusion that you can skip a step. Skipping steps slows you down, it's seductive but wrong,"" said Bezos. The Amazon CEO elaborated by saying that it would be theoretically easier to propel bulk materials from the moon than the Earth, due to its low gravity. ""If you're gonna need a lot of supplies and fuel and bulk materials to go to Mars, you're much better lifting them off the moon than you are lifting them off the Earth. It's a gigantic lever,"" he said. ""Go to the moon, get yourself set up there. Mine propellants there. Build a fuel depot there,"" he said. Bezos has previously said the Blue Origin lunar lander — Blue Moon — is designed to be fuelled by hydrogen and oxygen partially because that means it could use reserves of ice, which can be found in lunar craters. His comments could be seen as an attack on fellow tech billionaire and space-colonization hopeful Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX's ambition is to fly humans to Mars and eventually settle them there. The pair have exchanged numerous barbs over their space race. When launching Blue Moon last month, Bezos' slides included a reference to Musk's red planet mission, suggesting that the moon is the more realistic ambition. Musk hit back by comparing Bezos' lunar lander to male genitals. The moon isn't entirely off SpaceX's radar, in February it flew the first ever private lunar mission to place an Israeli lander on the surface of the moon. The mission was a failure, as the lander's main engine failed causing it to crash. SpaceX is also planning to launch the first tourist flight around the back of the moon in 2023, and named its first passenger Yusaku Maezawa back in September. Musk's sights have long been set on the red planet, however, and SpaceX has been developing Mars rockets at a launch site in South Texas since 2014.","Go to the moon, get yourself set up there.

This was not a fb friend, but someone who subscribes to my website newsletter ( christinelavin.com ). So I told her a true story I’ve known about Trump since 1994. An actor friend of mine worked for a caterer in 1993. It was a new caterer, and this caterer was thrilled to land the kind of job that can really boost a career — catering Donald Trump and Marla Maples wedding. At the time she wondered why he didn’t hire other caterers he’d used in the past, but just thanked her lucky stars he hired her. Everything went beautifully — the food was a hit, the waiters/waitresses all were totally professional. Everything was first rate. Donald Trump refused to pay the bill. He told the caterer, ""I know you are new at this, and when you tell people you catered MY wedding, you will get more business than you could ever dream of. So I am doing you a favor. And when I do favors, I don’t pay. End of discussion."" She couldn’t believe it — she sent numerous bills — ignored. She threatened to sue — he said ""Go ahead. I don’t lose in court."" She explored suing, but came away knowing it would cost her high legal bills, and wouldn’t be worth it. After more than six months of his stonewalling she ended up paying her staff out of her own pocket, though couldn’t pay them fully or she’d be out of business. So Trump stiffed not only her, but her staff, her chefs, her busboys. This is not a story I recently heard — it’s one I heard 22 years ago. We know many stories like this now. The woman who wrote to me today said, ""I know you have a big heart and won’t hold it against me, but I wanted you to know I’m 100% for Trump."" I wrote back, ""I may have a big heart, but it’s not that big. Goodbye."" Should she write back to chastise me more, her email will go straight to the trash where it belongs.

1415,"There may be incest in big-time college football officiating. In the fourth quarter of the Oct. 29 football game between No. 3 Clemson and 12th-ranked Florida State, the Seminoles were thinking upset. FSU led 28-26 when star tailback Dalvin Cook ripped off a 50-yard run into Clemson territory. Then came a penalty flag for an illegal block, negating the play. FSU Coach Jimbo Fisher stormed the sideline, screaming at the officials, dropping an apparent F-bomb. Then came another flag, for unsportsmanlike conduct. FSU punted. Clemson escaped with a 37-34 win. Fisher resumed his tantrum at a postgame press conference, blasting the game’s officials as ""gutless"" and ""wrong."" Eyes bulging, Fisher said, ""You hold coaches accountable [and] players accountable—hold the damn officials accountable."" The Atlantic Coast Conference, which includes both FSU and Clemson, later fined Fisher $20,000. Blaming the zebras is hardly novel. But Fisher’s tirade revived a question that has taken on greater significance in the era of lucrative college football playoffs: Do officials paid by the top NCAA conferences slant their calls—even if only unconsciously—to help their employers’ top teams? New research suggests the answer is yes. Unlike in NCAA basketball, which draws referees from pools overseen by groups of conferences, most football referees are hired, trained, rewarded, and disciplined by individual conferences. That means officials are entrusted with making decisions that could hurt their employers—as with the call in the Clemson-FSU game. Clemson was the ACC team with the better shot at making the College Football Playoff and the financial bonanza it dangles. ""This is an incestuous situation,"" says Rhett Brymer, a business management professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He spent more than a year parsing almost 39,000 fouls called in games involving NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision teams in the 2012-2015 seasons. His research finds ""ample evidence of biases among conference officials,"" including ""conference officials showing partiality towards teams with the highest potential to generate revenue for their conference."" It’s potentially a big deal now that the playoff has become such a rich source of cash for the Power 5 conferences that supply the teams: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern Conference, and ACC. Those conferences split about $275 million in bowl-season television money, and get paid an additional $6 million for each of their teams that qualify for the four-team playoff, plus $2.16 million for expenses. That’s on top of money for game tickets and merchandise, as well as the recruiting bump that can help schools return to the playoff year after year (see Alabama). The Miami of Ohio research offers no evidence that specific officials intentionally skewed game outcomes. Nor does it assert that conferences would try to manipulate the part-time, independent contractors who officiate for $2,000 to $2,500 a game. Brymer’s data suggest something more insidious. Across the 3,000-odd regular-season and bowl games he studied, a bit less than half of the fouls called were what he terms ""discretionary""—holding, pass interference, unsportsmanlike conduct, and personal fouls like roughing the passer. Refs were on average 10 percent less likely to throw discretionary flags on teams that enjoy both strong playoff prospects and winning traditions. Brymer calls these teams ""protected flagships."" Protected flagships in the Big Ten did especially well with officials, the research shows. Ohio State, the conference’s most competitive flagship team in the years Brymer studied, was 14 percent less likely to be dinged for a discretionary foul than, say, Purdue, a non-flagship team with little chance of contending for a national title. The Buckeyes fared even better with refs in 2014, when it made the first-ever formal playoff and won the national championship on Jan. 12, 2015. Rogers Redding, national coordinator for NCAA football officiating, says referees are human but unfailingly scrupulous. ""I can unequivocally say that I have never seen any sign of bias on the part of officials at any level,"" says Redding, who officiated NCAA football for 18 years. While admitting ""my bias is to be defensive about this,"" Redding faults Brymer’s research for failing to account for whether the fouls analyzed were correctly called. ""Some teams are just better"" at avoiding penalties, he says. The study also doesn’t establish a baseline from which to judge variations in calls, Redding says. ""What’s the expectation of the number of fouls that would be called in the absence of bias? We don’t know.""  NCAA refs undergo training year-round, from spring practice scrimmages to fortnightly videos prepared by Redding. ""This is an avocation,"" he says, with refs dreaming of being selected to work a bowl game or, the pinnacle, a national championship. Botching penalty calls can cost refs those opportunities—and their jobs. Spokespeople for the Power 5 conferences either declined to comment or didn’t respond to interview requests. Barry Mano, founder and president of the 22,000-member National Association of Sports Officials, wishes Brymer had included fouls like offsides and such decisions as ball spots. ""Very few things in officiating aren’t discretionary,"" he says. However, Mano concedes that officials could be susceptible to unconscious pressures and thinks it reasonable to consider moving refs out from under conference control. ""The perception of our impartiality is important,"" he says. If one assumes zero bias on the part of on-field officials, Brymer says, his data should show greater consistency among calls. Instead, ""where officials from some conferences are systematically calling it one way, other conference officials call it another way. Individual people and crews will have their own idiosyncratic ways of calling games. But this is more than that."" The refs are subject to the scrutiny of large organizations, he says, ""which we in business all know is subject to money and power."" As an assistant professor at Miami of Ohio’s Farmer School of Business, Brymer, 43, usually writes about such esoterica as the use of human capital in corporations. He grew up in Florida, and became a Florida State fan when he lived on the same block as legendary Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden. Brymer was in the stands for the 2003 ""Swindle in the Swamp,"" when ACC refs were pilloried for questionable calls that helped his team beat archrival Florida. While earning his Ph.D. at Texas A&M, he came to sympathize with Aggie fans who believed that all close calls favored the University of Texas. ""I reached a breaking point,"" Brymer says. Weary of fans whining about refs without empirical evidence, he decided to see if he could find any. ""At least I’m bringing myself peace,"" he says. Earlier research he presented at an MIT sports analytics conference drew criticism from the NCAA’s Redding. In an e-mail exchange, Redding told Brymer the study oversimplified things by merely using total penalty yards to gauge bias, without accounting for the different types of fouls called or other factors. Seeking a more precise measuring stick, Brymer bought four years of data—38,871 penalties, including offsetting and declined calls—from SportSource Analytics, a firm that provides data to the committee that chooses the four playoff teams. Working with Miami business students Mickey Whitford and Michael Macey, he analyzed it against half a dozen variables, including home field, the Las Vegas betting line, and ""game outcome uncertainty,"" which discounts fouls called in blowouts while accounting for tight games in which refs might be reluctant to toss late flags. Brymer accounted for officiating crews from different conferences and distinguished games between conference foes from those between teams from different conferences. (The away team’s conference usually provides the on-field officials.) He defined flagship teams as those with an all-time winning percentage above 60 percent and protected teams as those ranked highly in Associated Press polls. The results show significant variations in penalty calls among conferences and seasons. Pac-12 officials showed the most erratic tendencies, swerving from favoring protected flagship teams in 2012-14 to punishing them in 2015. Playoff contenders lacking the flagship label—such as Wisconsin this year—often draw more subjective penalties than flagship teams, like Michigan, that also happen to generate healthy revenue. Some of the study’s conclusions defy more-cynical views. For instance, teams favored by Vegas tended to get significantly more discretionary calls against them than underdogs. Ref-baiters might be distressed to learn that the SEC—winners of eight of the last 10 national titles—appears to have the least biased officials. ACC refs actually worked against their top teams in 2012, with discretionary calls against them making up 56 percent of penalties, vs. 41 percent for less-competitive squads. The 56 percent dropped sharply over the next three years, during which two flagships—Clemson and Florida State—went undefeated through the ACC championship game. FSU won the national title after the 2013 regular season. With a per-game average of about 13 penalties, the alleged bias might apply to only one or two fouls. But a single call or no-call can be disastrous, as Michigan State fans can painfully attest. Last year, the Spartans lost to Nebraska on a controversial touchdown pass to a receiver who stepped out of bounds—illegally, to MSU partisans—before the catch. Brymer argues that the conferences should yield oversight of officials to an independent national body or regional pools, as with basketball. Redding says, ""That’s a reasonable question to ask"" but the conferences have worked hard to standardize officiating practices and ""are happy with what they’ve got."" Retired Big Ten ref and current ESPN analyst Bill LeMonnier says it wouldn’t hurt to assign more third-conference officiating crews—a Pac-12 group for Alabama vs. Penn State, for instance—especially in big games. ""If that eliminates the perception, it’s worth doing,"" LeMonnier says. Last Saturday’s Michigan-Ohio State classic underscored again the outsize role refs can play in big games. After Michigan’s 30-27 loss, Coach Jim Harbaugh said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" in officials, citing among other things a borderline pass interference call that extended a late Ohio State drive. Both teams came into the game as protected flagships, but Harbaugh might think the Buckeyes were a little more protected than the Wolverines.",New research suggests the answer is yes

1425,"Physicists working with a powerful observatory on Earth announced Thursday that they have finally detected ripples in space and time created by two colliding black holes, confirming a prediction made by Albert Einstein 100 years ago. These ripples in the fabric of space-time, called gravitational waves, were created by the merger of two massive black holes 1.3 billion years ago. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on Earth detected them on Sept. 14, 2015, and scientists evaluated their findings and put them through the peer review process before publicly disclosing the landmark discovery today. While this finding potentially opens a up a new way to learn more about how the universe works, there's one question in particular non-scientists seem to want answered: Can we finally travel through time now? Just imagine few years from now, hopefully time travel can be made possible. If only einstein was still alive. Rejoyce cosmos enthusiasts. — Mix (@lobotomixxs) February 11, 2016 @MattMichaelK Anything new found with space/time makes me think time travel is coming. Yes? — DJ Ol' Youngin (@EasterBunny_24) February 11, 2016 Time travel soon hopefully? https://t.co/BYSHL79hvT — Mike Masters (@recordmanmike) February 11, 2016 First of all, it's not a bad question. Think about space-time as a fabric that stretches through the universe and is affected by matter like stars, black holes, planets and other cosmic objects. Massive bodies warp space-time around them, creating what we feel as gravity on Earth. It would follow that learning more about it could lead to some kind of understanding of how to manipulate space-time to somehow travel through time. However, according to one well-known expert, this new gravitational wave discovery won't necessarily get us there. ""I don’t think it [the detection of gravitational waves] is going to bring us any closer to being able to do time travel. I wish it would,"" said LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne during a press conference announcing the discovery. Thorne should know, given that he was also an executive producer on the 2014 film Interstellar. Even though we probably won't be able to surf a gravitational wave into the future or the past, this finding still means a lot for physics. The merger of the two black holes ""created a violent storm in space-time,"" Thorne said, allowing scientists to see the disruption in space-time as it passed through Earth's part of space. By confirming that gravitational waves are produced by the extreme collisions of massive objects in the universe, it gives scientists a new way to explore space. Instead of just looking at the cosmos in infrared, optical and ultraviolet light, researchers can now use gravity as another way to investigate. But the book isn't necessarily closed on the time travel question. Some scientists haven't yet counted out the idea that this discovery could lead to something unexpected way down the line. ""The discovery will allow us to explore space and time in a spectacular new way,"" physicist Brian Greene told Mashable. ""Might that one day yield breakthroughs in space travel or perhaps even in time travel? Who knows. But deep understanding is the first step forward."" Have something to add to this story?

1443,"When I think of mega-successful childhood actors and celebrities, there's one thing I don't typically think of: college. And it isn't without lack of reason, either. When was the last time you were strolling through Georgetown and saw Miley Cyrus wearing a heavy bookbag and a pair of Norts? And could you imagine Zac Efron going to his professor's office hours at Northwestern? It seems like it's just not a typical thing. It seems like some childhood celebrities have enough money in their bank accounts to match Harvard's endowment. What good is a formal education going to do for them? There are many celebrities that are defying this principle, though. The Sprouse twins and Dakota Fanning are currently pursuing an education at New York University, and Miranda Cosgrove is doing the same at the University of Southern California; and Emma Watson is helping to blaze this trail. Most teenagers would gladly offer up the words ""stunning"" and ""flawless"" to describe Emma Watson. It seems as though a huge percentage of teenage girls would like to be Emma Watson, and an equally large portion of teenage boys would like to be with Emma Watson. (I may have proposed to Emma on Twitter before... several times... but I digress.) Now, this girl that we all idolize has something to add to her package: a degree in English literature from an incredibly prestigious university. Emma has become a beacon of light for so many teens in so many ways, but Emma's education is probably my favorite thing about her. It's likely that the shoes she wore to Brown's graduation were more expensive than Brown's tuition. No, Emma didn't need the education in the same terms that so many teenagers seek an education. She's definitely financially secure. She may not even do anything with her education -- in the same terms that you or I might think of doing something with an education -- but Emma wanted the education. She knew that it would make her a better version of herself. I am so glad to see each of these celebrity students in college. It's enormously inspiring to see a person earning an education not because they need it for financial security, but because they desire it. I'm thankful for Emma Watson, the Sprouse twins and all the other celebs pursuing an education. Through their leadership, I've realized something: when I fly back to Connecticut this fall to stay (shout-out to Wesleyan University '18!), I won't look to college for a money-making diploma. Like Emma, my ultimate goal will be to graduate from college as a better version of myself.",Emma has become a beacon of light for so many teens in so many ways

To combat her helpless feeling, the teacher asked if she could write a letter to the student at the hospital, and was told that she would love that.

1445,"© REUTERS Pope Francis leaves at the end of a meeting with youths at the Vatican May 28, 2016. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis says he has no intention of quitting the papacy -- a possibility opened up by his predecessor Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. The pope, responding to a question from a young person at a Vatican event, said on Sunday ""I never thought of quitting being pope, or of leaving because of the many responsibilities."" The pope has previously said he envisioned a short papacy before going on ""to the Father's house,"" but he has never specifically ruled out following in Benedict's footsteps. Benedict retired in 2013, the first pope to step down in 600 years. The pope spoke at a Vatican gathering for the Scholas Occurentes global educational initiative that he launched. George Clooney, accompanied by his wife Amal, and Richard Gere were honored for their contributions. The question of the number of popes who have retired is a bit of a trick question, in that the answer is based on a murky historical record. The short answer is, scholars are certain that at least four popes stepped down while still alive, but as many as eight may have. Benedict IX sold the papacy to his godfather and retired around 1044. Gregory VI, Benedict IX's godfather, was forced to resign around 1046 because he bought the papacy. Celestine V resigned in 1294 after being pope for only five months because he was a hermit by inclination who was ""unprepared and unfit"" for the role. Gregory XII retired in 1425 to end what was known as the ""Great Schism,"" a division over ideals within the Catholic Church that nearly brought the whole institution down. Other popes that may have retired include: Pontian (became pope in 230 and likely resigned in 235); Marcellinus (became pope in 296 and resigned or died around 304); Liberius (became pope in 352 and may have resigned around 366); John XVIII (became pope in 1003 and resigned or died around 1009.) Francis agreed to the proposal during a closed-door meeting with some 900 superiors of women's religious orders.Earlier this month, Pope Francis made headlines when he said he is willing to create a commission to study whether women can be deacons in the Catholic Church, signaling an openness to letting women serve in ordained ministry currently reserved to men. Deacons are ordained ministers but are not priests, though they can perform many of the same functions as priests: preside at weddings, baptisms and funerals, and preach. They cannot, however, celebrate Mass. Expanding opportunities for women in the Church has been debated for years. Currently, married men -- who are also mostly excluded from the Roman Catholic priesthood -- can serve as deacons. Women cannot, however, though historians say women served as deacons in the early Church.",no intention of quitting the papacy
1447,"Darron Collins, president of the private College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, advises families on the best way to decide on a college. — Danielle Douglas-Gabriel By Darron Collins The beauty of our higher education system is its diversity. Our more than 4,000 colleges and universities offer an often bewildering choice of courses, formats and cultures. In these coming weeks, college-bound high school seniors and their parents will try to balance the merits of such issues as big versus small, rural versus urban, research-focused versus teaching-focused, higher cost versus lower cost, prestigious versus less well-known and public versus private. Here’s an especially important factor they may want to add to the mix: how much ""experiential learning"" truly takes place in class and on campus. When I was making the college decision 30 years ago, I thought that size was my most important criterion. I didn’t want to ""be just a number,"" which I thought I would be at a big school. But I realize now that the issue wasn’t only about numbers — I wanted close and frequent access to the faculty, and to work with them to learn. I didn’t want to be lectured at; I wanted to have conversations and collaborate with my professors and peers — to learn by doing, not just by listening. It seems to me that many students today, perhaps more than ever, crave connection with the core of the university. They’re not focused on Greek life, plush dorms, climbing walls or lazy rivers. The core to them means the faculty and whether they will be able to work with the faculty and their classmates to make discoveries, to engage in exploring new ideas and old, and to truly experience the learning process. Admissions departments understand this desire for exposure to the core. ""You’re not a number here"" is a phrase you’ll find sprinkled generously in college admissions materials. The question is, what does being more than a number really look like? Student population may seem like a good starting point. But instructors at some schools in the 2,000- to 5,000-student range may have little interest in working closely with undergraduates. At the same time, some enormous schools have cultivated excellent teachers who stress the importance of dialogue with students. Student–faculty ratio is a metric often used as a proxy for this direct exposure to the faculty. For example, anything under 12:1 might be considered tight-knit. But any college database will list hundreds of colleges and universities with student to faculty ratios in that range. A low student-to-faculty ratio simply doesn’t guarantee that faculty are interested in undergraduate teaching and in engaging actively with students. In fact, there is no precise metric. That being said, there are some things students seeking a tight-knit college experience might consider on that upcoming admitted-student visit. Here are five: Not everyone can make visits in person, but you can ask questions and seek information via email and telephone. College is an important choice — students and parents need to be proactive during this process in order to reach the best decision. Thirty years ago, I found the close experience I sought at College of the Atlantic, in Bar Harbor, Maine. COA puts faculty–student dialogue at the core of the institution. The college is strategically small, with a student population capped at 350 and a student-faculty ratio of 10:1. Today, as COA’s president, I work with our students, faculty, and alumni to continue to build an environment where student-faculty collaboration is the cornerstone of who we are. In today’s political climate, it’s especially important for students to gain the skills that come from engaging in conversation and dialogue with faculty and peers, in asking and responding to complex, nuanced questions, and in respectfully but appropriately challenging authority. Colleges and universities that enable this to happen are challenging, exciting, formative places, and are helping us shape the kind of critical thinkers we’ll need in the years ahead.","how much ""experiential learning"" truly takes place in class and on campus."

1454,"Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York. Photo via Wikimedia Commons Now that the nightmare search for escaped murderers Richard Matt and David Sweat has come to an end, New York's inspector general, state police, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are all looking closely at the prison they busted out of. On Tuesday, state officials announced that nine security officers and three members of Clinton Correctional Facility's executive team—including Prison Superintendent Steven Racette—have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to the Albany Times Union. That's not exactly a stunner given the sexually charged cooperation the escapees allegedly received from staff. But federal law enforcement sources told CNN Monday that the FBI is looking into the possibility that some kind of drug-trafficking ring was operating at the terrifying facility in Dannemora, New York. If any of the probes produce evidence of large-scale corruption at the prison, it would go a long way toward explaining just how Matt and Sweat made their daring escape on June 6. We already know that Joyce Mitchell, a 51-year-old civilian tailor at the prison, has been charged with putting tools into hamburger meat and smuggling them into the prison. Along the way, she seems to have involved a possibly unwitting corrections officer named Gene Palmer, who's charged with sneaking the meat around a metal detector in return for paintings by Matt, who was a talented portraitisted before he was killed in a shoot-out on Friday. Both Mitchell and Palmer have pleaded not guilty, and Sweat has reportedly told investigators the latter was not in on the plot. But Sweat and Matt were were part of the prison's so-called honor block, which afforded them greater freedoms than most. They were allowed to wear regular clothes and keep conveniences like refrigerators and hotplates, for instance, and a former maintenance supervisor at the prison told CNN that some prisoners have historically been allowed to perform electrical and plumbing work in the catwalk area that later served as part of Sweat and Matt's escape route. If the escapees were colluding with prison employees in some kind of drug-trafficking ring, they would likely have enjoyed still more freedom. Workers at Clinton have already admitted to knowing some prisoners were using heroin and have suggested employees were involved, CNN reported. Adding to the intrigue is that since David Sweat was captured alive on Sunday, he reportedly told investigators that he and Matt conducted a dry run of their escape the night before they pulled it off. Of course, once the two got out of jail, the police had their share of fuck-ups. Although Governor Andrew Cuomo has said state police ""did a better job than they've ever done,"" investigators initially weren't even sure Sweat and Matt had made it out of the prison, believing they might be holed up in its tunnels. State law enforcement also reportedly kept local police in the dark, and despite some 1,300 personnel, it took well over three weeks for New York's Finest to track the fugitives down. No one was killed by the dangerous murderers as the state police got their shit together, so this wasn't a total disaster. But the prolonged search must have cost taxpayers a pretty penny, and putting 12 prison workers on administrative leave until the corruption investigation gets sorted out will likely only add to that tab.","But federal law enforcement sources told CNN Monday that the FBI is looking into the possibility that some kind of drug-trafficking ring was operating at the terrifying facility in Dannemora, New York."

1461,"Hong Kong chooses its next leader on Sunday in a vote overshadowed by fierce divisions over stalled political reform in the city. It is the first chief executive election since Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by mass pro-democracy rallies in 2014. Protesters wanted fully democratic elections for their leader - but Beijing refused. Pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong has called the current electoral process ""a selection rather than an election"". In a nutshell: What is happening? A small group of mainly pro-Beijing electors will choose from three candidates to succeed outgoing leader CY Leung. His deputy, Carrie Lam, is Beijing's choice for the top job. But her main rival, former finance chief John Tsang, is the public's favourite, according to opinion polls. The pro-democracy camp are backing Mr Tsang in a likely unsuccessful bid to keep Ms Lam out. The third candidate is retired judge Woo Kwok-hing. So who does get to vote? Ordinary Hong Kong people have no say. Instead, Hong Kong's 1,200-seat Election Committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body, will decide on the next leader. The Legislative Council's 70 members - half of whom are directly elected - form part of this committee. But most of the members are elected by business, professional or special interest groups. Critics say entities that lean towards Beijing are given disproportionately large representation. In the most recent selection for the Election Committee, pro-democracy activists secured 325 seats on the committee - the highest number ever. However, this does not give them enough seats to control who becomes the next chief executive. How does it work? Candidates need 601 votes to win. If no candidate reaches this total, the top two candidates go to a second round. Incumbent CY Leung limped over the line with 689 votes in 2012 - despite having Beijing's backing. ""689"" then became a pejorative nickname for the unpopular leader - and Beijing will want its choice, Ms Lam, to do much better. Who's in the lead? In the nominating round, Carrie Lam secured 580 votes, just shy of the winning mark. Woo Kwok-hing got 180 votes and John Tsang secured 165, just over the qualifying threshold of 150. Beijing has made it clear that it backs Ms Lam and there are multiple reports of lobbying behind the scenes on her behalf. John Tsang is seen as the main threat, given the high levels of public support for him. Though pro-establishment, he is seen as the more moderate choice, and more than 300 pro-democracy committee members say they will vote for him. It's the first time the pan-democrat camp has backed an establishment candidate. Mr Tsang also has support from some pro-establishment voters, but this is unlikely to be enough to defeat Ms Lam. So what are the candidates like? Carrie Lam has served as Hong Kong's chief secretary - the number two position - for five years and has almost four decades of public service behind her. She has been praised as a strong administrator but is despised by the pro-democracy camp for backing a mainland ruling saying that while residents could vote for their leader in 2017, they could only choose from a list of pre-approved candidates. She's been nicknamed CY2.0 - another version of the outgoing Mr Leung. She's also been accused of being out of touch with voters after gaffes including a bizarre search for toilet paper and a failure to use a transport swipe card. John Tsang is also a career civil servant and Hong Kong's longest-serving financial secretary. Praised for having a common touch - he's got almost 270,000 Facebook followers - he's called on Hong Kong's divided residents to come together. But he's been criticised as financial secretary in the past for under spending on social welfare to preserve budget surpluses. His nickname is ""Pringles"", or ""Uncle Chips"", for his resemblance to a snack mascot. Mr Woo served as a High Court judge for many years. He is seen as moderate and pro-establishment, and is popular with some activists and young people who feel he is not ""tainted"" by politics. But analysts say Ms Lam and Mr Tsang as seen as the two contenders with a chance of winning. Would either bring Hong Kong closer to the vote? It seems very unlikely. In 2015 pro-democracy lawmakers rejected Beijing's offer of universal suffrage for the chief executive election if the candidates were pre-approved by the Chinese government, and the proposal was voted down. As a result, this election is being conducted under the existing process. Carrie Lam advocated on behalf of Beijing's position and has expressed reservations about restarting the political reform process, saying ""We need to ask ourselves very seriously whether we have any prospect of achieving a consensus before we trigger another intense debate in society"". John Tsang initially expressed similar sentiments but then promised to relaunch the process ""with the greatest determination and courage"". But he says Beijing's framework must be the starting point for any movement. Regardless of either stance, there has been no sign Beijing is willing to compromise on this. There are also signs it is getting bolder about interventions in Hong Kong, including its lobbying for Ms Lam, its role in blocking two pro-independence lawmakers from the legislature and the recent abduction of a billionaire from a hotel in Hong Kong. So what's the mood? The mass pro-democracy rallies may have ended but many young people remain unhappy. Joshua Wong, who led the 2014 protests, has refused to back any candidate and will be protesting outside the election venue. ""No one will deny that Carrie Lam is the worst one and a nightmare for us - but it doesn't mean we can put aside our principles and endorse any pro-China candidate,"" he told AFP news agency. A human rights group is organising a march as the polls take place and Hong Kong police say 1,800 officers will be deployed - more than the total number of electors. But it is also true to say that during the political ructions of the last three years - from Occupy protests to the politicised ""fishball"" clashes - there have been Hong Kongers who expressed support for the status quo.",Hong Kong chooses its next leader on Sunday in a vote overshadowed by fierce divisions over stalled political reform in the city.

While air travel is considered the safest mode of transportation, where you sit can make a difference. A recent TIME study may have put to rest whether the aisle or window seat is better. It turns out the answer is neither of them; middle seats in the rear of the aircraft are the safest place to sit. Most Popular The center seats farther up in the aircraft are a different story, though. ""The middle of the cabin, historically, has the highest overall fatality rates–more specifically the middle aisle seats....The fatality rate [in middle seats near the back of the plane] is 28%, compared to 44% [in the aisle seats in the middle of the plane],"" says the publication. Other safe spots are the two rows closest to the emergency exit. Why? The study's hunch is that those seated there could exit the plane more quickly if they had to. Still, the publication notes that these findings aren't the be-all and end-all. First, the data merely found a link between those locations on the plane and death rates; it doesn't mean that those seats caused or prevented death.

1479,"According to the CDC, 17 percent of all children and adolescents are classified as obese in the U.S. This number has continued to rise in the past 30 years. Now, at least 19 states have begun to send home ""fat letters' or BMI reports for students from elementary to high school in hopes of eliminating the childhood obesity epidemic. While these reports may be a step closer to helping obese children, some fear that letters could trigger unhealthy eating habits or low self esteem. Instead of the general teachings of health and nutrition or physical education, the BMI reports are much more individually specific. In the clip above, Josh Brooks, blogger at OpReclaim.com, tells HuffPost Live how the BMI report could have been the wake up call he needed.

1483,"PRIESTESSES With the creation of a commission to study the possibility of ordaining women as deacons, Pope Francis may have just changed everything. ROME — At what was meant to be a love fest for 900 nuns at a meeting of the International Union of Superiors General at the Vatican on Thursday, Pope Francis didn’t just rock the boat; he may have created a tidal wave. During the question and answer session of the meeting, one of the sisters at the conference brought up the fact that women had served as deacons in the early church. Then, according to the National Catholic Reporter, she asked the pope, ""Why not construct an official commission that might study the question?"" Francis then said that he had discussed the matter of those early deaconesses with a professor several years earlier, but that he remained unclear about what role they actually served. ""What were these female deacons?"" Francis said he asked the professor, according to the National Catholic Reporter. ""Did they have ordination or no? It was a bit obscure. What was the role of the deaconess in that time?"" Then, apparently thinking out loud, he endorsed the idea. ""Constituting an official commission that might study the question?"" Francis asked. ""I believe yes. It would do good for the church to clarify this point. I am in agreement. I will speak to do something like this."" The pope went on to address other concerns from the group of sisters, and dole out advice like ""take a deep breath"" and ""get more sleep"" and then revisited the topic. ""I accept,"" the pope said. ""It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well."" Deacons in the Catholic context act as a sort of priest-lite: they cannot perform the sacrament of the Eucharist (give holy communion) and they don’t have to take the vow of celibacy; in fact many are married. But they can perform any number of ministerial roles, from baptisms to funerals, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops website, which is something many of the world’s Catholics just might appreciate. Quoting canon 1024 of the Code of Canon Law, Catholic website Crux points out that at the moment, ""only a baptized male can receive the sacrament of ordination, so the law does not presently permit female deacons."" Crux editors then question whether Francis will change the law, which is within his powers as pope. As exciting as this is for roughly one half of the world’s Catholic population (the female half), surely not everyone will be pleased at the idea of women nudging one step closer to the all-male clergy club that rules the Catholic Church. Almost immediately, liberal priests tweeted their praise. Father James Martin, a prolific author priest from New York, tweeted that the news filled him with ""immense joy"" and that, ""Women deacons would be able to baptize, preside at marriages and funerals, and preach at Mass. It would be an immense gift to the church."" A more conservative priest tweeted, ""Has @Pontifex forgotten about this 2002 study about diaconate where issue of women deacons was examined?"" referring to a Vatican study that all but nixed the idea.","With the creation of a commission to study the possibility of ordaining women as deacons, Pope Francis may have just changed everything."

As buyers clamored for homes, prices surged. But then the economy slowed and the bottom fell out of the housing market. Homeowners were unable to make payments, and sagging values made refinancing or selling impossible. The market crashed in what is widely considered one of the worst recessions to hit the country.

1497,"The nation's uninsured rate has fallen to a historic low under Obamacare, but you'd never know that listening to Republican leaders speak. Bracing for a harsh assessment of their Obamacare repeal bill, House GOP leadership and the Trump administration are attacking the accuracy of the congressional agency tasked with reviewing it. Now, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to report, as soon as Monday, that millions of Americans could lose coverage under the Republican bill. And the GOP is likely to continue pushing back against the CBO. Here's the thing: Republicans are right that the CBO misjudged how many people would be insured through the Obamacare exchanges. But the agency was much closer to the mark on Obamacare's overall impact on coverage. This is backed up by reports from several agencies and organizations that have looked at what actually did happen after the sweeping health reform law was enacted in 2010. They all found unprecedented drops in the uninsured rate among non-elderly Americans. (Nearly all senior citizens are covered through Medicare.) The uninsured rate for those under age 65 plummeted to 10.3% in the first nine months of 2016, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's the lowest share since the agency began tracking 45 years ago. In 2010, the rate hit an all-time high of 18.2% before drifting down to 16.6% in 2013, the year before the exchanges and Medicaid expansion went into effect. CBO projected that about 8% to 10% of non-elderly Americans would be uninsured in its early reports. Only 28 million people were uninsured last year, compared to just over 48 million in 2010. ""There has never been a decline this large and over such a short period of time,"" said Rachel Garfield, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. Some of the drop is due to the improving economy, leading more people to secure jobs that provided health benefits. But most of it can be traced to millions gaining coverage thanks to Obamacare, she said. Before the Affordable Care Act, most of the uninsured were low-income and either couldn't afford coverage or didn't have access to it. The health reform law provided generous subsidies for these folks to buy policies on the individual exchanges or enabled them to sign up for Medicaid in the 31 states that agreed to expand. Also, it allowed many young adults to stay on their parents' plans until age 26. Other surveys back up the CDC data, which is considered the gold standard. The most recent Census Bureau data shows that the uninsured rate for all Americans fell to 9.1% in 2015, down from 13.3% in 2013. And the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index found that only 10.9% of American adults were uninsured in the final quarter of last year, compared to a high of 18% in the third quarter of 2013. The results are based on interview with more than 40,000 people. Allowing kids to remain on their parents' plans and expanding Medicaid both had noticeable impacts on the uninsured rate, said Dan Witters, the index's research director. The GOP bill would keep the first provision, but it would end enhanced federal support for Medicaid starting in 2020 and would curtail federal funding for the entire program. Also, it would replace Obamacare subsidies, which are based on income and cost of coverage, with refundable tax credits based mainly on age. These changes would likely render coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans, experts say.",The nation's uninsured rate has fallen to a historic low under Obamacare
1501,"Rates of marijuana use among Colorado's teenagers are essentially unchanged in the years since the state's voters legalized marijuana in 2012, new survey data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment shows. In 2015, 21 percent of Colorado youths had used marijuana in the past 30 days. That rate is slightly lower than the national average and down slightly from the 25 percent who used marijuana in 2009, before legalization. The survey was based on a random sample of 17,000 middle and high school students in Colorado. ""The survey shows marijuana use has not increased since legalization, with four of five high school students continuing to say they don’t use marijuana, even occasionally,"" the Colorado health department said in a news release. The numbers out of Colorado are being closely monitored by policymakers and advocates on both sides of the marijuana legalization divide. Researchers generally agree that marijuana use during adolescence should be strongly discouraged — younger users are more likely to become dependent on the drug, and teens who use marijuana heavily are at higher risk of a number of mental and physical health problems later in life. Opponents have often claimed that marijuana legalization would lead to more kids smoking pot, with all the negative health consequences that would entail. But the scant data available until now hasn't borne this out. Voters in Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia voted to legalize marijuana in the 2014 midterm elections. They joined Colorado and Washington, which did so in 2012. So could other states follow suit in 2016? The Washington Post's Niraj Chokshi breaks down the possibilities. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) National surveys have shown that teen marijuana use rates are falling across the country. But there haven't been many numbers available specifically for states such as Colorado and Washington where it is legal. Federal data released late last year showed that teen use rates in Colorado and Washington were essentially flat, but they covered only 2014, the first year commercial marijuana was available in those states. The latest data from Colorado includes 2015, reflecting two full years of the legal marijuana market's effect. These numbers give the strongest indication yet that fears of skyrocketing adolescent use have not materialized. ""These statistics clearly debunk the theory that making marijuana legal for adults will result in more teen use,"" Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. ""Levels of teen use in Colorado have not increased since it ended marijuana prohibition, and they are lower than the national average. Elected officials and voters in states that are considering similar proposals should be wary of claims that it will hurt teens."" Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group opposing legalization, has pointed out that the most recent federal surveys show that teen marijuana use rates in Colorado are among the highest in the country. But this latest survey, conducted by the state of Colorado, shows that teen use rates in that state are about average.

For starters, this latest survey polled a much larger sample of Colorado students, 17,000, than the federal survey, which polls fewer than 400 Colorado teenagers in a given year. That much larger sample could produce a more accurate estimate than the smaller numbers in the federal drug survey. There's a simple reason why legalization may not be having much of an effect on teen marijuana use — adolescents already report that marijuana is widely available. Nationally, roughly 80 percent of 12th-graders say that pot is easy to get. The kids who want to smoke weed are probably already doing so — and legalization would do little to change that.","""The survey shows marijuana use has not increased since legalization, with four of five high school students continuing to say they don’t use marijuana, even occasionally,"""

1508,"There might be good news for the reformed thumb-suckers and nail-biters out there: Children with those habits show fewer allergies later in life. All the nasty junk you orally introduced to your body when you sucked your thumb may have actually acclimated your immune system to handle microbial organisms. That exposure reduced your risk of developing allergies later in life, according to the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Study, a New Zealand-based study that followed the lives of 1,037 subjects, born in 1972 and 1973, into adulthood. When the subjects were 13 years old, the researchers found that children who either bit their nails or sucked their thumbs had a 38% rate of atopic sensitization, or reaction to an allergen via a skin-prick test, compared to the 49% rate of sensitization in children who did neither. When the subjects were tested again at age 32, the reactions were the same. The study even showed that children who sucked their thumbs and bit their fingernails had a 31% lower risk of adult allergies, compared to the 38% of children who did one or the other, according to the study's lead author Bob Hancox from the University of Otago. The results don't indicate an allergy cure-all. The study didn't find any associations between thumb-sucking and reducing asthma or hayfever, and the researchers don't even suggest parents encourage their children to pick up the habits for their health since they can't tell if there's a real health benefit. But if sucking your thumb actually makes your body better at resisting allergies in the future, the decades-long study suggests legitimacy for an age-old hardy adage: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger — or at least makes you sneeze less. However, if you read this and thought, ""Maybe picking my nose was actually good for me,"" sorry: Rooting around in your nostrils hasn't gotten any less dangerous.",31% lower risk of adult allergies

1513,"There probably is life on Mars and it may well be as we know it. Scientists believe there is bacteria clinging onto existence far beneath the frozen deserts of the Red Planet. And it is likely to be similar to the simple microbes that exist in the deep ice-bound lakes of Antarctica. Scientists say Mars and the Earth ‘almost certainly’ seeded each other with life billions of years ago when both planets were battered with huge asteroid strikes - sending fragments of them both into space. Biologists think discovering the life on Mars could show us how life first began to stir on our own world. Alfred McEwen, professor of planetary geology at the University of Arizona, said: ""The billion-year-old record of life on Earth is largely lost, but on Mars it is still preserved. ""There is probably a connection between life on Mars and life on Earth. ""So the search for ancient life on Mars may really be the search for the origin of life on Earth."" Professor McEwan is the principal investigator on Nasa’s HiRISE telescope which is orbiting Mars and producing detailed images of the surface. NASA has already identified underground water ‘wicking’ to the surface of the planet and samples collected by the Mars rovers have detected complex organic compounds. Professor McEwen told a conference in Tenerife attended by Professor Stephen Hawking and other Nobel laureates that life probably still survives in pockets below the surface where it would be warmer and they were sheltered from cosmic radiation. ""At the depth of a few kilometres it’s warm enough to keep H2O in a liquid state. There probably is life on Mars and it may well be as we know it. ""So if there was ever life on Mars in the past, it probably survives to the present day in these underground pockets. ""Mars is not very far away; Martian rocks from impacts can easily reach Earth; probably Earth rocks also reached Mars from impacts in the past. ""Life began on this planet about four billion years ago when there were lots of big-impact events, microorganisms could survive a trip between Earth and Mars.

1516,"This article originally appeared on VICE UK Near the beginning of new film The Childhood of a Leader, a young boy is learning to speak French. At the end of the exercise, his teacher, a prim but gentle Stacy Martin, tells him how well he is doing, and the boy, with eyes as hard as diamonds, purposefully places his hand on her breast. ""My mother lets me do it all the time,"" he tells her. We're in Versailles, France, in the aftermath of the First World War. The boy's American father, we learn, is helping negotiate the peace terms with Germany. His mother, in public, is distant and cold, leaving her son to the passing whims of nurses, maids, and tutors. You end up watching a similar creepy-child trope as was shown in We Need To Talk About Kevin, The Omen, and The Bad Seed. This kid isn't just a troublemaker, yearning for attention and engagement from his distant parents. We're watching something else—the early years of someone capable of living without a conscience, and who may well, we're led to believe, become a notorious figure in European history. But, watching films like this where kids are cast as mini-villains, what actually makes children evil? Can you go back to someone's childhood and predict a dickhead demagogue on the way? ""If you look at the childhoods of Franco, Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini, one very obvious thing they all had in common was very complex relationships with their fathers,"" says history professor Antonio Cazorla-Sanchez, also author of Franco: The Biography of a Myth , on the former Spanish dictator. ""Each of their fathers were frequently absent, and then, when present, were drunk and violent and threatening. That meant each child developed very close and emotionally intense relationships with their mothers. They went through their life resenting their fathers, while they always saw their mothers as a sanctuary of emotional refuge. But how might that work? ""It's easy to image the conversation. After a violent outbreak from their father, a mother vesting her hopes in the child could fuel a sense of that the child will be different. A belief in themselves as somehow greater than their environment."" There's an element of that idea reflected in Wilhelm Reich's The Mass Psychology of Fascism . It's a book published in 1933—the year Hitler took control of Germany—that served as an inspiration for this film, which was written and directed by Brady Corbet (best known for his role in Michael Haneke's 2007 Funny Gamesremake). In chapter five, Reich wrote that the family is ""the first cell"" of a fascist society, its ""first central reactionary germ cell, the most important place of reproduction of the reactionary and conservative individual."" He went on: ""Being itself caused by the authoritarian system, the family becomes the most important institution for its conservation."" ""There was a widespread idea at the time that the only way to be a parent was to be an authoritarian,"" Corbet says, speaking to me over the phone. ""Children were spoken to and not heard. I wanted to ask whether that might have been a contributing factor to the rise of some of the most notorious figures in history."" Jean-Paul Sartre also looms large in the film—The Childhood of a Leader takes its title from a 1939 Sartre short story, a portrait of a young boy who endures a very Freudian form of therapy before embracing the ideology of fascism. So, theories seem to point towards either a stifling authoritarianism setting children up for a fascist sensibility, or an exceptionalism borne from being molly-coddled. But not everyone who was a bit of a nightmare as a child grows up into an awful adult. And you start to walk into dangerous territory when you try to link distress in childhood with sadism later in life. Spend time with any normal child, from any stable, warm upbringing, and the chances are they're not always going to be good company. They're going to lose their temper, fail to control their impulses, maybe express their latent sexuality in strange and unruly ways. ""Many people of the time grew up with very cold relationships with their parents. That was the status quo, because we're talking about a very repressed period of history,"" Corbet says. ""But, of course, the years between the first and second world wars were defined by famine, poverty and death. They were the dark ages. What made these people different?"" The early twentieth century might have been Corbet's idea of the dark ages, but it was also an era that gave rise to figures who felt the need to remodel the world in their own image. People who felt compelled to not be a product of their environment, but to make their environment a product of them—whatever the cost, and however much death and destruction it might cause. I put that idea, of nature and nurture both playing a role, to Dr. Christopher Clark, a consultant forensic psychiatrist and executive director at Rampton high security hospital in Nottinghamshire. Clark's responsibilities at Rampton have included deciding whether ""Soham murderer"" Ian Huntley was fit to stand trial for killing two children in a small Cambridgeshire village in 2002. ""When you look around secure institutions like Rampton, you will find that many, and probably most, of the people in them have had traumatic upbringings,"" Clark says. ""They've often been the subject of neglect and abuse themselves. So there's a clear association between criminality and violence and fractured relationships—particularly with parents. ""But we're talking, of course, of people who were ambitious and are skilled enough to negotiate something like the Russian Revolution, or become totally revered by the populous, as Hitler was,"" Clark says. ""You can't do that without being highly capable at getting people onside, and getting people to listen to you. ""These are people who have managed to somehow use whatever happened in their background, whilst developing very unusual skill sets. They're rarefied examples."" But Clark is keen to press home a similar point. Institutions like Rampton make it easy for us to analyse people with violently criminal pasts; to link what they've done with what's happened to them. But what about all the people who went through traumatic childhoods, and didn't become dictators or criminals? ""In actual fact, a lot of people who go on to be very successful, and who we would regard as being forces of good, have also had unhappy and fractured childhoods,"" Clark says.

1517,"The romantic woo: the flowers, the dinner, the compliments. Maybe you hold the door open. Maybe you have perfected some Casanova moves in the boudoir that makes your lover swoon. But if you really want to leave a lasting impression, the most important thing may be what you do immediately after sex. We’re not saying you’re the kind of cad who loves and runs. You just might have been better trained in foreplay than the after play. And science is telling us the denouement and subsequent cool-down matter. 15 minutes of post-coitus cuddling boosts relationship satisfaction. That’s according to a pair of studies in the Archives of Sexual Behavior journal. Academics from two universities near Toronto queried more than 450 adults about their post-love-making actions and general relationship happiness. They found that the ""duration of post sex affection was associated with higher sexual satisfaction and, in turn, higher relationship satisfaction — suggest that ""the period after sex is a critical time for promoting satisfaction in intimate bonds."" Not all couples view cuddling equally — stereotypes say women want it, and men don’t. But stereotypes are meant to be broken. And sometime it’s the men who want the snuggles. Whatever your inclination, the truth seems to be that taking a few extra minutes to bask in each other’s glow will do wonders for your relationship. This worked over the course of three months of lovemaking — no word on if it matters after years of marriage, but at least, it still matters after the first blush. So if nothing else, she’ll be more likely to think fondly of your romantic time together if you take some time afterward for a little more togetherness. And she’s sure to make the rest of us say, ""I’ll have what she’s having.""",15 minutes of post-coitus cuddling boosts relationship satisfaction.
1518,"Most of us know that we need to be more physically active. Only 20% of American adults get the recommend amount of physical activity—150 minutes of the moderately intense aerobic kind—each week. But simply moving more isn't enough, according to a new report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine . The benefits of exercise can be blunted if you also spend most of the rest of your day sitting. Dr. David Alter, a heart expert from the University of Toronto and senior scientist at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and his colleagues found that sitting too much—even among people who exercise regularly—led to higher rates of hospitalization, heart disease and cancer, as well as early death. The researchers looked at 47 studies that asked people how much time they spent sitting and exercising, as well as rates of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and death from any cause. The more hours people in the studies spent sedentary—like watching TV or reclining on a couch—the higher their risk of all of these negative outcomes. Heavy sitters showed a 90% higher risk of developing diabetes than those who sat less, an 18% higher chance of dying of heart disease or cancer, and 24% greater odds of dying from any cause. These rates were the average among people who both exercised regularly and those who did not. ""What struck me, and I was quite surprised by this, was that the deleterious effects of sitting time were almost uniform across the board of total mortality, heart disease mortality, the occurrence of heart disease, the occurrence of cancer and the mortality from cancer,"" says Alter. ""When we see a consistent effect, that reaffirms that something real is going on."" What’s happening, he suspects, is that the metabolic effects of sitting are overwhelming any benefits that exercise might have. Even if people exercise regularly for half an hour or an hour a day, how they spend the remainder of that day is also important to their health. Alter says that the unhealthy effects of sitting are somewhat reduced among those who are physically active—by about 15%—but they aren’t completely erased. ""You can make a little bit of headway on the bad effects of sedentary time by at least doing some exercise,"" he says. ""But you can’t completely nullify it."" The only way to do that is to sit less, and not just exercise more. For so long, the public health message has been to move more and squeeze in as much active time as possible into the day. That message is still important, he says, but it needs to change as new research on the dangers of sitting starts to emerge. ""It’s time to modify the public health message,"" he says. ""We still need more research, but there is a signal there that it’s time to do that. We need two different strategies—one that targets exercise for 30 minutes to 60 minutes a day, and the other is to reduce sedentary behavior."" For his patients, Alter starts by helping them realize how much of their day they spend in a chair. There’s no prescription for sitting, and no research yet to support the optimal levels for avoiding cancer or heart disease or early death. But studies have shown that standing burns twice as many calories per hour, about 140, as sitting. And burning extra calories is a good way to maintain a healthy weight, one of the key factors in preventing heart disease and some cancers. ""Little things add up to a lot,"" says Alter, who says he checks emails while on a elliptical. He also recommends standing up or moving around for several minutes every half hour when you’re at your desk, and aiming to sit two to three hours less in a 12 hour day. If you can’t give up your favorite TV shows, he adds, stand during the commercials.",spend most of the rest of your day sitting
1521,"Apparently, there's a rumor circulating that The Pirate Bay might shut down soon. Various news sites have been speculating about the demise of the popular torrent site and what may happen next... Could Donald Trump be the one to pull the trigger? No, Trump personally can’t and won’t shut down The Pirate Bay. Period. Excuse me for the clickbait title and the strange intro, but since it’s the topic of this opinion piece, I thought it was warranted. Here’s what’s going on. The torrent community is in turmoil after the shutdowns of KAT and Torrentz. We’ve written about this extensively, but there’s a rather frustrating side-effect that we haven’t discussed so far. For some reason there’s a slew of news sites, prominently featured in search engines and on social media, that keep spreading fear and panic about a looming Pirate Bay shutdown. These publications take every piece of file-sharing related news, often sourced from TorrentFreak, and rewrite it in a way that suggests the world’s number one torrent site may disappear, or is already gone. Here are just a few headlines I’ve seen over the past few days. Click on the links at your own risk.

List Of Top Torrent Sites Inside (link) The Pirate Bay (TPB), KickassTorrents, Torrentz Shut Down: US Library of Congress As Next Alternative? (link) These reports have absolutely nothing to do with an apparent Pirate Bay shutdown of course. The last one, for example, bizarrely connects concerns the RIAA has about access to digital works at the Library of Congress, to the potential demise of TPB, which is pure nonsense. Pirate Bay Declared Dead Many other articles follow the same format, writing nonsensical trash such as the following: ""Other torrent sites such as TorrentFreak is not happy with the growing population of The Pirate Bay but they do appreciate the role that TPB is playing in the world of torrent sites."" The quote above comes from The Parent Herald, which also suggests that copyright trolls plan to fine The Pirate Bay. Clearly, they have not read the TorrentFreak article on the topic, which they’re quoting, or they simply don’t understand it. Might Shut Down Soon? So why are these ""news"" sites reporting this type of doom and gloom? The short answer is ad views. The clickbait articles are shared on social media, appear in Google news and in search results. The latter can bring in thousands of views. If people Google for ""The Pirate Bay,"" these headlines are featured as ""news"" and beg to be clicked on, generating revenue for the sites in question. For the very same reason you’ll see numerous articles about KAT and Torrentz alternatives. Click, Click, Click Why are we complaining about this? Well, these news reports are picked up by other sites and shared among thousands of people. At TorrentFreak we do our best to report news as accurately as possible, and these clickbait articles go directly against this, often using our name. We have addressed the clickbait issue in the past but in recent months it has gotten much worse. While there are many different sites guilty of this practice, we recently stumbled upon a ring of related publications that all belong to the same company. They carry names such as Parent Herald, iSports Times., University Herald, Mobile&Apps , Game&Guide and share a similar layout and design. The owner in question, according to the copyright statement, is the New York based company IQ Adnet, which is... surprise surprise, an ad network that specializes in premium digital and native advertising. That explains everything. There’s not much we can do about this, unfortunately, besides telling people what’s really going on and venting our frustration every now and then. In the meantime, we’ll be waiting for these sites to pick up the Trump angle, which shouldn’t take long. Update: It only took a few hours... Update: Apologies. Mobile&Apps was inaccurately linked to IQ Adnet. We confused it with Game&Guide which is not corrected above. For the record. At TorrentFreak we don’t use pay per view ads, partly to get rid of the pageview obsession. This means that the clickbait title we used for this article doesn’t bring in any extra money.","No, Trump personally can’t and won’t shut down The Pirate Bay. Period."
1522,"Blood has many roles in the metaphorical life of the human body. It’s the organ of kinship (""blood ties""), the seat of emotion (""blood lust"") and a vehicle for identity (""travel is in his blood""). But might it also be a window on the body’s fate? Many scientists are trying to answer that question as a practical matter, not a metaphor. They are scouring the blood for biomarkers — easily measured substances that illuminate what’s going on in hard-to-reach places. Biomarkers aren’t new to medicine. Many lab tests are, in fact, tests of biomarkers. Sugar or protein in a sample of urine can shed light on what’s happening in the kidneys or pancreas. The concentration of cholesterol in the blood may hint at disease in the arteries. What’s changed is medicine’s ability to measure more molecules, with greater precision and less cost, than was possible in the past. The result is a storehouse of information on millions of people, most of it available at the prick of a hypodermic needle. When the health and longevity of those people are correlated with the readings of their biomarkers, it becomes possible to find biomarker profiles that predict risk of future disease or early death. A recent attempt to do just that was described this year in the journal Aging Cell by Paola Sebastiani, a biostatistician at the Boston University School of Public Health. Her subjects were members of the Long Life Family Study — 5,000 people in 550 families with a predilection for longevity. The volunteers in the study were subjected to many blood tests. Sebastiani and her colleagues focused on 19 that proved to be most informative. The tests included common ones (hemoglobin concentration, serum albumin) and exotic ones (C-reactive protein, insulinlike growth factor). Together, the tests shed light on six domains of physiology, including inflammation, kidney function and blood-sugar metabolism. A computer algorithm analyzed the test results in the thousands of volunteers and determined that they fell into 26 patterns, or clusters. Each cluster contained people with similar test results. The biggest one had 2,200 people, all of whom had test readings close to the average for the whole study population. They became the reference group. ""The methodology that I used is to look at multiple markers simultaneously, which is challenging. You have to have a lot of data to be able to do this,"" Sebastiani said. The researchers found the clusters differed from each other, and from the reference group, in their rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and premature death, and also in measures of aging, such as grip strength and walking speed. As expected, one cluster was considerably healthier than the average, with a low incidence of disease and early death. Its members seemed to have biological ages younger than their chronological ages. In short, the 19 blood tests together formed a biomarker that told people whether they were aging prematurely, and predicted in general terms the chances of developing serious illness or dying early. Sebastiani and her team then looked to see whether the biomarkers worked in a different population. They chose the Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart Study — several thousand men and women who had had blood tests done periodically since the 1970s. The biomarkers held up. They divided that population into clusters with the same patterns of disease risk, premature aging and early death as seen in the Long Life Family Study. The research didn’t address whether people could move from one biomarker cluster to another, and in so doing change their risk for a bad outcome. But Sebastiani suspects they can — and do. ""There are a lot of things you can do to improve biomarkers. They are not all hard-wired, like genetic mutations,"" she said. Such biomarker profiling would be useful in clinical trials of anti-aging treatments because it would allow researchers to measure the efficacy of a drug by seeing whether a person taking it shifted from a cluster with advanced biological age and elevated risk for disease, to a more youthful, lower-risk one. The more obvious use, however, is in the routine doctor visit, where it could provide patients a peek at what may lie ahead and a chance, Ebenezer Scroogelike, to alter their fates. There is, of course, much more in blood than what the Boston University researchers were looking at. For example, there are white blood cells containing thousands of genes in various states of activity. It turns out they, too, can be biomarkers. In a study published in 2009, Richard A. Kerber at the University of Louisville and two collaborators looked at 2,100 genes that are always turned on in cells, most of them doing molecular housekeeping. The researchers measured the amount of activity of each gene in blood samples drawn from about 100 people in the 1980s and then frozen. The people were 57 to 97 years old at the time. Even though all the genes were active, for many of them the amount of activity varied by a person’s age. In all, 10 percent tended to become more active as a person got older, and 6 percent became less active. Using that information, the researchers were able to say what biological age based on gene activity looked like for each year of middle and old age. Many of the people had since died — a fact that allowed the researchers to calculate what the risk of death had been over the decades for people with various biological ages at the time the blood was drawn. It turned out that for every ""extra"" year of biological age, a person’s risk of dying was about one-third higher than it would normally have been. For example, a 55-year-old with the gene-activity profile of a 56-year-old had a 33 percent greater risk of dying at age 55 than a 55-year-old person whose biological age matched his chronological age. As with the blood biomarkers, this one will probably be more useful as a signpost than as a crystal ball. ""I don’t think it’s ever going to be very accurate in terms of predicting how long someone is going to live,"" Kerber said. ""There are too many random factors; too much stuff can happen. But if it’s monitored at several time points, it could tell you whether you’re going in the right direction or not."" Other ways of measuring gene activity are also proving to be useful gauges of disease risk and longevity, at least in research studies. Just last month, a team of scientists led by Yan Zhang at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg reported that a phenomenon called DNA methylation may be one. In methylation, a methyl group (a cluster of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms) attaches to the DNA strand, repressing the gene at that spot. Patterns of methylation are strongly influenced by age, sex, and environmental and lifestyle exposures, including smoking and exercise. Methylation also plays a role in the onset and course of many chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders. The German team found that specific methylation patterns at just 10 sites (out of thousands), when measured in people in their 60s, strongly predicted a person’s risk of dying over the next 10 years. So, blood biomarkers that predict longevity — hemo-augury, you might call it — are a hot topic in medical research. But can they tell us anything useful that we don’t already know? Various studies have shown that genes are responsible for only 30 percent of our longevity. The other 70 percent is determined by diet, exercise, weight, habits such as smoking and drinking, family and social life, along with access to medical care, and luck. How much difference ­nongenetic factors can make is evident in the experience of ­Seventh-Day Adventists. The members of that Christian sect don’t smoke or drink, tend to be vegetarians and have strong family and church-community bonds. Life expectancy is 86 for Adventist men and 89 for of Adventist women, compared with 76 for American men overall and 81 for American women. Adventists come from many ethnic and racial backgrounds, so the big increase in longevity is presumably the consequence of behavior, not genes. ""What that says is that we humans have, on average, a genetic blueprint that allows us to get to a very old age,"" said Thomas T. Perls, a geriatrician at Boston University who directs a study of very old people called the New England Centenarian Study. ""If we take advantage of that blueprint, we get to almost 90. If we fight it, then we’re going to die in our 50s or 60s."" Biomarkers that hint at our chances for a long life are scientifically interesting. Perls’s research, for example, has found that people who live to age 105 share many rare variants of just 130 genes out of the 20,000 they all carry. But as a practical matter, we don’t need to wait for ­hemo-augury to show up at our doctor’s office. We already know what to do to make ourselves healthier. Brown is a physician and journalist.","if it’s monitored at several time points, it could tell you whether you’re going in the right direction or not"

While it’s just a matter of another 24 hours, it’s still extremely special and much valued. It gets so much excitement and enthusiasm with it, that it just makes you forget about all the unch-neech that you went through throughout the week. But, there is one question that has been bothering us, for quite some time now and that is, WHY SUNDAY? Why is it a holiday on Sunday, and why not any other day of the week? We could have even had a Sunday on a Thursday, or a Tuesday or even better, a MONDAY. If you too have been eager to know as to why have we been having holiday on a Sunday then here’s the answer: Back in 1843, The British were the first ones who started holiday on Sunday in India. This was done because of the belief in Christianity that God created this world in 6 days, and took rest on Sunday. Since the Christians also pray in church every Sunday, Sunday is a holiday in Christianity. However, it is said that the concept of weekly holiday earlier differed from nation to nation, depending on the ""Sabbath"" day. The day on which people would take rest from other duties was known was the ""Sabbath"" day (seventh day adventist). Hence, this day has been observed by them as a weekly holiday since then and the practice continues till date, in all places where the British ruled, including India. Now go enjoy your Sunday, folks!","the belief in Christianity that God created this world in 6 days, and took rest on Sunday.

1535,"The UK’s coolest city by the sea is taking the lead on locally sourced, ethical bites – we recommend tucking in Brighton has always done its own thing, a hub for the independent, alternative and oddball, considered by many to be coolest city in the UK. So it should come as little surprise that, instead of blindly following the foodie fads of London (gourmet ramen, filthy burgers, ad infinitum), its food scene has developed a more independent spirit – one propelled by firmly held beliefs about local, organic, sustainable produce. Only, Brighton types don’t just say those are their principles – they really live them.   For proof, I joined the V.I.B (Very Independent Brighton) Food Tour, run by local foodies Angela Brightwell and Catriona Lane. The pair launched the walking tour in April this year to provide a guide to both eating well in Brighton and the unique parts of the city that tourists are likely to miss. And while ""independent"" has become synonymous with ""expensive"" in London, Angela and Cat are staunch believers that choosing ""indie"" shouldn’t mean blowing wads of cash, so all of the stops offer reasonably priced food and drink.  Here’s what I learned along the way. I’ve been shopping the wrong way my whole life hiSbe, which stands for ""how it should be"", is a supermarket with a difference. A social enterprise model with a mission to run a completely ethical business, produce is locally sourced, fair trade, and, for every item scanned, a pie chart appears on the till showing exactly where the pennies you spend in there go (from paying staff and suppliers to overheads and profit). All staff members are paid above the living wage and for every pound spent here, 69 pence on average goes back to the producers.  So how can you explain the difference between the products sold here and those peddled in big chains? Cat took vegetables as an example. ""When opening supermarket-bought packets of vegetables or salad leaves, you might notice a puff of gas escaping from the packet,"" she said. ""That is chlorinated gas used to preserve the leaves, which doesn’t do much for the quality or taste.""  By contrast, leafy organic veg in hiSbe is sourced from Fletching Glasshouses, which grows produce under two acres of glass at Fletching Common in Sussex, before packing it without any gas or preservatives. According to Cat, that means it doesn’t turn into the liquid mush supermarket-bought spinach and other leaves can when they invariably wither away within 48 hours. You can also buy individual pieces of fruit or vegetables here instead of buying them in bulk, which reduces waste.  Oysters are actually delicious – and good for digestion My tour group was made up entirely of nervous oyster virgins, so we worked up the courage to sample our first with a glass of wine while sitting at the bar inside English’s of Brighton, the city’s oldest seafood restaurant. According to Jonathan Speirs, head oyster shucker, the key to enjoying your first oyster is to top it with red wine vinegar and chopped shallots, as this takes the edge off the seawater flavour.  Oysters are back in vogue among younger generations thanks to the growing popularity of sushi, Jonathan reckons. ""It used to be very much the old codgers but then in the last 10, 15 years we’ve got busier and busier and more and more young people are coming in here,"" he told me. Oysters also sit nicely under the wellness umbrella now so important to millennials, Jonathan added. ""It is very kind on your digestion. All this meat is quite tiring because your body has to work very hard to digest. Oysters are gentle and full of magnesium and iron and are really good for you. You will feel the goodness going into you.""   Of course a major issue with seafood is sustainability. English’s source their oysters from sustainable fisheries around the British Isles, such as the Fal River oyster fishery, which harvests organic, native specimens from wild and natural beds. Such fisheries help with the upkeep of oysters’ natural habitats around Britain’s coastline and estuaries.  ""Fish is expensive now,"" Jonathan added, ""and we use sustainable sources, so obviously our menu does look expensive. But it is done responsibly and freshly. Even down to our cod and chips: the guy who delivers the fresh cod from the sustainable source said we were the only restaurant he actually delivers fresh cod to.""  Plus, come here and you’ll be in good company – Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench are fans. Cooked oysters start at £9.45 for three.  Supermarket hummus is the worst Smorl’s Houmous Falafel & Salad Bar offers homemade, organic, vegan, ""anti-supermarket"" hummus, available in varying garlicky intensities; two years after launching, it’s now so popular that brother and sister duo Sarah and Christian make and distribute between 90 and 100 kilos of this hummus around Brighton every week.  So what makes it ""anti-supermarket""? ""You can buy a pot of insipid paste in the supermarket for a quid and it’s just not what it should be,"" Christian said. He’s passionate about only using organic ingredients and painstakingly carrying out each part of the hummus-making process by hand. ""My sister worked for an Israeli guy in a tent in Glastonbury making hummus and falafel and they used a bicycle to grind the chickpeas in the middle of a field,"" he recalled. ""She learnt an early recipe from him and has been playing with it ever since."" Their recipe includes Kombu seaweed foraged from the Cornish coast as well as 100 per cent organic chickpeas. ""We get a lot of our raw materials from Infinity Foods Co-Operative and then I sell it back to them,"" he explained. ""We hand-peel half the garlic and oven roast the other half, then we blend them together, so there is a lot of roast garlickiness going on. We use fresh herbs: coriander, parsley, cumin."" Unlike supermarket brands of hummus, Smorl’s is preservative-free and has a strict 10-day shelf-life.  Located in Brighton’s Open Market, Smorl’s famous hummus pots are available in four varieties: original, extra garlic, thunder garlic and fresh chilli. Pots cost from £2.20.  You don’t have to drink coffee to wake up   Caffeine addicts who can’t imagine starting the day without a cup of coffee but then struggle against the inevitable midday crash should pay a visit to Bluebird Tea Co. Their matcha tea drinks – served up by ""tea mixologists""– promise the same buzz, but without the mid-morning slump. A cult green tea in Japan, matcha – which is powdered – boosts metabolism and contains more potent antioxidants than those found in traditional green tea. Each shot of matcha provides around 34mg of caffeine, around half of the caffeine kick delivered in an espresso, but the amino acid and L-Theanine ensure the effects last longer. Try an almond milk matcha latte or a matcha lemonade.  The shop also sells different types of tea in a range of unorthodox flavours – I recommend the bananas and custard, Christmas cake, mulled cider and cherry Bakewell varieties. #cleaneating is for suckers A welcome antidote to clean eating obsessions, the Brighton Sausage Co is a cheese and meat deli that shifts up to 30 kilos of their famous stilton at Christmas. All produce here is free range and locally sourced, with owners going no further than Kent to fill their shelves. As well as all the fantastic fromage, the deli is known for its sausages, produced using cuts of free-range lean pork shoulder and back fat from Sussex farms (staff recommend the smoked pork and red onion variety). Then there’s the signature sausage rolls – three hundred of these bad boys fly off their shelves every Saturday.

1544,"In Gujarat's capital, Gandhinagar, a peon with the Gujarat Water Resources Development Corporation (GWRDC) Ltd. has been found to be owning seven properties — three flats, an office space and three land plots — and two cars. These assets are valued at Rs 1.18 crore on paper, while their market value is pegged at multiple crores. Gujarat Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Friday and Saturday registered five cases of disproportionate assets (DA) in Gandhinagar, Rajkot and Sabarkantha, for a total value of Rs 14.17 crore. One of the cases, worth Rs 11.56 crore, forms the lions share of the sum. ACB officials said Hasmukh Rawal, a peon with GWRDC, was found to have assets disproportionate by Rs 1.18 crore after scrutiny of his sources of income and properties bought between April 2004 and March 2016. According to the case details, Rawal has three properties, at Green Park Society and Ambika Apartment in Gandhinagar and Riddhi Siddhi Apartment at Pethapur, an office in Radhe Square at Dholakuwa Crossroads and three plots in Chiloda and Isanpur.

A search at his residence on Saturday by a Mehsana unit fetched gold ornaments worth Rs 12.53 lakh and other valuables worth Rs 3.82 lakh,"" said an official. In another case, Bharatgiri Goswami, associated with the HR department of GSPC, is named in a DA case of Rs 11.56 crore, an amount 2,489.89% of his income. ""Goswami was found to own an apartment in Akshar Apartments and a plot in Sector 1 at Gandhinagar, another plot at Kanva Society in Koba, seven pieces of farmland in Pethapur and a piece of farmland in Alampur near Gandhinagar. We have taken into consideration the period from 2004 to 2015 for the assessment,"" said an ACB official. Sources said that Goswami has left the government organization to join a corporate house. The ACB's Sabarkantha unit on Friday registered a case against Prakashchandra Patel, field assistant (land acquisition) with Gujarat Land Development Corporation, Himmatnagar for DA of Rs 33.09 lakh, which is 157.35% more than his income for the period between 2008 and 2015. ""His properties include four agricultural land parcels, five residential plots, 70g of gold ornaments and one car,"" said an official. The ACB team of Rajkot (rural) filed a complaint against Anilkumar Makadia, deputy mamlatdar at Dhoraji. Investigators said Makadia was found to have assets 97.9% greater, at Rs 40.66 lakh, against his known sources of income. Another team in Rajkot city registered a case against Chandrika Vadher, former principal of Dharmendrasinhji College in Rajkot for DA of Rs 68.98 lakh, which is 83% more than her income. Vadher was trapped in a corruption case in August 2016 after which an inquiry was started against her. ACB officials said that these cases took place on the basis of secret investigations carried out by various field teams. ""We had got complaints in person and through the helpline. We also took into consideration trap cases, to start investigations. A second round will involve searches at each person's home and scrutiny of bank accounts to find out details of more properties if any,"" said a senior ACB official. This is the third major drive by ACB to record DA cases in two years, he added. A team from the Mehsana unit of ACB conducted a search at Goswami's residence on Saturday evening. While Goswami was not at home as he was in Navsari for a wedding, the team found Rs 8 lakh cash in Rs 2,000 notes. ""A separate probe can take place to ascertain their source as the currency notes are in serial number. As the amount is large, other agencies will be intimated,"" said an official.","ACB officials said Hasmukh Rawal, a peon with GWRDC, was found to have assets disproportionate by Rs 1.18 crore after scrutiny of his sources of income and properties bought between April 2004 and March 2016"

If you’ve ever used Google maps to research a place you’re travelling to, you’ll know that it is a great resource. You can often see the most minute of details, and get a real feel for a place before you get there. But this image proves that even the most powerful tools sometimes mess up in quite strange ways. Can you see what’s wrong with this image? Imgur • Reddit In the viral image, the woman's legs appear to be the wrong way around At first look, the image of a woman sun bathing in her bikini appears innocent - reading her book, and lying on her front, she looks relaxed and happy. However once you spot the difference, you can see that this is no ordinary image, because the woman’s legs are on the wrong way. Don’t worry though, this is not a freak accident, the image has simply merged an image of her lying down on her back before meshing with her as she switched over to her front. As such, it makes for a unique picture and not one that would encourage you to head to the beach in question. The image has garnered over half a million views already, with hundreds of comments about what could have caused the strange composition. One commenter suggested that the image issue is due to the woman ""turning over in the middle of someone taking a panoramic shot"", whereas another counters with ""literally can see here it was two half (sic) of separate images...or she also has a hand growing out of her side too"" Scary stuff, and hopefully not indicative of a trip to this Costa Rican beach.

1552,"Why Local Bands Never Become National Bands I’ve always hated the term ""local band."" It’s usually taken as an insult even if it’s not meant to be. It infers that no one outside of the confines of your hometown has ever heard of you. Not ""no one"" in the sense of ""no one has ever heard of Aleppo."" Clearly, many people have, even if most people (or a presidential candidate) haven’t. I’m talking literally no one. Even in our globally connected world where internet stars with day jobs are commonplace, people still heavily use the term ‘local band.’ But what really defines a ‘local band’ in the NEW music business? A local band is a musical act that has not built a fan base outside of their home state. And has no plans to. There are the ""weekend warriors"" who are musicians with day jobs and ""tour"" only on the weekends — typically visiting neighboring cities. Local bands occasionally cross state lines. But this does not qualify them to remove the ""local band"" medal of shame unless they are structuring their game plans on bigger and better. Believe me, I had that medal strangling my neck for a couple years before I figured out how throw it into a SoCal brush fire. The thing is with local bands is they don’t seem to be able to see 5 feet in front of their drink ticket covered eyeballs. Now, this isn’t to say they cannot and will not ever become national acts. Remember, every national act was once a local act. But, the problem is most local bands bitch about why they aren’t getting the ‘breaks’ they think they deserve to be getting without stepping back and understanding why they aren’t able to move their careers further along. In the new music business, luck has nothing to do with it. You make your own success. Sure, there are little victories here and there that may seem like lucky breaks, but luck is simply when preparation meets opportunity. Most local bands simply don’t have the preparation part down. And there’s no excuse for that. I once lived with 5 musicians in a house in Minneapolis. We were each in different projects and traded off nights of the week where our bands would rehearse in the basement. One of the guys I lived with, Michael, had a 9 to 5 office job. He went straight from college graduation to this pencil pushing position. He was also in a local band that played a residency at a bar every Thursday night. Every day he came home from work at around 5:30, ate a quick dinner and then locked himself in his room with his electric guitar, popped on his practice headphone contraption and practiced until he went to bed at midnight. 6 hours. Every night (except Thursdays and band rehearsal Wednesdays). While parties happened on the other side of his door he was hard at work. When he started his day job, he was a mediocre guitar player. But a year later, after spending nearly every night practicing his ass off, he quit his job and helped take his band from being just a local bar band to touring the country, selling out venues most places they went. This didn’t just happen either. And they received very few ""lucky breaks"" (if any, honestly). To ‘make it’ in music requires an obsessive desire to be great. Not famous. Great. And most musicians are, simply, not great. They’re good enough to bring friends and family out to their local shows, but not great to the point where they are simply undeniable. You can have the business skills of Troy Carter, but it means nothing if you don’t have a product that people want. The product, in this case, is your music. Whether it’s your live show or your recorded music, some aspect of your project needs to be great. And it’s not about natural talent. Michael had less natural talent than many of his counterparts. But he worked harder than them and quickly surpassed them. ""People don’t understand that when I grew up, I was never the most talented. I was never the biggest. I was never the fastest, and certainly was never the strongest. The only thing I had was my work ethic, and that’s been what has gotten me this far."" – Tiger Woods So, stop pushing your shitty product. Get better first. And start pushing when you’re ready. Yes, play out as much as you can. You can never have too much experience. Early on, you won’t be paid much for these performances because you don’t deserve to be, yet. Don’t take this as musicians don’t deserve to be paid. Shitty musicians don’t deserve to be paid (yet). Know your worth. If you literally have no one willing to pay you to perform (or buy tickets to watch you perform) you are probably not ready to be paid. So stop bitching about not being paid and get better. But all you shady ass pay-to-play promoters out there, this does not give you a pass to convince naive local bands to pay you to get on a stage for experience. This is a slimy practice and you know it. +Should You Pay to Play? Here Are The Worst to Best Club Deals In The World All you local bands paying to play. There are better ways to get experience that doesn’t perpetuate this practice. Play charity events. Play teen centers. College events. Offer to play at bars for food and drinks. Don’t force your friends to buy tickets to come see you suck. They aren’t going to appreciate that. It’s a lose-lose for everyone involved (except the promoter who makes out handsomely). How do you know when you’re ready? Well, you’ll know. Eventually there will be more people in the crowd digging what you’re putting out who you don’t know than you do. Randoms will go out of their way once you finish to come up to you and tell you how much you moved them. Randoms will ask where they can find your music. They’ll start to follow you on all social channels and want to see you again. At that point, you’re ready to take your show on the road. How do you know when you recorded music is great? Well, this used to be extremely difficult to get an honest response from anyone. Your friends and mom will always tell you what you want to hear. Use market research platforms like AudioKite, Sound Out, Tunecore’s Fan Reviews, ReverbNation’s Crowd Review or the ""industry professionals"" on Fluence or Music Xray for unbiased opinions. If you’re consistently scoring in the bottom 50th percentile, you’re not ready yet. That score means that you are worse than 50% of all music ever reviewed on these services. And a lot of music has been reviewed on these services. Once you start consistently scoring in the 90th percentile and above, then you’re ready to take all the business knowledge you’ve learned from doing your homework and start turning yourself into a nationally known and respected artist.

1555,"China's capital is notorious for its chronic pollution. Even indoors it's a struggle to find clean air, says John Sudworth. Having already taped most of my windows shut, I have now started on the air conditioning vents. The aim is simple - to close off every access point through which the toxic outside air leaks into our Beijing home. Even our double-glazing doesn't keep out the smog. The most dangerous constituent, particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter - or PM2.5 as it's known - finds a way through the tiniest of gaps where the windows close. So the only solution there is duct tape. It's like a re-enactment of a 1970s government information film on surviving a nuclear holocaust. Only it's not radiation we're trying to keep at bay, but the fallout from fossil fuels. The most useful device in our armoury is our PM2.5 monitor. We have two, one upstairs and one downstairs, which we glance at frequently, and it was their arrival that prompted the frenzy of taping and draught-excluding that continues to this day. When I first arrived in China, five years ago, there was no way of monitoring the quality of air in our home. Like everyone else, we left it to blind faith that our air purifiers were doing the trick. It now transpires they weren't. Even now on highly polluted days, we struggle to get our PM2.5 count much below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the World Health Organization's maximum standard for safe air. And that's with multiple purifiers running at full tilt, large box-like machines that sit in the corner of every room - two in some - the combined noise output of which is akin to living in the engine room of an aircraft carrier. China's air pollution problem is now so bad that its effects are measured in more than a million premature deaths a year and markedly reduced life expectancy - an average of more than five years or so - in the worst-affected regions. Over the past few weeks, a period of particularly acute and prolonged air pollution, the average air quality in Beijing has been well above 200 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic metre - many times the maximum safe limit. During the worst of it, it's been like living under house arrest, our children confined to the small, deafening but breathable indoor space of our home for days on end. And across China, the smog becomes a dominant topic on social media, with the population tracking the foulness of the air via mobile phone apps. One group of Beijing mothers, armed with their own PM2.5 counters, have even been roaming the city in search of shopping malls or cafes with filtered air - and then sharing their discoveries online. Of course, humanity's dependence on oil and coal long predate China's economic rise. But China offers a vision of environmental degradation far in excess of the pea-souper fogs of 1950s London or Manchester. For much of the past month the cloud of toxic air hanging over this country has extended for thousands of miles, a giant, continent-sized cocktail of soot from coal fired power stations and car exhausts, smothering the lives and filling the lungs of hundreds of millions of people. While growing awareness means that more of them are now taking action to protect their health, many others are either not fully informed about the danger or don't have the means to do much about it. A set of new filters for a single air purifier can cost £100 ($120) or more and needs changing every six months or so. It is, of course, not a problem only of China's making. The smartphones, computers, TV screens, jeans and shoes that have been pouring out of its factories over the past few decades are cheap, in part at least, precisely because they're made without environmental safeguards. The interests of the rich world and an unaccountable Chinese Communist elite have neatly dovetailed. The West gets its cheap consumer desirables and China gets rich without the inconvenience of the independent scrutiny, regulation or democratic oversight of other markets. The true cost is measured by the numbers on my pollution monitors, and it is one being borne disproportionately by ordinary Chinese people. Following a crackdown on a rare protest against pollution in the central city of Chengdu recently, one blogger dared to speak out in favour of the protesters. The police, he suggested, should bear in mind that the elites, whose interests they protect, have sent their families to breathe clean air overseas. He was promptly detained.",China's air pollution problem is now so bad that its effects are measured in more than a million premature deaths a year and markedly reduced life expectancy - an average of more than five years or so - in the worst-affected regions.
1557,"Last week, McKenna Pilling, an 18-year-old from New York currently attending Utah State University, was moving out of her dorm. While she was moving out, Pilling told BuzzFeed News, her mom, Deanna, decided to surprise her with a visit. Only, it didn't go exactly as planned. ""She came to surprise me from New York City to help clean out my dorm and apparently walked in the wrong dorm,"" Pilling told BuzzFeed News. ""No one was in there so she laid down for five minutes in the wrong bed and decided to send me a picture as a surprise."" Pilling said she immediately knew her mom wasn't taking a selfie from her bed because that's where she was. She said her mom immediately felt sick to her stomach and ran out of the room. Pilling tweeted her mom's amazing text, though, and as of Monday, it's been retweeted over 11,000 times. ""My intention was only for family and friends to see, hence the caption, 'Momma Pilling at it again,' because the people I know know her as 'Momma Pilling',"" Pilling said.

1564,"High above the Pacific Ocean in a plane headed for Hong Kong, most of the passengers are fast asleep. But not Jim Puckett. His eyes are fixed on the glowing screen of his laptop. Little orange markers dot a satellite image. He squints at the pixelated terrain trying to make out telltale signs. He’s searching for America’s electronic waste. ""People have the right to know where their stuff goes,"" he says. Dead electronics make up the world’s fastest-growing source of waste. The United States produces more e-waste than any country in the world. Electronics contain toxic materials like lead and mercury, which can harm the environment and people. Americans send about 50,000 dump trucks worth of electronics to recyclers each year. But a two-year investigation by the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based e-waste watchdog group, concluded that sometimes businesses are exporting electronics rather than recycling them. Puckett’s organization partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to put 200 geolocating tracking devices inside old computers, TVs and printers. They dropped them off nationwide at donation centers, recyclers and electronic take-back programs — enterprises that advertise themselves as ""green,"" ""sustainable,"" ""earth friendly"" and ""environmentally responsible."" ""The trackers are like miniature cell phones,"" he said. ""The little devices went out and spoke to us, called home regularly, saying ‘this is where I am.’"" About a third of the tracked electronics went overseas — some as far as 12,000 miles. That includes six of the 14 tracker-equipped electronics that Puckett’s group dropped off to be recycled in Washington and Oregon. The tracked electronics ended up in Mexico, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Canada and Kenya. Most often, they traveled across the Pacific to rural Hong Kong. It’s the same route Puckett is taking now. Undercover In The New Territories The next morning Puckett follows the little orange markers to a region of Hong Kong called the New Territories, a long-time agricultural area along the border with mainland China that’s shifted toward industry in recent decades. He teams up with a Chinese journalist and translator, Dongxia Su, and a local driver, who will help navigate the region. They follow a set of GPS coordinates for one of the tracked electronics. Paved streets become rutted dirt roads. They pass a steady stream of trucks carrying shipping containers from the port. As they approach their first destination — ""One-hundred feet away. Eighty feet. Seventy-seven feet,"" Puckett says — they hear sounds of power drills and shattering glass. It’s coming from the other side of a high metal wall made from old shipping containers. ""It should be in this yard here,"" Puckett says, pointing toward the fence. ""Forty feet away."" Su pounds on the front gate, and the drilling stops. A worker shouts from beyond the fence and Su tells him the group is shopping for used electronics. She says they want to fill a shipping container with printers to refurbish and sell in Pakistan. The door opens. Inside, workers are dismantling LCD TVs. The ground at their feet is littered with broken white tubes. These fluorescent lamps were made to light up flat-screens. When they break they release invisible mercury vapor. Even a minuscule amount of mercury can be a neurotoxin. The workers aren’t wearing protective face masks. One worker says he isn’t aware of the risks. ""He had no idea,"" Su says, after speaking with him in Mandarin. The New Territories used to serve only as a pass-through for smuggled e-waste, Puckett said, where workers would unload shipping containers and put electronics on smaller trucks bound for mainland China. But a crackdown by the Chinese government on whole electronic imports, part of a border control operation called ""Green Fence,"" has prevented many electronics from moving across the border. ""Now they’re doing the processing here,"" he said. Puckett has been investigating the afterlife of consumer electronics for nearly two decades. Over the years, his team staked out U.S. recycling operations and followed shipping containers overseas to uncover the environmental and human health consequences of the global e-waste trade. Many U.S. consumers got their first glimpse of what happens to their discarded electronics in Puckett’s 2001 film ""Exporting Harm: The High-Tech Trashing of Asia."" It captured the crude recycling methods taking place in Guiyu, a cluster of villages in southeastern China that has since become known as the world’s biggest graveyard for America’s electronic junk. In the video, villagers desoldered circuit boards over coal-fired grills, burned plastic casings off wires to extract copper, and mined gold by soaking computer chips in black pools of hydrochloric acid. Researchers later found the region had some of the highest levels of cancer-causing dioxins in the world due to its e-waste industry.1 Puckett’s documentary came out more than a decade after nearly every developed nation on the globe had ratified the Basel Convention, an international treaty to stop developed countries from dumping hazardous waste on poorer nations. Now, more than a quarter-century after that treaty was written, and more than 15 years since he exposed Guiyu, Puckett said little has changed. The United States is the only industrialized country in the world that hasn’t ratified the treaty. Its hazardous waste is still getting exported to countries with fewer health and environmental safety laws, according to Puckett’s latest investigation. ""It’s still a dirty little secret,"" Puckett said. ""It’s still a story that needs to be told."" Over the years Puckett’s attempts to quantify and draw attention to exported electronic waste has drawn criticism from U.S. recyclers who say the problem has been exaggerated. ""The vast majority of electronics collected for recycling in the U.S. are recycled in the U.S.,"" said Eric Harris of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a Washington, D.C.-based recycling trade association. ""We would really challenge the notion that there’s a mass exodus of equipment that’s leaving in an unprocessed manner."" Estimates of U.S. e-waste exports vary widely. The United Nations says that between 10 and 40 percent of U.S. e-waste gets exported for dismantling. While the International Trade Commission — through a survey of recyclers — said in 2013 that a mere 0.13 percent of all used electronics collected in the U.S. went abroad for dismantling. Puckett turned to GPS tracking technology as a new tool to determine just how big the e-waste export problem really might be. He partnered with Carlo Ratti of the Senseable City Lab at MIT to deploy the strategy. ""Tracking is really the first step in order to design a better system,"" Ratti said. ""One of the surprising things we discovered is how far waste travels. You see this kind of global e-waste flow that actually almost covered the whole planet."" Unlicensed And Unregulated Puckett’s GPS receiver leads the way to another set of high fences. A sign out front proclaims that it’s farmland. But a look over the fence reveals a lot the size of a football field piled 15 feet high with printers. Workers are breaking them. Their clothes are dusted black with toner ink, a probable carcinogen known to cause respiratory problems. Su talks to the workers and finds out many are migrants from mainland China, who are residing in Hong Kong without the official documents required for them to legally be there, she says. ""There is no protection of this labor force,"" Puckett says. ""There are no occupational laws that are going to protect them."" That doesn’t surprise Jackson Lau, director of the Hong Kong Recycle Materials and Reproduction Business General Association. ""The majority of these workshops tend to operate in a shady manner,"" unlicensed and poorly regulated, said Lau, a licensed, second-generation paper and plastics recycler in the region. Electronics are often labeled as raw plastics to get through customs, Lau said, but they’re actually whole devices that the junkyard workers dismantle. They sell the most valuable components to buyers in mainland China, while workers indiscriminately dump the worthless leftovers. He said a lack of oversight by Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department is not only harming workers in the facilities but also the neighboring communities and environment. Several fires have broken out at junkyards in the past year, including two incidents in March that emitted plumes of toxic black smoke, according to local news reports. Burning e-waste is known to generate dioxins, a family of cancer-causing chemicals that endure for long periods of time in the environment and human body. More than a month after the fires, rusty metals and ashen plastics still emit chemical odors and blanket the soil along a nearby river. Cheung Kwai Choi, a farmer who has lived in the region for a half-century, said the e-waste junkyards and fires have multiplied in recent years. ""When I was young, I used to drink water directly from the river,"" he said through an interpreter. ""Now I do not even dare drink water from the well."" He recently began advocating for stronger regulations on junkyards. ""I really hope that our land has not been contaminated,"" Cheung said. ""And that our village will not be plagued by cancer, like the ones discovered in mainland China."" Hong Kong bans the import of hazardous e-waste like cathode ray tubes and flat-screens from the United States and other developed nations, according to Environmental Protection Department spokesperson Heidi Liu.2 ""On the whole, Hong Kong has been effective in combating hazardous waste shipments,"" Liu said, citing 21 instances in the past three years in which cargo loads of e-waste were sent back to the U.S. Even The Most Reputable Recyclers Export At two junkyards, Puckett finds labels from a library, a hospital and other organizations in Washington and Oregon. ""It’s getting close to home,"" he says. Then he finds a clue as to how these materials ended up here. Many boxes bear the logo for Total Reclaim, one of the largest electronics recyclers in the Pacific Northwest with contracts to handle e-waste from the City of Seattle,King County, the University of Washington and the State of Washington.3 It is also one of the larger recyclers operating in Oregon. Total Reclaim scored these big regional recycling contracts in part because it was certified by e-Stewards, a responsible-recycling certification program created by Puckett’s Basel Action Network. Puckett started e-Stewards in 2010 to create a set of ethical and environmentally-friendly industry standards and prevent the export of toxic materials in lieu of federal laws. Total Reclaim was a founding member. Electronics recyclers with e-Stewards certification can export the raw plastics and metals that come from dismantling electronics. But they adopt a strict no-export policy with regard to whole electronics with hazardous materials still inside. Recyclers can also exported used electronics as long as they’ve been tested and proven to be still functioning. Last May Puckett’s team dropped two non-working LCD TVs, with tracking devices placed inside, at separate recyclers in Oregon. From there, the tracked electronics traveled to Total Reclaim’s warehouse in south Seattle. Then they went to the Port of Seattle, across the Pacific Ocean to the Port of Hong Kong and ultimately to two junkyards in the New Territories. Workers at those junkyards said they import and dismantle LCDs from the United States. Total Reclaim wasn’t the only leading domestic e-waste recycler that collected non-working electronics with tracking devices inside that went overseas, the Basel Action Network concluded through its investigation. In 2004 Dell created a take-back program called Dell Reconnect. That made it the first major computer manufacturer to ban the export of non-working electronics to developing countries. The computer maker partners with the nonprofit thrift store chain Goodwill Industries, which collects any brand of old computer for free to be refurbished or recycled. The investigation focused on Dell’s program after whistleblowers drew Puckett’s attention. BAN dropped off 28 tracked electronics at participating Goodwill locations and determined that six of the tracking devices went abroad — to Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China and Thailand. Puckett followed those tracking devices overseas to junkyards in Hong Kong and Taiwan that import and dismantle whole electronics.4 Beth Johnson, head of Dell’s producer responsibility programs, said the company conducts regular audits of Goodwill and vets downstream recycling partners. ""If there’s something that did not follow the system we would certainly want to know about it and certainly take corrective action,"" Johnson said. Goodwill’s public relations official declined requests for an interview and instead issued a statement Friday after Puckett briefed officials about the findings of his group’s investigation. ""Goodwill Industries International is committed to understanding new insights into the e-cycling space from the final report,"" the statement said, and ""encourages Goodwill organizations participating in the Dell Reconnect program to evaluate the continuation of their contracts with Dell"" and to take steps to ensure that electronics are responsibly recycled. In all, BAN’s investigation found that 65 tracked devices went through U.S. recyclers and ended up overseas. The results showed that some of those exported electronics had been dropped off at green-certified recyclers. BAN plans to conduct further investigations before reporting more about these recyclers. ""I’m getting disillusioned by certification programs,"" Puckett said. ""It is clear that these certifications need to be better enforced and we intend to do just that."" On Thursday, the Basel Action Network announced that Total Reclaim was suspended from the e-Stewards program for two years. In a phone interview, co-owner Craig Lorch acknowledged that some of Total Reclaim’s LCD flatscreen monitors have been shipped to Hong Kong, despite the company’s no-export policy. ""Our stuff was over there,"" Lorch said. ""We take responsibility for that and the mistakes we’ve made."" Both the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Washington Department of Ecology have launched investigations into whether Total Reclaim violated their state hazardous waste laws. Oregon regulators have also asked the state Department of Justice to open an investigation into whether Total Reclaim violated consumer protection laws. Lorch said economic realities forced the company to renege on pledges to recycle all the waste that they collect. In recent years, LCD monitors have become a larger portion of the waste stream, but the flat-screens are expensive and time-consuming to dismantle. ""We’re struggling for survival,"" he said. Bear Market For Commodities Prices for many commodities found in e-waste, a major source of revenue for electronics recyclers, have plunged in the past year. In January, copper fetched half its 2011 price, hitting the lowest level in seven years. Plastics prices have bottomed out, recyclers say. At the height of the market, Total Reclaim sold steel for $300 a ton. The price recently fell to $60 a ton, Lorch said. Harris, from the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, said those falling commodity prices have put many companies in trouble. ""The last several years have been some of the most difficult times that the recycling industry has seen in decades,"" he said. In a bear market for commodities, exporting waste is more profitable than processing it domestically. Recyclers simply fill a shipping container with whole electronics and an e-waste broker arranges for pick up. Printers, which hold little value, and LCD TVs, which are expensive to recycle because of the tedious dismantling work associated with mercury, make good candidates for export. ""This e-waste recycling business is like the wild, wild west,"" said Wendy Neu, a 30-year veteran of the recycling and scrap metal industry. ""People are getting paid to recycle these materials through government programs and then are exporting to China and Africa."" Neu is the CEO of Hugo Neu, a New York-based e-waste recycler and e-Steward, that just months ago decided to shift its business model away from recycling. Now it only refurbishes electronics for resale. Neu, a board member of BAN, said they couldn’t compete with recyclers that spent pennies on the pound to export, while Neu’s company hired workers and paid for the latest advanced recycling technology. ""The industry is not going to survive as is under the current system,"" Neu said. Patchwork Of Laws The United States has no federal laws banning the export of e-waste.5 Bills have repeatedly failed to gain traction in Congress going back to the 1990s. The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries has opposed versions of those bills, arguing that these types of laws on exports would harm the recycling sector and are unnecessary because the industry is well-regulated by existing federal and state laws.6 The country is home to a patchwork of state laws. In half of states, landfilling electronics is legal. Some states, including Washington and Oregon, have paired landfill bans with laws that incentivize local recycling. The two Northwest states use ""producer responsibility"" laws similar to those in the European Union. Electronics manufacturers pay a fee to the state on electronics sold locally. The money helps subsidize approved recyclers like Total Reclaim, which recoup money through the program based on the amount of electronics the company collects. The laws aim to prevent dumping locally and abroad, assuring the public that obsolete electronics won’t get sent to third-world countries. ""States are supposed to do audits that should preclude that behavior,"" Harris said. But according to BAN’s tracking data, even audited companies were found to be exporting, including some in Oregon, Washington, California, Michigan and New Jersey. In addition, states don’t have jurisdiction to ban exports. ""There’s definitely not enough perp walks being done,"" said John Shegerian, chief executive of Electronics Recycling International, the largest e-waste recycling firm in the country. ""We need to step up enforcement to match the certification programs we have."" Until that happens, Puckett said he assumes the problem will get worse. About 20,000 new electronic devices will be released to U.S. consumers this year. More than 1.4 billion smartphones will be sold globally, five times the amount sold five years ago. Like LCDs, CRT monitors and printers, some of those electronics may present new economic challenges for recyclers. ""Until we solve this, we’ve got to keep going,"" Puckett said. It’s been almost 20 years since Puckett started this fight. He said he hopes it doesn’t take another 20 to end it. 1. A study by the Hong Kong Baptist University found surface soils in Guiyu had high levels of cancer-causing dioxins.

1565,"A passport from a European Union country confers the right to live and work in any other EU nation, and soon UK citizens will lose that right. After the Leave vote, some speculated that they could renew their passport immediately and remain a citizen of the EU for the next 10 years. That option will not work. Even though the cover of a British passport reads ""European Union"" at the top, when the UK leaves Europe, it ceases to be an EU passport. Accordingly, many people will decide it is rational to seek an alternative passport. But how difficult is it? The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent. It doesn't matter if they were born in the Republic or Northern Ireland; it's the island of Ireland that counts. The government in Dublin says: ""If either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of your place of birth. If you were born outside Ireland to an Irish citizen who was himself or herself born outside Ireland, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen."" David Cameron resigns as PM Even if neither of your parents is an Irish citizen, you can go back another generation: to citizenship through descent from Irish grandparents. The Irish government says if one of your grandparents is an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, you can have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register - and, ""If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration."" This lineage can continue through the generations: if you are (or become) an Irish citizen, this status can be passed on ""by each generation ensuring their registration in the Foreign Births Register before the birth of the next generation"". 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you 6 show all 6 ways Britain leaving the EU will affect you 1/6 More expensive foreign holidays The first practical effect of a vote to Leave is that the pound will be worth less abroad, meaning foreign holidays will cost us more nito100 2/6 No immediate change in immigration status The Prime Minister will have to address other immediate concerns. He is likely to reassure nationals of other EU countries living in the UK that their status is unchanged. That is what the Leave campaign has said, so, even after the Brexit negotiations are complete, those who are already in the UK would be allowed to stay Getty 3/6 Higher inflation A lower pound means that imports would become more expensive. This is likely to mean the return of inflation – a phenomenon with which many of us are unfamiliar because prices have been stable for so long, rising at no more than about 2 per cent a year. The effect may probably not be particularly noticeable in the first few months. At first price rises would be confined to imported goods – food and clothes being the most obvious – but inflation has a tendency to spread and to gain its own momentum AFP/Getty Images 4/6 Interest rates might rise The trouble with inflation is that the Bank of England has a legal obligation to keep it as close to 2 per cent a year as possible. If a fall in the pound threatens to push prices up faster than this, the Bank will raise interest rates. This acts against inflation in three ways. First, it makes the pound more attractive, because deposits in pounds will earn higher interest. Second, it reduces demand by putting up the cost of borrowing, and especially by taking larger mortgage payments out of the economy. Third, it makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow to expand output Getty 5/6 Did somebody say recession? Mr Carney, the Treasury and a range of international economists have warned about this. Many Leave voters appear not to have believed them, or to think that they are exaggerating small, long-term effects. But there is no doubt that the Leave vote is a negative shock to the economy. This is because it changes expectations about the economy’s future performance. Even though Britain is not actually be leaving the EU for at least two years, companies and investors will start to move money out of Britain, or to scale back plans for expansion, because they are less confident about what would happen after 2018 AFP/Getty Images 6/6 And we wouldn’t even get our money back All this will be happening while the Prime Minister, whoever he or she is, is negotiating the terms of our future access to the EU single market. In the meantime, our trade with the EU would be unaffected, except that companies elsewhere in the EU may be less interested in buying from us or selling to us, expecting tariff barriers to go up in two years’ time. Whoever the Chancellor is, he or she may feel the need to bring in a new Budget Getty Images If your genes are geopolitically unhelpful, the next possible route to an EU passport is marriage. But don’t expect instant results. Each country makes its own rules on how long it takes to acquire citizenship, and they are generally designed to avoid marriages of convenience. For example, the spouse of a citizen of Malta can become a citizen of the island only after five years of wedded bliss. The final option is open only to those with the right kind of bank balance: buying your way in to EU nationality, with a ""citizenship by investment"" scheme that many countries offer. According to KPMG, Cyprus is ""the ‘jurisdiction of choice’ for many high net worth individuals and their families"". The price tag is investing €5m in the island.",The easiest route for some will be to acquire Irish citizenship through descent - a process that is straightforward if you have the good fortune to have an Irish parent.

But one that might have been left out, is that the three-time world champion was also a pretty impressive troll. Speaking in an interview to the BBC, sports commentator Ronnie Nathanielsz, who was assigned to act as the Philippine government liaison to Ali, recalled an anecdote around the time of the Thriller in Manila, in which he and Ali had dinner with three female British models in Manila. ""There was a dinner hosted by Nene Araneta, the owner of the Coliseum, and there Ali met three beautiful models from England. ""And they invited him to come over to his room after the dinner."" What happened when 3 gorgeous models invited Muhammad Ali to their hotel room? @ronnathanielsz has this gem:https://t.co/6alZ2a6Vly - Julia Macfarlane (@juliamacfarlane) June 4, 2016 Ali, told Nathanielsz to come to his suite later on so the two could go visit the women. And they did. ""[In the womens' room] He asked for orange juice, sat down on the sofa and he preached about Islam until three o'clock in the morning. ""And then when we got out of the room, and went to his suite, he said 'I fooled them, didn't I?'"" This particular story is only further proof that Muhammad Ali was, at least in my opinion, the greatest wit in sporting history.

An innovative new website Instant Checkmate is now revealing the full ""scoop"" on millions of Americans. Instant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, and arrest records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Members of the site can literally begin searching within seconds, and are able to check as many records as they like (think: friends, family, neighbors, etc. etc.). Previously, if you wanted to research someone’s arrest records, you might have had to actually go in to a county court office—in the appropriate county—and formally request information on an individual. This process may have taken days or weeks, or the information might not have been available at all. With websites like Instant Checkmate , however, a background check takes just a few clicks of the mouse, and no more than a minute or two. While preparing this article I decided to run a quick search on myself to give the service a real-world test.

One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses—it’s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports. In addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of ""local sex offenders"" for whatever region you’ve searched—along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot.

1570,"Natalie Portman thinks feminism is about more than women being ""kick-ass."" She wishes we would just let our on-screen -- and off-screen -- men and women simply be human. She spoke with actor Tom Hiddleston on the subject in an interview for Elle UK's November issue: I want every version of a woman and a man to be possible. I want women and men to be able to be full-time parents or full-time working people or any combination of the two. I want both to be able to do whatever they want sexually without being called names. I want them to be allowed to be weak and strong and happy and sad -- human, basically. The fallacy in Hollywood is that if you’re making a ""feminist"" story, the woman kicks ass and wins. That’s not feminist, that’s macho. A movie about a weak, vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with. We are 100 percent with Portman on this one. Of course there should be more nuanced and complex women being portrayed in film and on television. And Portman's thoughts seem to echo Sophia McDougall's argument against the label ""strong female character"" in the New Statesman. ""No one ever asks if a male character is 'strong.' Nor if he’s 'feisty,' or 'kick-ass' come to that,"" she writes. No one asks those questions of male characters because there are so many more interesting things to be. ""We need get away from the idea that sexism in fiction can be tackled by reliance on depiction of a single personality type, that you just need to write one female character per story right and you’ve done enough,"" McDougall argues. We're pretty sure that Natalie Portman would agree.","Natalie Portman thinks feminism is about more than women being ""kick-ass."""
1573,"Buckle up, America. This trip is only getting started. As we head towards this year's April 20th — a.k.a. 4/20, a national celebration of everything pot-related — the spread of recreational and medical marijuana legalization is legitimizing a substance that for decades was consumed in the shadows and slandered with banal stereotypes. We're on a journey to a new country — a place where the relationship between cannabis, citizens, business and government looks like nothing the nation has seen before. If you're traveling somewhere new, you want a guidebook written by an expert. In 2016, our expert is David Bienenstock, a ten-year veteran of High Times magazine, and our travel guide is his book How to Smoke Pot (Properly), which just came out this week. Less pedantic than the title might suggest, How to Smoke Pot (Properly) is a 266-page primer on all things ganja rather than a step-by-step manual. There are plenty of tutorials on everything from cooking to vaping, but that only scratches the surface of the territory Bienenstock explores. The book is part history lesson, part manifesto and a full introduction to an emerging world. Whether you're a weed rookie starting from scratch or a seasoned smoker who's gathered disparate strands of information about the plant over decades, How to Smoke Pot (Properly) presents everything in one place, at the right moment in time. Prohibition and period cramps A caregiver picks out a marijuana bud for a patient at a marijuana dispensary in Denver in 2012. Image: Ed Andrieski/AP Bienenstock provides context from the start. He opens with a quick history of cannabis' place in human civilization dating back to 6,000 B.C. He summarizes its spread from Asia through Europe and North America — including the story of how Queen Victoria of England used cannabis to treat menstrual pain. Then, of course, he recaps is tumultuous legal history in more recent decades. Pot prohibition is ""an insidious plot to protect the pharmaceutical industry, Big Tobacco, the booze barons and the plastic industrial complex from unwanted competition while building up a modern police state right under our noses,"" according to Bienenstock. ""And they would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for us meddlesome stoners."" That passage encapsulates the book's tone, which is fiercely pro-pot. Our author isn't just some stoner on a rant — well, he may be exactly that, but he has bonafides to back up the ranting. Bienenstock, formerly High Times' senior editor, now produces weed-themed video content for Vice and can be found writing or talking about cannabis across all media. He uses those credentials to give us plenty of insider access and serious-style coverage. One highlight is a behind-the-scenes look at the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM), the collective that was raided by the DEA in 2002 and became a pivotal player in the medical movement. Another is a simple breakdown of how cannabis is used to treat various illnesses. Yet another is a primer on how to enter the industry, replete with interview tips from the operator of America's largest dispensary, Harborside Health Center in Oakland. How to Smoke Pot (Properly) is very much a book for the recreational enthusiast, though. There's something for tokers at all levels. Science and subcultures The Tree House Collective in Portland, Oregon, advertises its wares. Image: Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa USA Bienenstock breaks down the science, such as the basic difference between sativa and indica strains. But he goes deeper, explaining the other terpenes and chemical compounds that give different marijuana strains their own effects, smells and appearances. Along the way, he dispenses plenty of practical advice. (Just a few examples: why you should never drive stoned; how to roll a joint in the wind; why it's never wise to buy a pre-rolled joint, even from a legitimate dispensary.) Bienenstock's book shines most, though, when it functions as cultural documentation, exploring the past and future of cannabis from the vantage point of our current watershed moment. A section on smokers' ""headiquette"" runs down modern rituals, while elsewhere Bienenstock provides synopses of influential stoner subcultures over the past 200 years. Using this historical lens, and explaining how decades of prohibition have shaped the current world of marijuana, Bienenstock then casts a skeptical eye at the future and gets to the most incisive parts of his book. Tough compromises When a business — and the entire culture that surrounds it — is thrust from the shadows into the mainstream, what gets lost? What compromises are made, and who do they effect? Who gets rich, and at whose expense? We're only beginning to see the answers to these questions develop, but simply being able to ask them is remarkable in itself. ""Fifteen years ago, publicly self-identifying as a marijuana user, or even taking it up as a political cause, pretty much disqualified you from being taken seriously in the public square,"" Bienenstock writes in a chapter called ""Keep Pot Weird."" Bienenstock writes that well-intentioned colleagues — ""almost all of them closeted pot smokers"" — warned he'd never be able to get another serious journalism job after signing on at High Times. All these years later, the legalization tide is rising nationwide and Bienenstock just wrote a serious book on the subject. Pot is coming, America. Whether you like it, loathe it or bemoan its mainstream immersion, you might as well read up now.","Less pedantic than the title might suggest, How to Smoke Pot (Properly) is a 266-page primer on all things ganja rather than a step-by-step manual."

1576,"Time Magazine just reported that Reince Priebus, the Republican Party’s Chairman has given Trump a very dire ultimatum: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told Donald Trump in a phone call last week that if he doesn’t turn his flailing campaign around, the national party may shift its focus from his candidacy to down-ballot races, according to two GOP officials briefed on the exchange. Priebus who is in the unusual position of also being the Trump campaign’s sole source of cash through a joint fundraising committee which raked in $64 million last month alone. He’s also Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan’s best friend forever first campaign manager, the same member of his own party who – notwithstanding Trump’s endorsement – just won his district primary by an 84-16 margin against a heavily Trump backed opponent after the impotent presidential candidate ""withheld his endorsement"" leading to a decisive intra-party vote against hate and in favor of Ryan’s particularly heinous brand of fiscal insanity. At 6am this morning, the exclusive Time.com story went out, and it could have only leaked from one very specific person, the Chairman of the Republican National Party Reince Priebus. The timing was no accident as data scientist studies show that Trump tweets the most in the early morning hours, and he is personally an Anrdoid user, while his iPhone using campaign takes over during the daytime hours. So when Donald Trump went on CNBC early this morning to say he won’t change and, if he loses, it’s all the same to him, it wasn’t just an accidentally humble moment, but actually a capitulation. Trump told the aptly named ""Squawk Box"" program: ""I’m a truth teller. All I do is tell the truth. And if at the end of 90 days, I’ve fallen short because I’m somewhat politically correct even though I’m supposed to be the smart one and even though I’m supposed to have a lot of good ideas, it’s OK. I go back to a very good way of life."" This is a fatal response by Trump, in front of the more educated audience on a financial news network, a tacit admission that his campaign strategy of leaving all of the staffing and infrastructure to the national Republican Party and running a tiny campaign of idiotic surrogates out to every CNN broadcast for 6 months solid while slinging pure bullshit, has finally gone politically bankrupt. Twenty years after Democrats scored an early knockout in the presidential race between another Clinton and Bob Dole that left the Republican ticket so wounded, they went to the press a week before the election to complain that they’d been dumped, it has happened again, they’re cutting the top of the ticket. I know, this is like claiming that there’s dog whistles blaring, but we know that the candidate reads everything about himself, and his words mark a tacit acceptance by Trump that he will in fact finish the race. It’s also a more important – dare it be described as mature – realization from Trump that his relationship with the Republican Party is about to end after the race, because he’s not going to win. This quite probably marks the beginning of the end of the schism of the Republican Party in this year’s general election, and Trump is getting kicked out of the club.","if he doesn’t turn his flailing campaign around, the national party may shift its focus from his candidacy to down-ballot races"
1580,"Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) throws during an afternoon practice at training camp in Oxnard, Calif., on Friday, Aug. 5, 2016. (Max Faulkner/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images) Everyone used to know who America's Team was. These days, it's not as obvious. The Dallas Cowboys will never fully lose the lofty ""America's Team"" nickname, but the title has certainly not been earned in recent years. The Cowboys might make a load of money -- the franchise is the most valuable in the world, according to Forbes -- but that's where the relevance stops. Business is only half the game, at best, and in the modern media landscape, the product on the field matters more and more every year. Look at a franchise like the Golden State Warriors. Before Stephen Curry became the back-to-back MVP of the NBA, the Warriors were arguably the worst franchise in all of sports. The Chicago Blackhawks couldn't put 3,000 people in the United Center before 2008 -- now the Hawks are a cash cow that might as well have a national TV deal. Relevance comes cheap these days. Staying power is hard to maintain. Amid these truths, the Cowboys are testing fate -- they're a worse-than .500 team in recent years that is cashing in on its reputation from 20 years ago. Since 2010, the Cowboys have been 46-50, with three-straight 8-8 years from 2011 to 2014. The Cowboys haven't been to the NFC Championship Game since 1995, the season they last won the Super Bowl. The Redskins and Lions can boast longer NFC title game droughts, but that isn't saying much -- think about how many times the Bears have gone from bad to good and back in that 20-year stretch. The Cowboys have given those under the age of 25 nothing worthwhile to remember them from, outside of three above-average regular seasons, and it shows. The Cowboys are reportedly concerned about the team's lack of success and how the brand -- the most valuable brand in the NFL -- doesn't resonate with the new generation of fans. They should be concerned. The Cowboys might be the most popular team in the NFL, according to the most recent numbers from Harris , but the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers are the favorite teams of those under the age of 30. The Cowboys make up the big meaty middle -- they're the dominant team of those aged 30-64 -- but that group doesn't determine who is cool these days. Ninety-four percent of respondents under the age of 30 told Public Policy Polling before the Super Bowl that the Cowboys were not ""America's Team."" PPP also found that no survey takers from ages 18-29 listed the Cowboys as their favorite team, but 41 percent of those under-30s did say the Cowboys were their least favorite team. In all, the Cowboys were the second least-liked team in the NFL, despite the fact that they haven't posed much of a threat to anyone for the last 15-or-so years. High disapproval and an aging and diminishing support base -- it doesn't take a political scientist to figure out that if the Cowboys don't change paths soon, they're going to see a precipitous fall. (Donald Trump, who shares these polling qualities, probably thinks the Cowboys shouldn't change a thing.) So who is America's Team these days? Well, polling shows that if you're winning, you're the favorite. How else would the Carolina Panthers be the favorite team of under-30s? Given the flippant nature of fandom, the correct answer might be ""none of the above."" The social media age, the constant expansion of fantasy football, the RedZone channel, and ability to watch any game you want on any device you can imagine might make the unaffiliated the most influential NFL fans. Fans might say they like the local team, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where they care as much about their fantasy team as what the Titans are doing. Alas, even if they win big this year, it might be too late for the Cowboys to earn back the ""America's Team"" title.",Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers are the favorite teams of those under the age of 30

1583,"This weekend as many as 2,500 residents of Mosul escaped from the western half of a city that has been under the yoke of so-called Islamic State (IS) for almost three years. Aid agencies estimate that there are approximately 750,000 civilians trapped in western Mosul, unable or too frightened to leave despite the very real prospect of a prolonged, intense battle over the city between Iraqi government forces and IS fighters. The assault on western Mosul has, thus far, been largely as expected - a much better equipped and better trained Iraqi army than the one humiliated by IS in 2014, methodically pushing towards the edge of the city thanks to overwhelming fire power and the cover of coalition air strikes. For all their brutality and intolerance, IS fighters are nothing if not ingenious and in recent days they have been deploying a battle tactic almost unprecedented in modern urban warfare - the use of commercially available drones to drop bombs and grenades against civilian and military targets. Large military drones are, of course, used to devastating effect by armies all over the Middle East, often resulting in huge loss of life. But the frequency and accuracy of how the Islamic State group is utilising small, relatively unsophisticated drones in Mosul has significantly slowed the advance of government forces. The drones have also caused panic among the civilian population, including residents of eastern Mosul. That part of the city was recaptured from IS last month during the first part of a campaign to drive the Islamists from their last stronghold in Iraq. At a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil I met 55-year-old Umm Mohammed. The mother of seven, from the eastern side of Mosul, was sitting up in her bed, attached to a drip and unable to rest because of the searing pain from her right leg. It had been shattered in several places by a grenade or small bomb dropped from a drone. ""I'd just gone to the market for some shopping... The next thing I was lying on the ground and looking up. People started pointing up to the sky from where the bomb had come,"" she told me. ""Where's the security when these machines are hovering over people and killing us?"" Psychological effects The use of drones, with their relatively light payloads, will not change the course of this conflict. There are much more expensive, lethal and sophisticated weapons being deployed each day in their thousands. Yet the psychological impact of drone attacks cannot be discounted, says Emanuele Nannini from the Italian aid agency Emergency, which helps run the hospital where Umm Mohammed and several other drone victims are being treated. ""Physically they are very similar to a mortar attack but actually they are very precise,"" Mr Nannini tells me, as he supervises a rapid expansion of the hospital beds and wards in anticipation of the battle unfolding in western Mosul. ""So each of these drones is actually striking the target that was chosen. Psychologically it can be very bad for the population because they can strike at any moment and at any place."" The residents of eastern Mosul are, ironically, getting a brief respite from the drone attacks because IS militants have diverted their attention to the new front line to the south and west of the city. A colleague who returned from reporting duties at the front over the weekend told me in graphic terms that it was ""almost raining bombs"" - such was the frequency and intensity of the drone attacks on forces trying to enter the city. Again, it's important to emphasise the overwhelming military and numerical advantage that Iraqi military units have over their IS enemies. They are also getting considerable help from their American and other coalition allies. ""The fight in Mosul would be a huge challenge for any army, but this battle is only going to end with one result,"" says Lieutenant Colonel John Hawbaker, commander of the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry. American ""advisers"" and troops are a common sight on and just behind the front line and at forward command bases, assisting and advising their Iraqi counterparts. But, as Lt Col Hawbaker readily acknowledges, American soldiers - so-called ""boots on the ground"" - are seeing action where it is deemed appropriate. At the base I visited a few kilometres back from the western edge of Mosul, huge American artillery pieces fired shells at IS positions in and around the besieged city. Territorial control: 24 February 2016 The day before, the gunners told me, they'd had the busiest period yet in this conflict, lobbing hundreds of shells at distinctive targets picked out by their own spotters and much more sophisticated ""eyes in the sky"", or surveillance drones. The state of the art US weaponry will be of less use as the battle moves into the narrow, winding streets of Mosul itself. On the first day of real fighting inside the western zone, government troops reported encountering ""dozens"" of booby-trapped car bombs. Some of them were successfully defused but others exploded, killing and wounded several Iraqi soldiers. It's also thought that, in another example of drones adapted for urban warfare, IS militants are using the small aircraft to guide suicide car bombers to their targets. Amid the chaos and mayhem, Mosul's civilian residents are being exposed to unimaginable daily horrors. American and Iraqi generals say the fighting will be ""house-to-house"" in buildings where IS militants have deliberately placed themselves among the civilian population and in which they have constructed an elaborate network of tunnels to move themselves and their weapons. Outside the city, aid workers wait nervously. The UN refugee agency is building new camps, just to the south, preparing to receive as many as 250,000 internally displaced people. The real concern, as one UN aid official told me, is that most of the population won't able to escape, that they'll be trapped inside Mosul until the fighting finishes, the guns fall silent and Islamic State is defeated.",Battle for west Mosul: Bombs 'fall like rain' on front line

1591,"By Sophia Breene For many new university students, heading off to college means figuring out how to balance studies, work, a social life and living alone all at the same time. Adapting to college life is even more challenging when faced with the threat of the so-called ""Freshman 15,"" a term for the weight college freshmen supposedly gain during their first year away from home. Is the Freshman 15 real, or just a cultural myth? Let's begin with a bit of a bombshell: The Freshman 15 isn't a legitimate, scientific phrase. Seventeen Magazine introduced the term on its August 1989 cover with the all-caps subhead ""FIGHTING THE FRESHMAN 15."" Since then, the expression has gained popularity and credence throughout pop culture... but is it a real phenomenon? Recent studies suggest that while college students (both male and female) do gain weight during their first year at school, it's more to the tune of five pounds rather than fifteen. A recent Ohio State University study that included data from 7,418 young people over the course of their college years found that women and men, on average, gained around three pounds during freshman year. Less than ten percent of the freshmen gained 15 pounds (or more), and a full quarter of the students actually lost weight in their first year. However, the study also found that on average, students slowly gained weight while at college. For women, the difference between first day of school and graduation was between seven and nine pounds; for men, it was between 12 and 13 pounds. Overall, the only consistent ""cause and effect"" relationship was between boozing and weight: Students who drank ""heavily"" (quaffing six or more drinks at least four days each month) were about a pound heftier than their tee-totaling friends. Other studies reinforce the message that while young people do tend to gain weight during their college years, it doesn't happen overnight (or even over one year). In fact, it might not have to do with attending a university in the first place -- the Ohio State University study found that students were (on average) just a half-pound heavier than their non-collegiate peers. According to the researchers, this may be because many 17 or 18 -year-olds are simply not at their full adult size (both in height and weight) before heading off to college. So while some weight gain might be the result of late-night nachos and keg stands, a significant part of the ""Freshman 15"" can be attributed to plain old-fashioned growth. Why It Matters Type ""Freshman 15"" into any search engine, and a plethora of well-meaning advice articles will pop up. Common tips include eating well-balanced meals (and avoiding the all-you-can-eat dessert buffet table) in the cafeteria, getting plenty of exercise and sleep, and keeping alcohol consumption (and the late-night munchies that often go along with it) under control. But are these warnings and handy tips even helpful? The hype and anxiety related to weight and eating habits at college can sometimes have a negative effect, making otherwise healthy young adults obsess over food and exercise. And the fear of weight gain and body dissatisfaction are potential triggers for eating disorders, especially among women. While it's important to teach young people how to take care of themselves in a healthy way, scary magazine articles that tout the inevitability of first-year weight gain don't help anyone. The Takeaway Although the Freshman 15 is a myth (for most), college students are still prone to gain a few pounds en route to their diplomas. Instead of fostering fear of weight gain, perhaps universities should rethink how they approach health and nutrition. Since many young people live independently for the first time when they go off to college, those four years can be an ideal time for individuals to explore which eating and exercise habits make them feel healthiest and happiest. By teaching students how to develop balanced habits for life, colleges and universities can equip young adults with the knowledge to live healthfully in school and beyond.","women and men, on average, gained around three pounds during freshman year"
1593,"Late spring and early summer are beloved for a plethora of reasons, one of the best being the appearance of the soft-shell crab. If you’ve had the pleasure of eating one, you know that they hold all the flavor of your everyday crab without any of the hassle of prying meat from its sharp, thick shell -- basically, it's seafood in its most perfect state. From Japanese restaurants to road-side seafood stops, these leggy crabs are worth seeking out. But before you start feasting, you might want to know WTF they are, anyway. Soft-shell crabs are not a separate species of crab. They’re regular crabs -- in the U.S. they’re most typically blue crabs -- that have gotten too big for their shells. In order to keep on growing, they shed their shell and make new, bigger ones. In other words, they molt, and it is this molting process that makes soft-shell crabs such a treat. In order to shed its shell, the crab forms an inner soft shell underneath, swells its body with water to break its current shell, slowly crawls out -- this can take 10 minutes alone -- and then begins the process of forming a new shell. It takes a couple of days for a new shell to fully harden. That's when we want to catch them. The molting process looks a little like this. (You can watch the whole 8-minute video here). YouTube: jackienaquin Soft-shell crabs are best eaten golden and crisp. If you try to boil them as you would a normal crab, they would just fall apart. It’s a good idea to get your fill when you can because although the season is plentiful, it's also short.","Soft-shell crabs are not a separate species of crab.

1600,"We may take it for granted, but texting really is one of the most significant technological advancements of the past several years. The ability to send short, instant messages helps us build and maintain strong relationships, even when we’re too busy to call. When we aren’t able to get in touch with those people we text the most, it’s jarring. Why aren’t they available to us right now? we’ll wonder. But for one mother, it was an unexpected message that shook her to her core... Carole Adler couldn’t have been closer to her son, Taylor Thyfault. The young man would frequently text his mother about all sorts of things to keep up with her. They were always in touch. Just about any mother would speak highly of her children, but there was something extra special about the way that Carole talked about Taylor. Their relationship was undoubtedly a close one, ever since day one. Of course, the feeling was mutual for Taylor, who wasn’t shy about telling his mother about all sorts of important things. He’d often tell her about all of his life’s goals, many of which he was lucky and hard-working enough to achieve. For example, Taylor told his mother about a list of various things that he wanted to accomplish in his life, including wrestling an alligator, coaching a lacrosse team, owning an English bulldog he would name Diesel, and never getting arrested. Taylor seemed determined to achieve everything on his list. He joined the U.S. Army and he really took the motto of being ""the best that [he] could be"" to heart—despite his mother’s concerns about the dangers of his profession. Another one of Taylor’s goals was to pursue a career, but he didn’t want just any old job. He became a state trooper, which allowed him to create plenty of opportunities to achieve another one of his goals: to save a life. As proud and supportive as Carole was of her son, she also couldn’t help but be concerned about the dangers of his job. One day, at the scene of an accident, Taylor decided to text her updates on the situation... It was May 23, 2015, and Taylor’s cadet training was almost complete. Very soon, he would be a fully fledged police officer, just like he had always dreamed. For the time being, though, he still had a job to do on this ride-along. Carole’s memory of that fateful morning remained crystal clear. ""Taylor texted me that day at 7:30 and said ‘I’m at an accident at Highway One and Highway 66,'"" she recalled, sadly. Taylor, along with another trooper, were warned of a potentially dangerous high-speed chase that was heading in their direction. So they both set up stop sticks to try to slow down the oncoming encounter. That’s when tragedy struck. When the car in question came rushing toward the two men, the driver didn’t stop — and he hit both of them. The other trooper was critically injured, while Taylor was killed instantly. Yet the two men in uniform weren’t alone. There was also a tow truck driver at the scene of the original accident who came out almost completely unscathed — and it was all because the heroic Taylor had shouted at him to get out of the way before he lost his own life. This was undeniably a tragedy, but there was at least one bittersweet aspect of the story. In his final moments, Taylor had managed to complete one last goal from the list that was so important to him: he saved a life. Taylor had died a hero. He’d accomplished a great deal in his short life, but there were still so many things that he would never have the opportunity to experience. However, his legacy didn’t exactly end there... Taylor didn’t tell anybody about the list but his mother she was even the last person that he spoke to before he died. Clearly, they had a special bond. As she mourned the loss of her son, Carole continued to text him, knowing he couldn’t answer. Carole thought that nobody else would know about her secret messages to her deceased son, but there was, in fact, a living person who was seeing every text that she sent. He happened to be another police officer... After Taylor’s untimely death, Sergeant Kell Hulsey needed a phone with a new number. Incidentally, he received the young man’s old number, and he formed an unexpected connection with Carole. Initially, the police sergeant ignored Carole’s mysterious messages, but once he figured out what was going on, he couldn’t let it go any longer. What happened next was an extraordinary moment... ""I’m with the Greeley Police Department, and I don’t think your texts are going where you think they are,"" Sergeant Kell Hulsey sent. He then offered to switch numbers, but Carole insisted that he keep it. The grieving mother said that it eased her sorrow knowing the line was going to someone who had the job her son dreamed of one day doing. ""I am honored that a police officer of your credentials has his number,"" she told him. Carole still texts with Husley, who, after hearing about Taylor, has found a renewed passion for his career and is grateful to know that he has someone else looking out for him. Adler still texts him, reminding him to be safe. ""It’s good for me to remember all the wonderful things he was looking forward to,"" Husley says. ""It’s like I always have a little angel in my pocket now."" Though Taylor’s actions ultimately led to a life being saved, it also proves how a person’s passion can sometimes put them in harm’s way. Connor Cummings, a second-year college student from Rockaway, New Jersey knew this all too well... Connor loved getting involved with anything that allowed him to flex his creative muscles, and he had a strong passion for photography. Friends said it was rare to catch him without a camera in his hand. In fact, he’d recently landed a job taking photos at his school in Massachusetts — a dream job for someone like Connor. Naturally, he saw it as a huge stepping stone to a photography career once he graduated college. Over Christmas break in 2015, his parents bought him a brand-new Canon camera to congratulate him on landing the job. They wanted him to start with his best foot forward, and a sleek new camera was the first step towards success. On New Year’s Eve, Connor ventured into New York City to get some photographs of the cityscape at night. The city had amazing views, and the young photographer wanted to capture its beauty through his new lens. Along with his friend, 18-year-old Dimitri Olivares, who also had a knack for photography, Connor headed into the city. The two young men were excited to return with a roll full of great pictures to show their friends and family. The boys hopped a subway into Midtown, and as soon as they got off, they headed to a building near Times Square to start shooting. They could already sense some spectacular images were about to materialize. Soon enough, their search for some even better views led the boys to the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street. They knew hotels often boasted rooftop balconies, and they were excited to find awesome angles of the Big Apple. Far from being concerned about security, they walked right into the hotel and stepped into the elevator, taking it to the top floor, which was 52 stories up. Once there, they climbed a few flights of stairs to the roof — and found the door unlocked. The roof, however, wasn’t as high as the intrepid shutterbugs wanted to get. So when they spotted some scaffolding, they decided it was the perfect way to find the right vantage point without the risk of getting caught by hotel security. Cameras held tightly in their grasp, the two boys carefully climbed the scaffolding. Eventually, Connor asked Dimitri to pose for a picture mid-climb, and that’s when tragedy struck... As Connor was positioning himself to take the picture, he stepped back through a hole in the scaffolding. The hole hung above a nine-story drop—and Connor plummeted to his death. Dimitri was horrified, and he fled the scene without telling anyone what just happened.","""I’m with the Greeley Police Department, and I don’t think your texts are going where you think they are,"""
1601,"Picture the finest possible candidates for elected office. Fix those superlative politicians in your mind. How would you describe them? What words would you use? Are they are ""tough"" and ""ambitious""? Are they ""decisive"" and ""determined"" and ""unwavering""? Odds are, we agree: They are—absolutely. These are the prerequisites for good leadership. These are the makings of the best politicians. Now ask yourself this: Are the representatives that those terms suggest men or women? ""The way the press uses language is an issue for women,"" explains Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. ""When the media talks about men and calls them 'strong and assertive,' that shows strength and that's important. But when women are described in those same words, that can be very negative and very detrimental to them."" As Hillary Clinton formalized her entrance into this latest presidential contest earlier this month, Walsh is more conscious of that trend than ever. Most Popular A report that the Barbara Lee Foundation released last year concludes that women in politics—even women as powerful as Hillary Clinton—face ""a double bind."" Both male and female politicians must prove that they are qualified to hold the positions they seek. But women who want to win races need to demonstrate a more elusive feature: They have to be deemed ""likeable"" as well. ""That factor becomes a challenge in the kind of coverage that women get,"" Walsh says, remembering how Clinton was represented the media during her last presidential race—her depiction punctuated with jokes about ""nutcrackers and pantsuits."" ""If women are not portrayed as the kind of people that voters like or if the press uses certain adjectives to describe them, it calls into question whether or not they have the credentials they need to succeed,"" Walsh continues. ""This is the tension that Hillary Clinton has to deal with every day—in 2008 and, again, in 2016. This is the struggle. How do you run as a woman to be the commander in chief of the most powerful country in the world?"" Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners confirms the dramatic effect that media coverage can have on the public perception of women in politics. As part of the Name It, Change It project, Lake found that an emphasis on the physical appearance of a female candidate in the press diminished the likelihood that she could be elected and that even minor sexism in the media could undermine her chances at the polls. ""What was interesting to me was that mild sexism had just as much—or, in some cases, more—of an impact than rampant sexism,"" Lake says. ""Calling a candidate an 'ice queen' or a 'mean girl' is just as damaging as using really overt sexist language. And there's no question that all this deters women from getting into politics. If someone who is a treasurer and a lieutenant governor of a state can be called an ""ice queen,"" if someone is a sitting U.S. senator can be called ""a mean girl,"" then, gosh, women think, 'Why am I going to try this? I'm not.'"" Lake and Walsh agree that there is significant room for improvement—especially on the eve of such an historic election. The key, the say, is to encourage women to take control of a media narrative that discriminates against them. ""Notice how gender gets used,"" Walsh counsels. ""Notice how gender might change campaigns and campaign messages."" To make it easier for voters to be so vigilant, the Center for American Women and Politics recently launched Presidential Gender Watch—a nonpartisan project that aims to ""track, analyze, and illuminate gender dynamics"" in the election. ""You can't read everything under the sun,"" Walsh acknowledges. ""But you can be on the lookout. You can be critical."" According to Lake, the ""really depressing thing"" is that both male and female reporters resort to gendered language and biased exposure. Given that, she contends that no combination of sources can promise objective news. But rather than accept the thread of sexism that has woven its way through so much of modern media, Lake urges consumers to see the pervasiveness as an opportunity. ""As women, we all have a role in calling this out,"" Lake maintains. ""But young women, in particular, can make this difference. On social media and on all these platforms, they can call it out and pass it on. They can make this a movement and demand change. They can be the watchdogs here. All they have to do is tweet about it."" ""It has been so tough for women in these races,"" Walsh concedes. ""It's too early to say what is going to happen this time. Given where we are right now, I'm in a wait-and-see mode."" Us too.","They have to be deemed ""likeable"""
1603,"Funerals are beginning for the victims of this week’s tragic mass terrorist shooting in Orlando, and family members from across the country have begun their sad journeys to say goodbye. In the midst of their great grief, the support of their communities and even strangers are bringing much comfort to these bereft relatives of lost loved ones. Perhaps the most shining example thus far, one that truly restored faith in humanity, is the treatment of victim Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo’s grandmother on her JetBlue flight to Orlando. JetBlue employee Kelly Davis Karas detailed the extraordinary event in a Facebook post, saying: ""Today my dear friend Melinda and I had the sad privilege of attending to his grandmother on our flight as she made her journey to Orlando to join her family during this unspeakable time. Knowing she was making this hard journey alone, JetBlue employees made sure to be at her side every step of the way. Melinda stood quietly by her wheelchair while we waited until it was time to board. Kellie, the gate agent, boarded with her and helped get her settled. Melinda and I gave her a blanket, a pillow, a box of tissues and water so she could be as comfortable as possible. She was understandably distraught, but met us with kindness and gentleness. And gratitude. But here’s where our flight got truly inspiring. I had the idea to pass around a piece of paper to everyone on board and invite them to sign it for this grieving grandmother. I talked it over with Melinda and she started the process from the back of the plane. As we took beverage orders, we whispered a heads up about the plan as we went. Halfway through, Melinda called me, ""Kel, I think you should start another paper from the front. Folks are writing PARAGRAPHS."" So I did. Then we started one in the middle. Lastly, running out of time on our hour and fifteen minute flight, we handed out pieces of paper to everyone still waiting. When we gathered them together to present them to her, we didn’t have just a sheet of paper covered in names, which is what I had envisioned. Instead, we had page after page after page after page of long messages offering condolences, peace, love and support. There were even a couple of cash donations, and more than a few tears. When we landed, I made an announcement that the company had emailed to us earlier in the morning to use as an optional addition to our normal landing announcement, which states ""JetBlue stands with Orlando."" Then with her permission and at the request of a couple of passengers, we offered a moment of silence in Omar’s memory. As we deplaned, EVERY SINGLE PERSON STOPPED TO OFFER HER THEIR CONDOLENCES. Some just said they were sorry, some touched her hand, some hugged her, some cried with her. But every single person stopped to speak to her, and not a single person was impatient at the slower deplaning process. I am moved to tears yet again as I struggle to put our experience into words. In spite of a few hateful, broken human beings in this world who can all too easily legally get their hands on mass assault weapons – people ARE kind. People DO care. And through our customers’ humanity today, and through the generosity of this wonderful company I am so grateful to work for, I am hopeful that someday soon we can rally together to make the world a safer place for all. I will never forget today. ‪#‎Orlandoproud‬""",I had the idea to pass around a piece of paper to everyone on board and invite them to sign it for this grieving grandmother.
1604,"On June 16, police were called to an unlikely scene: an end-of-the-year class party at the William P. Tatem Elementary School in Collingswood. A third grader had made a comment about the brownies being served to the class. After another student exclaimed that the remark was ""racist,"" the school called the Collingswood Police Department, according to the mother of the boy who made the comment. The police officer spoke to the student, who is 9, said the boy's mother, Stacy dos Santos, and local authorities. Dos Santos said that the school overreacted and that her son made a comment about snacks, not skin color. ""He said they were talking about brownies. . . . Who exactly did he offend?"" dos Santos said. The boy's father was contacted by Collingswood police later in the day. Police said the incident had been referred to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. The student stayed home for his last day of third grade. Dos Santos said that her son was ""traumatized,"" and that she hopes to send him to a different Collingswood public school in the fall. And she wants an apology. She said she graduated from Collingswood High School and has two other children, a 21-year-old who also went through Collingswood schools, and a 3-year-old. Her husband, the third grader's father, is Brazilian, dos Santos said. ""I'm not comfortable with the administration [at Tatem]. I don't trust them and neither does my child,"" she said. ""He was intimidated, obviously. There was a police officer with a gun in the holster talking to my son, saying, 'Tell me what you said.' He didn't have anybody on his side."" The incident, which has sparked outrage among some parents, was one of several in the last month when Collingswood police have been called to look into school incidents that parents think hardly merit criminal investigation. Superintendent Scott Oswald estimated that on some occasions over the last month, officers may have been called to as many as five incidents per day in the district of 1,875 students. This has created concern among parents in the 14,000-resident borough, who have phoned their elected officials, met with Mayor James Maley, blasted social-media message boards, and even launched a petition calling on the Camden County Prosecutor's Office to ""stop mandated criminal investigation of elementary school students."" The increased police involvement follows a May 25 meeting among the Collingswood Police Department, school officials, and representatives from the Camden County Prosecutor's Office, where school officials and police both said they were told to report to police any incidents that could be considered criminal, including what Police Chief Kevin Carey called anything ""as minor as a simple name-calling incident that the school would typically handle internally."" The police and schools were also advised that they should report ""just about every incident"" to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency, Carey said. Previously, the school district, following the state's Memorandum of Agreement Between Education and Law Enforcement Officials, had only reported incidents it deemed serious, like those involving weapons, drugs, or sexual misconduct. Both Carey and School Board President David Routzahn described the protocol set forth after that May meeting as a significant change in procedure. ""It was a pretty clear directive that we questioned vehemently,"" Oswald said. But a month after the meeting, and after police investigations that parents consider fruitless had begun to gain attention, Maley wrote in a public letter that the May 25 meeting was intended to ""reinforce the applicability"" of the MOA, ""not to expand its terms."" Prosecutor Mary Eva Colalillo, in an accompanying statement, said she hoped Maley's message ""clarifies"" the responsibilities of school officials. Maley said in an interview Tuesday that there had been a ""misunderstanding"" during the May 25 meeting. But Oswald said the Prosecutor's Office was shying away from its own instructions. ""At some point, it seems, they've realized that the intent of the MOA that they're leaning heavily upon is not what they directed us to do,"" Oswald said. ""It went way above what that MOA says."" Another point of contention between the Prosecutor's Office and school officials is what prompted Maley's meeting in the first place. In a public letter issued to parents Monday, Routzahn said he was ""not aware of any single event"" in the district that might have prompted the Prosecutor's Office to ask for a higher reporting standard. But Maley said the Prosecutor's Office had been concerned about a ""delay"" in reporting an incident at Collingswood High School this spring.

""I welcome discussion on that as well,"" he said. Several parents said they consider the recent police involvement not only ridiculous but harmful.

And Pam Gessert, a Collingswood resident who works as a school counselor in Burlington County, said that because teachers have the best relationships with students, they are most qualified to determine what happened in a particular incident.

1605,"Donald Trump is misleading people by citing unscientific, unrepresentative Internet polls that portray him as the ""winner"" of Monday's debate. ""We won every poll. Virtually every poll,"" he told supporters Tuesday afternoon, challenging the media consensus that Hillary Clinton prevailed. Trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them ""such a great honor."" But the things Trump called ""debate polls"" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNNMoney that the surveys are like ""junk food."" Meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. The goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. That's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. People choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. The only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some Trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. But political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. Early Tuesday morning, former Obama strategist David Plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by Trump are simply ""bogus."" Trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was on display throughout the primary season. He frequently claimed that he ""won"" debates based on self-selecting polls conducted by web sites like The Drudge Report. Several respected news outlets -- Time, CNBC and Fortune to name three -- posted the surveys after Monday's debate, lending the unreliable practice an air of credibility. While sites like Time may value giving visitors a way to opine about the debate, Trump's embrace of the results ends up embarrassing both himself and the news outlet involved. ""These snap polls are just a way to feed the beast until the next batch of appropriately-conducted polls can come out to tell us if voters actually moved. It's like eating a junk food snack between meals,"" Anderson said. Trump's tweet also cited surveys from obscure web sites like ""PolitOpinion."" In one case on Tuesday, Trump even cited a poll that did not exist. ""I won CBS,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends."" CBS correspondent Major Garrett took to Twitter to clarify: ""We did not conduct a post-debate poll."" CBS did conduct a focus group of undecided voters, and Clinton came out ahead. Trump said on Fox that the survey results ""mean a lot"" to him, noting that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast on some of the web sites. That's true, but since people can vote multiple times -- and, with the right software, perhaps even more than that -- it isn't necessarily meaningful. Nevertheless, the surveys allow Trump and his aides to rail against media elite reactions to the debate and argue that voters are outsmarting pundits. And that's exactly what the campaign did on Tuesday. ""Trump won"" was the campaign's dominant social media message, citing the surveys as proof. Some political reporters called out the tactic. ‏""Trump's aggressive promotion of online (easily manipulated, non-scientific) polls saying he 'won' is a calculated effort to create a reality,"" Emily Flitter, who covers the Trump campaign for Reuters, tweeted. But the co-hosts of ""Fox & Friends,"" who are reliable cheerleaders for Trump, went along with Trump's talking point. Other Fox hosts also picked up on it, even though the network has its own well-regarded polling unit. Fox morning news anchor Martha MacCallum said debate watchers are ""leaning toward Donald Trump, and by pretty large margins in most of these viewer polls."" She called CNN's poll the ""outlier,"" showing Clinton as the clear winner among debate watchers. In fact, CNN/ORC's poll was one of the few polls conducted by professional researchers immediately following the debate. ""Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Trump had the better night,"" CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote, based on the findings of interviews with 521 registered voters. ""Although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as Democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed Clinton the winner."" Conflating CNN's scientific poll with unscientific surveys, as both Trump and MacCallum did, is highly misleading. Some web sites, hungry for traffic, glommed on to the Trump-invented controversy. ""Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN's overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey,"" The Daily Mail web site said. Unhappy with the results of CNN's scientific poll, Trump criticized the network on Twitter, on Fox and at a campaign event. ""We won virtually every poll. Except for CNN. And nobody watches CNN,"" he said. About 10 million people watched the debate on CNN on Monday night. Overall, more than 80 million people tuned in on television, and millions more live-streamed the debate on the Internet.",We won virtually every poll. Except for CNN. And nobody watches CNN

Roasted with some proteins, stir-fried in some vegetables, blended into a creamy pasta sauce.... the list goes on and on. Personally, I absolutely love the flavour and aroma of garlic so when a recipe calls for two cloves of garlic, I’ll somehow justify to myself that I really should be putting in five or six. And the best part is that I don’t feel too guilty about it because garlic is healthy! Garlic can be used to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller’s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you’re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you’ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!). If you can consume it this way on a regular basis, it can go a long way in boosting your immune system!",great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins

1617,"After dragging its heels, deflecting blame and receiving threats of huge fines, Facebook has suddenly found a comprehensive solution for tackling fake news. The new protocol, which will be rolled out in Germany first, is simple; new tools for users will allow them to flag links as potential fake news. This will prompt an independent fact-checking organisation, Correctiv, to verify the article's veracity. If they deem to it to be fake news, then the link is given a 'disputed' badge and shunted down to the bottom of your newsfeed. It's a clever, pragmatic solution that will have an immediate impact on fake news, which is important given that Germany has an election coming up. But I can see potential flashpoints with Facebook's new tools that might blunt their effectiveness. Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg The disputed badge will become a badge of honour The Facebook pages that spread fake news and the people that share it revel in being anti-establishment. If their posts are routinely flagged with 'disputed' then they'll wear that as a badge of honour. They'll complain that the establishment, backed by the boogeyman mainstream media, is trying to silence dissenters and whoever supports their cause. That the establishment is trying to shut down debate and hide the truth, which plays perfectly into the fake news agenda. The communities these organisations create are a large part of why they're so successful. It's not just that some people are duped by fake news, it's also that they want to believe it. It's confirmation bias. Of course, not everyone is an ideological zealot. Many people are simply fooled into sharing an article they thought was true and will accept that it's not. But many willingly play their role in the creation and spread of fake news. People will flag real news as fake news Within the above example, retaliation is a likely possibility. Armies of believers who feel slighted by Facebook's 'intrusion' will likely seek revenge by flagging mainstream media articles as fake news. There's also the people who steadfastly believe that established media outlets are little more than puppets of the government. That's not entirely without merit (which is a debate for another day), but expect people with differing opinions to CNN to flag their content as fake. I do wonder how well equipped the fact-checkers are to handle a deluge of requests,too. They could be buried in requests they can't keep up with, or, alternatively, a new independent fact-checking industry could be born. Check out how I bought Reddit's front page with fake news It will become clear that making these posts less visible is the only real solution I hope that making it clear to users that the content they're reading is fake will put a dent in the fake news problem. But, as I've laid out above, that could very well not be the case. Part of the German Facebook experiment includes making stories marked as 'disputed' appear lower in newsfeeds. I suspect this will have the greatest impact on tackling fake news. If it can't be seen, then it can't spread and the organisations can't make money. This, of course, brings with it other headaches. Namely, Facebook having the power to determine what isn't 'acceptable' news, which is not a road anyone wants to go down. However, having the backing of an independent, non-profit, investigative journalism fact-checking group does alleviate those concerns. The time I've spent looking into fake news and the people that believe/share it tells me that it's an entirely unpredictable beast that's hard to control. Facebook will have to adapt its tools quickly to make sure its solution remains relevant. On a wider note, to truly tackle fake news, society needs to trust the media again and people need to  apply critical thinking to every bit of information they receive. The latter two points aren't solved overnight, but at least we've finally started that journey.",The Facebook pages that spread fake news and the people that share it revel in being anti-establishment.

""It could be a very different election than anyone expects."" watch video watch video here The major difference Gingrich sees playing out this year is the ubiquitous nature of social media, which makes it possible for a candidate with the kind of momentum Trump has exhibited to motivate supporters across the political spectrum, even in deep blue states like California and New York.

Is there anyone watching the 2016 contest so far – Trump supporter or opponent – who doubts that the man will go big? Answering questions from Facebook viewers, Gingrich expounded on the theme. The unexpectedly strong challenge Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has mounted to Hillary Clinton’s nomination for the Democrats only underscores the former secretary of state’s vulnerability in a general election, he said. If Clinton does eventually secure the nomination — which appears to be a sure bet at this point — the young people who turned out for Sanders in state after state could well find their way into the Trump camp come Election Day, Gingrich said. Trump has said the same thing as Trump has said the same thing as TPNN reported Clinton’s ongoing email scandal, her deep and embarrassing (for a Democrat) ties to the financial world, and the continuing cloud that hangs over the global money laundering operation known as the Clinton Foundation will make it impossible for her to count on former Sanders’ supporters, Gingrich pointed out.

1621,"Donald Trump's children say they're not registered to vote in New York's April 19 primary. How did that happen? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) When Donald Trump went on ""Fox and Friends"" on Monday morning, he shared some strange news: Two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, won't be able to vote for him in New York's April 19 Republican primary. Wait, really? How did that happen? In the most basic terms, they missed the registration deadline. But while the three Trumps have spent the week saying they ""didn't register to vote"" in time, it's actually a little bit more complicated than that. Ivanka has said several times that she's a registered independent, because she prefers to vote for individual candidates over broader party platforms. Her brother Eric has also indicated he's registered as an independent. The problem for them is that New York has very restrictive laws around switching one's party affiliation. While new voters were permitted to register up until March 25 – less than a month before the primary – the deadline for switching party affiliations was way back on October 9 of last year. That still doesn't mean it would have been tough to make the switch to the party that, you know, their dad will probably represent as presidential nominee. As an experiment, I went through the whole process at my desk this morning. It involved printing out a PDF document (which New Yorkers can pick up from county election board offices or some state agencies), then filling it out by hand. It took two minutes, to the second (full disclosure – I didn't fill it out with my real information. My name isn't ""John Post,"" and my Social Security number certainly doesn't end in ""1-2-3-4."") Yes, New York has some weird deadlines for switching party affiliation. And yes, any one of us could have made the mistake that Eric and Ivanka Trump did. But most of us aren't the children of major party candidates for president. As The Fix's Philip Bump wrote on Monday, the Trump campaign has an organization problem, from the delegate battle right on down. If his own kids – who, by their own admission, have participated quite actively in this campaign – can't get voter registration right, it could be a sign that the rest of the Trump campaign is seriously lacking in organization, too.",Donald Trump's children say they're not registered to vote in New York's April 19 primary.

According to new research from the University of Southern California, up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts are in fact bots rather than people. The research could be troubling news for Twitter, which has struggled to grow its user base in the face of growing competition from Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others. Researchers at USC used more than one thousand features to identify bot accounts on Twitter, in categories including friends, tweet content and sentiment, and time between tweets. Using that framework, researchers wrote that ""our estimates suggest that between 9 percent and 15 percent of active Twitter accounts are bots."" Since Twitter currently has 319 million monthly active users, that translates to nearly 48 million bot accounts, using USC's high-end estimate. The report goes on to say that complex bots could have shown up as humans in their model, ""making even the 15 percent figure a conservative estimate."" At 15 percent, the evaluation is far greater than Twitter's own estimates. In a filing with the SEC last month, Twitter said that up to 8.5 percent of all active accounts contacted Twitter's servers ""...without any discernable additional user-initiated action."" Since that equates to roughly 20 million more bot accounts than Twitter's own assessment, that could be an issue in light of analyst concerns about user growth.

1630,"This is it for Donald Trump. The final presidential debate , which began Wednesday night in Las Vegas, is the last big set piece of the 2016 election, and perhaps the last chance for the Republican nominee to muscle his way back into an increasingly lopsided race . It will be an uphill battle. Trump's poor campaign performances, and a rash of recent allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward women in the past, have sent the billionaire businessman plummeting in the polls. With three weeks until Election Day, he now trails by an average of seven percentage points in national surveys. The battleground map looks little better. Most Republican and Democratic strategists alike now believe that Hillary Clinton is coasting toward victory. Sensing a decisive advantage, Clinton advisers are making a play to run up the score, contesting traditionally Republican states like Arizona and funneling resources into Senate contests in Indiana and Missouri. Trump has responded to his slump in the polls by lobbing a fusillade of attacks against American democracy itself. For more than a week now, the centerpiece of his stump speeches has been the claim that the race is being ""rigged"" by a vast conspiracy that includes the Clintons, global elites and their minions in the media. Trump has charged Republican leaders of disloyalty and attempted to sow doubts about the integrity of election results. It's a strategy designed to energize his core right-wing supporters. And while some advisers believe the GOP nominee stands to benefit from depressed turnout, all this ugliness is doing little to persuade swing voters. Trump faces a important tactical decision: use his largest remaining audience before Nov. 8 to amplify this ""rigged election"" argument, or seize the moment to make a sober case that he is prepared to be president. There are signs that Trump may be preparing to shift gears. He announced Tuesday that he would push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress, part of what his campaign called a ""pledge to drain the swamp in Washington."" And he released a new 30-second ad, titled ""Change,"" that casts Clinton as a D.C. institution beholden to special interests. These are some of the themes that helped Trump rampage through the Republican primaries as a conquering outsider. Clinton has different challenges. Since the last debate in St. Louis on Oct. 9, her campaign has been forced to weather the steady drip of new internal emails, hacked from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta and released by Wikileaks. The emails haven't contained a smoking gun that validates Trump's charge that she is ""corrupt."" But they have embarrassed the campaign by offering a peek at the political sausage-making process—internal debates over policy, obsessively scripted messaging, excerpts of private speeches that shade her public positions—which some voters consider unseemly. The job of putting Clinton on the spot falls not only to Trump but also moderator Chris Wallace. The Fox News host selected the six topics to be covered in the 90-minute debate: debt and entitlements; immigration; the economy; the Supreme Court; foreign hot spots; and ""fitness to be President."" In her first debate with Trump, Clinton succesfully provoked her opponent into a series of damaging stumbles. In their second, his wild haymakers put her on the defensive, even if polls showed that most voters deemed her the winner. Clinton has been trying to run out the clock, avoiding the kind of damaging mistakes that could upend her increasingly comfortable lead. The Las Vegas debate will be one of her last big hurdles in that effort. If she is to win the landmark victory her aides now have in their sights, she will be under pressure to make a positive and uplifting closing argument, not just sit back as her opponent self-immolates. As close as Clinton is to making history, it's her challenger who has stolen the spotlight. The last few weeks have been a low ebb in the annals of American democracy. Trump's claims of election-rigging have challenged some of our cherished ideals, from faith in the integrity of our voting process to the peaceful transition of power. He has an opportunity to reverse course beginning Wednesday night. Trump has certainly shown a capacity to surprise. But if the 2016 election has taught us anything, it's to prepare for more fear and loathing in Las Vegas.",last big set piece of the 2016 election
1631,"Bring it on — the brilliant smile of a Stanford swimmer with Olympic dreams, the happy privileged face of a white college kid named Brock Turner. Another picture of him smiling, please. Because this is what a campus sexual predator looks like. And that’s the truth too many people refuse to acknowledge. It’s the most difficult part of the campus rape culture destroying the lives of so many young women: acknowledging who their rapists are. Turner, 20, was convicted of sexually attacking an unconscious woman behind a dumpster at Stanford University after a fraternity party. It was a violent, brutal attack, and he was caught by two passersby, who tackled him when he tried to run away. The rape charges were dropped because it was Turner’s fingers, along with dirt and pine needles, that went inside his victim, not his sexual organ. Was that calculated on his part? Was he trying to avoid leaving his DNA in her body? The jury convicted Turner of sexual assault, which doesn’t sound quite as horrible as rape. But let’s forget the legal terms and look up the word rape in the dictionary. Merriam-Webster defines it as ""unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usually of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent."" I’m good with that as a solid definition of what he did. Then last week came the judge’s sentence. Turner faced up to 14 years in prison. Prosecutors asked for six. Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky, who also walked the knolls of the gorgeous campus in California as a student, worried that anything more than six months in the local jail would have ""a severe impact on him."" Well, yeah. That’s what jail is supposed to do. There is now an effort underway to recall Persky for that outrageously light sentence and for his let-me-help-this-fine-young-man commentary. Bring it on. Because this is what a judge who protects predators looks like, too. The judge did not talk about the severe impact the attack had on the victim, which is what his concern in the courtroom should be. The woman, who’s 23, spoke for herself, describing, with searing eloquence, what Turner had done to her. [‘You took away my worth’: A sexual assault victim’s powerful message to her Stanford attacker] Turner has yet to take responsibility for the attack. His father, Dan A. Turner, wrote an astonishing letter to the judge, arguing that his boy should receive probation and no jail time at all. ""His life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve,"" he wrote. ""That is a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life."" Let’s talk about this ""action."" Turner was caught by two bicyclists who didn’t know his swim times or his Olympic aspirations. What they saw was an intoxicated young man hip-thrusting a corpse-like woman on the ground behind a dumpster in the dark. When they yelled at him, he ran. If the sex was consensual — as Turner and his supporters insist it was — why run? A judge sentenced Brock Turner to six months in prison for sexually assaulting a woman on campus. The light sentence drew harsh criticism. His victim, who has chosen to not be named, spoke directly to him in a court statement. Here's what she said. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) One of Turner’s childhood friends, Leslie Rasmussen, wrote a letter on his behalf, attributing Turner’s conviction to ""political correctness."" [These colleges have the most reports of rape] ""I don’t think it’s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn’t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him. I am not blaming her directly for this, because that isn’t right. But where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn’t always because people are rapists."" Whoa. ""This is completely different from a woman getting kidnapped and raped as she is walking to her car in a parking lot. That is a rapist. These are not rapists. These are idiot boys and girls having too much to drink and not being aware of their surroundings and having clouded judgement."" This is the problem. The notion that rapists aren’t anything like Turner. They’re not smart and accomplished. They’re not polite and friendly. They’re not friends or sons or classmates. There has been a lot of outrage that Turner’s booking photos weren’t released with his arrest or conviction. They were released Monday. But the demand for them was misguided — part of the idea that rapists are evildoers who lurk in the shadows, in alleys and parking garages. No. [Why you are only now seeing the Stanford sex offender’s mugshots] Bring on the photos of rapists looking their best. Show us Andrew Luster, heir to the Max Factor fortune, looking suave before his 2003 rape convictions. Toothpaste smile, designer clothes. Give us DuPont heir Robert H. Richards IV in his blue blazer before he’s convicted of raping his daughter. Show us Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw in his police uniform, the way he was dressed when he raped all those women on his beat. This is what rapists look like. Now look at the smiling photo of Turner. This is what campus sexual predators look like, America. They are young men we know, and young men we trust. And when they are convicted of destroying lives, they must pay for their crimes.

Whether that was confirmation of the Sorcerer Supreme making an appearance or just director Taika Waititi having some fun is hard to say, but Benedict Cumberbatch may have cleared things up.Talking to Tom Hiddleston for a piece in Interview Magazine , here's what the Sherlock star had to say about joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As you can see in the highlighted section, it seems as if Cumberbatch has confirmed that he'll also be part of the very impressive cast of Thor: Ragnarok. I felt it was all about the part rather than everything else. I've been to Comic-Con, and it's a very nice way to give back to the fans that drive these things. It was quite scary. I felt like Pink Floyd. It's just like, ""Hello, hi,"" after the fans are all screaming. That side of it is just phenomenal, and it makes me giggle, and I don't know whether I'll get used to that. I can't wait to see how it expands the universe. I'm also part of your crew! It's an amazing cast of actors. And it's the most fun hard work you'll ever do, I think, as an actor. They really know how to treat you right. And the material is challenging, witty, and a lot of fun to do. Doctor Strange is a complex, funny, but exciting character. It's hard to say for sure if Cumberbatch is referring to Thor: Ragnarok or the MCU in general, but him talking about Doctor Strange expanding this world and then saying he's part of Hiddleston's ""crew"" could point to the former.

But when Rive finally got around to asking Musk for the discount, he was met with a pretty funny burn. ""I asked, 'Elon, hey can I have a family discount' and his answer is, 'Yeah absolutely.

1638,"Could The X-Men Show Up In Avengers: Infinity War? The Director Weighs In By Dirk Libbey Ever since Marvel struck a deal with Sony to bring Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there have been rumors that something similar could happen with the Marvel properties over at Fox. Now, Avengers: Infinity War director Joe Russo has weighed in. If there are any backroom talks about the X-Men joining the MCU he's not aware of them, although, he doesn't discount the possibility that talks could be going on that's not aware of. As far as we know, right now there isn't talk regarding the X-Men. I don't know if behind-the-scenes there were conversations or if there are conversations happening but we certainly haven't heard of any. Rumors of bringing the X-Men, as well as the Fantastic Four, the two Marvel properties who still have their rights owned by Fox, have been rumored on and off for years. There have been rumors that the two sides have even had some preliminary conversations, though nothing that implied that a deal was anywhere close to being signed. Comicbook.com asked Joe Russo about the possibility due to the fact that the new mutant related TV series, Legion, was referred to as being part of the MCU by Marvel at San Diego Comic-Con. If Legion was both related to the X-Men and the MCU, then it could potentially be some sort of bridge to bring the two together. Although, from everything we've heard, it doesn't even appear that Legion will be directly related to the X-Men films anyway. Still, because of the deal that led to Spider-Man appearing in Captain America: Civil War as well as his own upcoming film, Spider-Man: Homecoming , it's impossible to write off the entire concept of an eventual crossover. The Spider-Man brand was in a bit of turmoil following the disappointing performance of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and while the latest X-Men entry, X-Men: Apocalypse, failed to set any records, it's predecessor Deadpool did, so it's unlikely that Fox would look too closely at any deal that would require them to share revenue in any way., If Fox is looking at looking at a way to save any of their franchises, The Fantastic Four would be the more likely choice, considering the fact that its last film had real problems, and plans for a sequel appear to have been either canceled, or put on a back burner that's so far back nobody can currently see it. Still, it's also unclear what Fox is planning for the X-Men at this point anyway. While there are a number of related projects planned, including Deadpool 2, New Mutants and possibly a Gambit movie if Channing Tatum can ever find a director, there's no word on what's next for the main series or any of its characters, save the retiring Wolverine. If you were going to do something new with the characters, now would be just about the best time to do it.

1639,"Any lover of good quality sushi knows that if you’re going to enjoy toro or uni, you probably aren’t going to enjoy getting the bill. That’s the lesson that Vice contributor Chris Galletta and his friend Matt learned after eating at a New York sushi restaurant opened by a sushi chef trained by Jiro Ono, the greatest sushi master in the world. Galletta and his friend Matt had planned to watch the play ""Waiting for Godot"" starring actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Before going to watch the play, however, the two friend’s decided to try what was supposed to be a great sushi place nearby. Galletta detailed his hilarious misadventure: ""Not too far from the theater, it turned out, one of Jiro’s protégés had opened his own sushi restaurant. It was supposed to be transcendent. And so it was decided: We would fill our bellies with potent, nutrient-dense raw fish and then listen to Magneto and Professor X say some old words."" As they entered the restaurant, they were greeted by the extremely polite staff and were encouraged to sit at the bar. Jiro’s protégé, Toma, was there that night to serve the two what might be some of the best sushi in New York. They proceeded to enjoy themselves. ""We started with tuna, then fatty tuna. Then upped the stakes to toro. After each roll, the wait staff would remove our plates and bring new ones, along with a fresh set of hot towels. Chopsticks were discouraged and so were any dipping sauces. (Even soy sauce!) It was like being on Mars. Or perhaps like being in Japan."" After the tuna, they moved on to uni: ""The uni was particularly good. Uni is sea urchin, which has a disarmingly soft consistency—imagine frozen yogurt that tastes like the bottom of a sailboat. I loved the stuff."" But as the friends were enjoying themselves, the thought that this excellent food and service they were enjoying must come at a price. ""At a certain point, Matt leaned over to me and said, ‘This is gonna cost us.’ I agreed; the food was incredible and the service peerless. ""But we were prepared to pony up at least one hundred. Maybe 150."" Amazing sushi served by a sushi chef trained by Jiro himself for just $150? Only a rookie would be so naive: ""When the bill came, we took a deep breath. ‘This is going to be more expensive than the tickets,’ I joked. We opened it together, like shitty Golden Globe presenters. ""The bill read one-one-zero-zero. Eleven hundred. One-thousand one-hundred. $1,100. Dollars. ""As I mentioned, I write for a living. I didn’t have $1,100. Matt didn’t either."" As the two friends were slapped in the face with an unexpectedly large bill, they panicked trying to think about what they would do next. ""My immediate reaction was that it was a misprint. ‘No, no, we need the bill in regular dollars,’ I said, assuming the number in front of me was in yen. The place was authentic, why stop at the bill? Alas, it was eleven hundred American dollars. The wait staff, to their credit, calmly pointed out that the bill was correct and what had really happened here was that the uni was ‘fresh.'"" A piece of the fresh uni they so enjoyed had easily racked up $100 each. Galletta contemplated jumping out the window to escape the bill, but Matt had a more rational plan: ""Matt had a plan. ‘Here’s what we’ll do,’ he said. ‘I’ll put it all on my credit card. Then I’ll call the card company, and I’ll fight it. I’ll fight the purchase.'"" Then another panicked thought dawned on them: ""‘Shit. We can’t not tip them.’ And of course, he was right. The service was first-rate. What’s 20 percent on top of $1,100? More than my last week’s worth of food, easily."" A bill for $1,100 plus $220 for tip. The painful numbers continued to traumatize the friends as they headed to the theater to watch the play: ""On the walk to the theater, Matt kept mumbling ‘... gonna fight it, that’s all... fight the purchase...’ I walked to an ATM right after the theater and took that very large sum out of my savings account and paid him cash."" ""We agreed next time we’d just order a pizza and watch X-Men, because I still don’t remember a word of that fucking play."" The lesson here is that good sushi, and I mean THE BEST, served omakase by a chef trained by THE BEST sushi master in the world, at a restaurant in New York City, no less, is NEVER going to be cheap. Still, it makes for a hilarious and lifelong story to tell. Written by NextShark",A piece of the fresh uni they so enjoyed had easily racked up $100 each.

1647,"I used to have a recurring dream in which I walked through a previously unnoticed door at home, only to find myself in a secret extension, painted sparkling white and devoid of furniture. I would wake with a sensation of wistful regret. For a brief period, you see, this dream had seemed to be a possibility, after I discovered Marie Kondo’s seminal work, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying. Kondo’s philosophy appeared simple, yet irresistible: you should own nothing that does not spark joy. Falling on her book with the zeal of a convert, I promised myself that I would obey her instructions and completely purge my house in six months. At first, it was so easy. The 62 supermarket bags for life that lurked in a broken laundry basket sparked no joy (especially as I never remembered to take them with me to the shops). The holey tights that slowed me down every morning, as I tried and discarded pair after pair, followed them straight into the bin. A friend organised a timely ‘shwopping’ event in aid of a cancer charity and I handed over two bin bags of designer mistakes, including a pair of agonisingly painful Chanel heels and a made-to-measure jacket that no longer fitted. For the first time in years, I could see the back of my wardrobe. My T-shirts, now colour coordinated, were carefully folded, my sock drawer looked like a bento box, and I felt purged and pure, as if I’d been on a fast. Instead of falling on an assortment of ornaments, books, photographs, dried flowers, hairbands, dead batteries and novelty rubbers, my eye skated over clean, polished surfaces. I proselytised to my family; ‘koning’ became part of our domestic vocabulary. I shelled out on see-through shoe boxes and under-bed receptacles. Alarmed by my zeal, my husband banned me from his study. I itched to get my hands on the tottering piles of books, the heaps of papers on his desk, next to the broken light-up bar sign, the collection of toy vintage aeroplanes, the stuffed bird and every home-made birthday card he had ever received. My daughters were equally resistant: mindful of Kondo’s insistence that throwing away other people’s stuff is not good etiquette, I spent a fruitless weekend trying to persuade them to prune their menagerie of teddies. In the end, I decided to tackle the fridge; not the inside (which is frankly always a little too bare) but the exterior. I’d spent a fortune on a silver fridge, but you could barely see it beneath the novelty magnets (bought on every family trip), amusing newspaper headlines I’d cut out, photographs, shopping lists and school forms – the miscellaneous stuff Kondo lumps together as ‘komono’. I swept everything into the recycling bin and waited for that familiar little thrill at the sight of another clear surface. My response startled me. I realised to my surprise that my denuded fridge looked bland, while the room appeared shabbier than before. The eye, as Diana Vreeland famously declared, has to travel. Deprived of anything interesting to travel to, my eye was fixing on irritating details. How had I previously never noticed the mould stain behind the kitchen tap, the sagging slope of the kitchen ceiling? That creative clutter on the fridge had been camouflage for mess elsewhere: the crumbs on the counter, the tangle of phone chargers. I was reminded, suddenly, of a visit to the house of a renowned minimalist architect. Photographed for a glossy magazine, it had looked inspirationally Zen, but when I was actually invited in, I was startled by how untidy a few scattered toys had made it. The effect in my sitting room was even worse. I had cleared the mantelpiece of its jumble of photographs, candles, flowers and bowls. The room just looked a little smaller, a little darker, and, now that the heaps of cushions had been removed from the sofa, the dog’s muddy paw prints were horribly visible all over the upholstery. The phone rang. I had a brief resurgence of enthusiasm when I realised how easy it was to find, no longer buried under heaps of newspapers. It was the friend who’d organised the shwopping event: as I’d donated such a lot, she’d picked me out a particularly nice pair of shoes as a thank you. Without pausing to reflect, I leapt in the car and drove over. Admiring the green stilettos she handed me, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, my old made-to-measure jacket hanging, unloved and unwanted, on the rail. It reminded me painfully of my carefree youth, when I had had the time and money to be chic and slender. How could I bin it so casually? Furtively, I slipped it off the hanger and over my arm. Putting it back in my wardrobe gave me even more joy than I had felt discarding it in the first place. To have any hope of leading a decluttered existence, I realised I would have to get rid of my magpie instincts before trying to bin anything else. The trouble is, I have always been a collector. As a child, I loved jumble sales and buying doll’s house furniture; as a teenager, I accumulated bags of vintage clothes. Latterly, my long-suffering family were forced to accommodate my brief but intense passion for antique copper pans. Another year, I became obsessed with antique linen sheets. Then there’s a wall of vintage fashion drawings that needs constant replenishing, and who can resist art-deco coffee pots, let alone those mugs that look like Penguin Classics? Last Christmas, I asked my in-laws to give me a teapot with legs, to match the sugar basin and milk jug I’d treated myself to; the year before, I requested an antique nutcracker in the shape of a dog. Would I really feel happier if I divested myself of all this komono, and was surrounded instead by bare shelves and blank walls? I feared not. And anyway, that wouldn’t deal with the issue of my husband’s ever-growing antique butterfly collection, his fondness for odd taxidermy (last birthday, he requested a stuffed boar’s head), his 300 records (though we don’t have a record player), and the political cartoons with which he has festooned the downstairs loo? So I gave in and, with a sigh of relief, allowed myself to revel in these beloved bits of tat. Minimalism, I realised, wasn’t morally superior to the alternative, it was just another aesthetic choice. Nevertheless, I had learnt one really valuable lesson: I was under no obligation to hang on to things I didn’t like, just because I had spent money on them. With a lifted heart, I binned all the plastic storage boxes along with the library of decluttering books. They no longer sparked joy. With this new, relaxed approach in mind, I went looking for my own design philosopher. I found her in the shape of the interior decorator and writer Rita Konig. Visiting her west London apartment for an interior-design workshop, I found pictures hung to the ceiling, walls painted in rich colours, and lamps, books and quirky ornaments on every surface. In short, it was the home of my dreams: the cosiest and most appealing place one could imagine. Naturally, she too disapproves of the minimalist aesthetic. ‘People are afraid of their own stuff,’ she tells me. ‘My feeling is that you have to give in to your own taste and style, because you were born with it. So often, when they declutter, people throw away the things that make their house their own. I think it’s rather a shame, this Ikea life.’ Far from merely being clutter, one’s furniture and ornaments delineate and define space, she says. ‘If you add a console table to your hall, for instance, you turn it from a corridor into a room.’ Inspired, I returned home with permission to fill it with more stuff. I offered a home to a friend’s discarded sofa, which meant that for the first time, we could all sit in comfort, rather than battling for bottom space with the dog. I dug out a folding café table from its hiding place behind the piano and resurrected several lamps that had been retired to storage. The sitting-room just seemed to expand in response, and to invite us all to sit down and enjoy it. Who can fail to have noticed that the decluttering tide is turning? In these interesting times it seems obvious that one requires a security blanket – and other soft furnishings – to ward off the chill winds of economic and political uncertainty. Last year’s minimalism has been replaced by this season’s ‘hygge’, requiring investment in furry throws, plenty of candles and cashmere socks, while sales of printed books (to restock those empty shelves) are on the rise for the first time in years. That’s not to say that one should not declutter at all; but the goal is not, as I once believed, to end up with as little as possible. ‘Part of the joy of decluttering,’ says Konig wisely, ‘is to reclutter. It’s about giving the good stuff more space. I want to empty my bookcase so I can fill it with new things that I love – I’m looking for some brass pears.’ Perhaps that’s the meaning of my recurring dream: the joy it would spark to fill up those big, blank rooms with shiny copper pans, colourful china and butterflies...","‘Part of the joy of decluttering,’ says Konig wisely, ‘is to reclutter.

1649,"Viral Video Gets 30,000 Republicans and Democrats to Vote Libertarian Last Thursday, a site called Balanced Rebellion launched a video featuring Abraham Lincoln encouraging Americans to reject both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and to vote for Gary Johnson. The site presents a brilliant idea: it pairs up a Republican who hates both Trump and Clinton with a Democrat who hates both Clinton and Trump, so rather than voting to stop the candidate they fear more, each person will be free to vote third party. ""Look, if America is Gotham City, then Hillary is the mob and Trump is the Joker,"" the video's Lincoln declares. ""The mob is always there, it's corrupt, but at least you know what you're getting. The Joker just got here, he's creating total chaos, and you don't know what he'll do next but you know it's going to be hell."" ""America, picking between the Joker and the mob is not a real choice. It's time to vote for freaking Batman."" This kind of Internet humor pervades the video, as Lincoln jokes about getting shot (""too soon?"") and emphasizes that he himself ran third party — in 1860. Matt Kibbe, president of Alternative PAC , the organization behind Balanced Rebellion, told PJ Media on Monday that over 30,000 people have made the pledge on Balanced Rebellion to vote for Johnson, and are being matched with their counterparts from the Democrat or Republican Party. So far, more Democrats than Republicans have joined the site, but the disparity is not large — Kibbe estimated it to be around 10 percent. The president noted that the video has reached ""8.5 million views in 72 hours,"" and called it ""a phenomenon."" According to Facebook, the video has been shared nearly 212,000 times, and Kibbe said it has reached 20 million people. He predicted that this video campaign will match ""half a million people."" ""We're also geo-targeting,"" Kibbe added. ""The views and the conversions are heavily weighted in states that we think matter for Gary Johnson: Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, and New Hampshire."" His political action committee has invested $50,000 into boosting the video on social media, and Kibbe announced that they will be investing another $50,000 on Monday.

""Going back to Howard Dean using social media, Barack Obama beating Hillary Clinton, the Tea Party movement in 2010 — the two party duopoly is starting to break."" The video listed three reasons why a third party candidate can win in 2016: the power of the Internet, where 1.7 billion people are on Facebook alone; Johnson's history as a ""balanced candidate,"" a Republican governor of a Democrat state, winning votes from both sides; and because two-thirds of Americans have said they would vote for anyone besides Trump and Hillary, and Johnson is the only option on the ballot in all 50 states. The Alternative PAC president admitted that the social media campaign is most likely to reach millennials, but he did not yet possess any data about the people he has reached so far.

1657,"The LinkedIn Mistake That’s Hurting Your Career Why is your colleague earning an extra $1,000-plus a month while you’re still slaving away? It’s probably because you didn’t do this. Most people talk about how to avoid mistakes in theory. They say if you don’t do X, you won’t get Y. But how does it play out in real life? Let’s look at things from the perspective of the person who has the budget to hire. Recently, I went to hire three health writers. In my search for candidates, I thought it would be best to look in a place where health writers already existed. I picked a website called Everyday Health (Alexa rank: 2,831) as a good place to check out. The Job I looked at it like this: Everyday Health is a recognized site that covers health topics. They do research on their content. The stories are very consumer friendly. That hit requirement No. 1 for me, that they were vetted as an expert in their area. The second thing I was looking for was someone whom I could contact by email, so I could document our conversation and get a proposal from them. With that second criterion in mind, I wanted to see what writers contributed to the publication. Luckily, they place all their writers on the same page. On Everyday Health’s contributing writer page, they had 110 writers listed. Well, let’s break down how the profiles of these 110 writers. The Stats 25 of them didn’t have links to a bio or website. Nine linked to an Everyday Health page, so chances are, they were staff members and faculty. One linked to their book on Amazon. Two led to dead links. One linked to Facebook. One linked to Google+. 37 linked to their LinkedIn pages. 33 of these pages only accepted inMail. The other four had a button to connect. Nine linked to their Twitter pages. Of these Twitter pages, six linked to their websites, but only four had a website with an email address. 25 linked to their website. Of these 25 websites, 21 of them had contact information or a form to fill out. Out of all 110 writers, I could only contact 25 of them by email. The Opportunity Did you know that, according to a study by Bankrate, 63 percent of Americans couldn’t handle a $500 surprise bill? What if your washing machine broke? How about the transmission in your car? Or worse yet, if you were sent to the emergency room? An extra $500 a month in any household could go a long way, either to handle a surprise bill or to improve the quality of life. The three writers I’m in the process of hiring will be earning significantly more than that. The Problem As I mentioned, I could only reach 25 of these 110 writers. That means that out of the 110 people who could have significantly improved the quality of their lives by being showcased as experts in their field, I was only able to contact 22 percent of them. Missing the Mark So 78 percent of these talented individuals completely missed out on that opportunity. Why? I had no way to contact them. The 37 people I could have contacted on LinkedIn, which most people feel is a business network, didn’t hear a word from me. That’s because when I went to their pages, I saw their résumés and saw that these people were selling their professional services, but I only had two choices. Do I pay for LinkedIn Premium out of my own pocket just so I could send them an inMail, as I would have had to for 33 of them? Do I connect with the other four, yet lose their information among the other 7,000 LinkedIn connections I have? The problem here is that not a single one of these LinkedIn profiles had either a website or an email address listed anywhere on their site. I mean, I still had to calculate which writers matched our style and which ones fit within our budget. But 85 of these 110 individuals didn’t even get a chance to be in the running, because they haven’t invested in their professional brand. The Solution If you intend to work hard, set up your brand, and be featured as an expert, you need to see it through. The reason you are doing this is so you can get more work. Here I was, ready to hire, yet so many people missed the opportunity to be contacted. In fact, if these 37 people on LinkedIn did one thing differently and had their email addresses listed, 56 percent of these contenders could have contributed their bids as opposed to 22 percent. That increases your probability of getting hired by 34 percent! If you don’t have your email addresses listed in an easily accessible place on your LinkedIn profile, or better yet, a professionally designed website, you are going to be losing income-earning opportunities every day. That needs to change. Optimize your Web properties and become easily accessible to others who are looking to hire you for your expertise. People like me aren’t going to jump through hoops to try to give you money. We want you to be easy to access so we can start a dialogue to see if you are a good fit. Stop missing out on opportunities and start setting yourself up for success. Go out there and invest in building out your professional brand in the way it needs to be seen. Add that email address to your LinkedIn page, then get that website up and operational.",either a website or an email address listed anywhere
1659,"(CNN)This is the story of a little PO box in Northern Virginia and the conspiracy that wasn't. When the Republican presidential primary was still in full swing in March, officials from Donald Trump's campaign promoted a conspiracy theory -- one of many -- insisting there was a nefarious link between his political opponents and an anti-Trump super PAC.  It began this spring when a group called Make America Awesome, an anti-Trump group, posted a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, that criticized her for posing semi-nude in a magazine photo shoot. Trump responded by crudely lambasting the physical appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and he justified it by claiming that Cruz was behind the attack on his own wife.  As evidence, Trump's team pointed to a large donation that Carly Fiorina's super PAC received from a pro-Cruz super PAC. And Fiorina's super PAC, they noted, had the same mailing address as Make America Awesome, the group that had attacked Trump's wife. Because those groups listed the same address, they claimed it was proof that the anti-Trump forces were operating from the same source.  Trump's supporters, including his campaign's social media director, Daniel Scavino, lit up the Internet with screenshots showing the identical address: PO BOX 26141 in Alexandria, Virginia. Trump-friendly websites wrote about it as though it was evidence of a vast conspiracy against the Republican frontrunner.  CNN traced the address to a PO Box owned by Christopher Marston, an attorney who specializes in campaign finance compliance. It turns out that same address serves as the official ""address"" of dozens of campaigns.  So why would several groups all have the same address? The answer is not nearly as titillating: Marston's business, Election CFO, contracts with dozens of campaigns and political action committees to provide services that including filling out their financial paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and handle accounting. It's a common practice for political groups to contract out such work to experts trained in navigating the complicated campaign finance regulations. ""People just hire me to be their treasurer,"" Marston told CNN in an interview at his home office in Alexandria. ""I do accounting. Honest to goodness I really just write the checks and make the deposits."" Despite his paper trail affiliation with campaigns and PACs, Marston's role is almost exclusively clerical. His little PO Box isn't the hub for GOP conspiracy meetings and he doesn't involve himself with campaign strategy, messaging or opposition research.  ""My interaction to those folks is mostly limited to paying their invoices,"" he said.  There are many such companies who provide similar services for both Republicans and Democrats.  ""It's not a conspiracy,"" Marston said.","Marston's business, Election CFO, contracts with dozens of campaigns and political action committees to provide services that including filling out their financial paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and handle accounting.

1660,"This is the real reason GTA V hasn’t got any single player DLC ever Grand Theft Auto V has been out for a good few years now but Rockstar is yet to release any single-player DLC for it. This has many gamers thinking as to why there hasn’t been any DLC content released for the game although it was such a massive commercial and critical success. We finally might have an answer to this question thanks to the recently concluded earnings conference call by Take-Two Interactive for Q3 2015. According to Take-Two their net revenue for Q3 was $486.8 million as compared to $954 million in last year’s third quarter. The dip in earnings is mostly due to no notable releases from its stables during this time period while last year had quite a few of them. However, that’s still a large amount of money and most of it is due to one title: Grand Theft Auto V. You might be wondering how that’s possible but it’s obvious. This is due to Grand Theft Auto Online which is the standalone online component of the game. The online product seems to be raking in serious moolah for Take-Two and it’s no surprise that there’s been no single-player DLC pack release for GTA V. Rockstar is busy adding more features to the online experience and releasing DLC for GTA Online regularly and has had no time to focus on GTA V’s single-player aspects. Rockstar is fully committed to improving the experience for gamers and has been known to release several additions to improve the product. This has prevented them from focusing on the single-player game and considering how successful GTA Online has proven to be, it is likely there won’t ever be a single-player DLC pack for GTA V. Take-Two’s promised even more content for GTA Online in days to come which will further boost revenue. When there is money being made, who cares about keeping up old promises such as releasing an expansion pack for the single-player aspect of GTA V? Take-Two clearly doesn’t but don’t write them off completely. We might have an announcement during E3 this year that might prove us wrong (we hope).",Rockstar is busy adding more features to the online experience and releasing DLC for GTA Online regularly and has had no time to focus on GTA V’s single-player aspects.
1661,"Most doctors — and the diabetes associations — portray diabetes as an incurable disease, presaging a steady decline that may include kidney failure , amputations and blindness , as well as life-threatening heart attacks and stroke. Yet the literature on low-carbohydrate intervention for diabetes tells another story. For instance, a two-week study of 10 obese patients with Type 2 diabetes found that their glucose levels normalized and insulin sensitivity was improved by 75 percent after they went on a low-carb diet. At our obesity clinics, we’ve seen hundreds of patients who, after cutting down on carbohydrates, lose weight and get off their medications. One patient in his 50s was a brick worker so impaired by diabetes that he had retired from his job. He came to see one of us last winter, 100 pounds overweight and panicking. He’d been taking insulin prescribed by a doctor who said he would need to take it for the rest of his life. Yet even with insurance coverage, his drugs cost hundreds of dollars a month, which he knew he couldn’t afford, any more than he could bariatric surgery. Instead, we advised him to stop eating most of his meals out of boxes packed with processed flour and grains, replacing them with meat, eggs, nuts and even butter. Within five months, his blood-sugar levels had normalized, and he was back to working part-time. Today, he no longer needs to take insulin. Another patient, in her 60s, had been suffering from Type 2 diabetes for 12 years. She lost 35 pounds in a year on a low-carb diet, and was able to stop taking her three medications, which included more than 100 units of insulin daily. hemoglobin One small trial found that 44 percent of low-carb dieters were able to stop taking one or more diabetes medications after only a few months, compared with 11 percent of a control group following a moderate-carb, lower-fat, calorie-restricted diet. A similarly small trial reported those numbers as 31 percent versus 0 percent. And in these as well as another, larger, trial A1C , which is the primary marker for a diabetes diagnosis, improved significantly more on the low-carb diet than on a low-fat or low-calorie diet. Of course, the results are dependent on patients’ ability to adhere to low-carb diets, which is why some studies have shown that the positive effects weaken over time. A low-carbohydrate diet was in fact standard treatment for diabetes throughout most of the 20th century, when the condition was recognized as one in which ""the normal utilization of carbohydrate is impaired,"" according to a 1923 medical text . When pharmaceutical insulin became available in 1922, the advice changed, allowing moderate amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. Yet in the late 1970s, several organizations, including the Department of Agriculture and the diabetes association, began recommending a high-carb, low-fat diet, in line with the then growing (yet now refuted ) concern that dietary fat causes coronary artery disease. That advice has continued for people with diabetes despite more than a dozen peer-reviewed clinical trials over the past 15 years showing that a diet low in carbohydrates is more effective than one low in fat for reducing both blood sugar and most cardiovascular risk factors. The diabetes association has yet to acknowledge this sizable body of scientific evidence. Its current guidelines find "" no conclusive evidence "" to recommend a specific carbohydrate limit. The organization even tells people with diabetes to maintain carbohydrate consumption, so that patients on insulin don’t see their blood sugar fall too low. That condition, known as hypoglycemia , is indeed dangerous, yet it can better be avoided by restricting carbs and eliminating the need for excess insulin in the first place. Encouraging patients with diabetes to eat a high-carb diet is effectively a prescription for ensuring a lifelong dependence on medication. At the annual diabetes association convention in New Orleans this summer, there wasn’t a single prominent reference to low-carb treatment among the hundreds of lectures and posters publicizing cutting-edge research. Instead, we saw scores of presentations on expensive medications for blood sugar, obesity and liver problems, as well as new medical procedures, including that stomach-draining system, temptingly named AspireAssist, and another involving ""mucosal resurfacing"" of the digestive tract by burning the inside of the duodenum with a hot balloon. We owe our patients with diabetes more than a lifetime of insulin injections and risky surgical procedures. To combat diabetes and spare a great deal of suffering, as well as the $322 billion in diabetes-related costs incurred by the nation each year, doctors should follow a version of that timeworn advice against doing unnecessary harm — and counsel their patients to first, do low carbs.","cutting down on carbohydrates, lose weight"
1663,"Bitcoin. You may have heard the term. You may even know someone who has a bunch of them. But is Bitcoin just a fad that's dying out, or is it here to stay? Let's dive into a brief history of Bitcoin, the troubles it has faced, and the answer to the question on so many lips...is Bitcoin still a thing? What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a form of currency that falls under the umbrella of ""cryptocurrency."" To keep this simple, think of Bitcoin as currency that exists primarily in cyberspace, at a specific Bitcoin address that is linked with an access key. Unlike every other form of currency, it is decentralized, meaning large banks and corporations have no control over it. Plus, Bitcoins are not produced in the same manner as dollars or euros; they are generated by people through a process known as mining, which requires software that can solve complex mathematical problems. Perhaps the biggest selling point of Bitcoin is the finite nature of the currency. There is something called Bitcoin protocol, and it stipulates that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created. That's it. So clearly, as the demand for Bitcoins increases, so, too, does their value. (It's a little like trying to move into a town or city that has outlawed new construction. The houses in that area continue to rise in value as more people want to move in.) Another huge selling point is that it is completely anonymous. Plus, Bitcoin has tiny transaction fees, it's fast, and it's transparent. Every transaction is recorded (which is why Martin Shkreli's claim about losing $15 million in Bitcoins was bogus). How Did Bitcoin Come to Exist? Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoins came into existence in 2008 after his paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published. The idea was to create a low-fee electronic payment system that was free from any central authority, and easily or instantly transferrable. It wasn't until two years later that the first Bitcoins were used, and at the time they were worth less than a penny each (today, Bitcoins are valued at over $560 each, but the price fluctuates daily, and has hit a high of $1216.73). The biggest draw of Bitcoins — anonymity — meant that it became the preferred unit of currency for illegal activities on the online black market, such as the now shuttered Silk Road. However, as the price of Bitcoins rose meteorically, people who simply wanted to make money took an interest. How Do You Acquire Bitcoins? You can set up an account at Bitcoin.org in seconds. Once there, you choose a wallet, and can then get Bitcoins in a few different ways: Simply purchase them. You can set up a currency exchange with your bank, and have the Bitcoins (or pieces of a Bitcoin) deposited in your account. You can accept Bitcoins as a payment for goods or services. If you sell items online, you can ask to be paid in Bitcoins. If you freelance, you can do the same thing. It's not easy at the moment, but as more retailers and people realize the value of Bitcoins, it could become as natural as using PayPal. Mine Bitcoins. This is the hardest part. It would take a much longer article to explain it all, but just know it is not exactly a walk in the park. With the current difficulty level and requisite hardware, it will take you 1,367 years to mine just one Bitcoin! What Troubles Have Plagued Bitcoin? Aside from being associated with the sale and purchase of illegal guns, drugs, and other black market goods and services, Bitcoin has certainly had some setbacks. For starters, Bitcoin is a digital currency, and anything digital comes with hackers ready to find a weakness and exploit it. Just last week, a major Bitcoin exchange called Bitfinex was hacked, and 120,000 Bitcoins (roughly $60 million) were stolen. Back in 2014, another exchange, MtGox, was hacked and lost over 850,000 Bitcoins, valued at the time at over $620 million! Not only that, but some authorities refuse to even acknowledge that Bitcoin is a legitimate currency. Recently, a judge in Florida ruled that Bitcoin was not considered money because it ""cannot be hidden under a mattress like cash or gold bars."" Ironically, this statement is going to have people running to use Bitcoin if they now realize they can legally launder money with it. What's more, you can actually have physical Bitcoins. You can even print them with a 3D printer. As long as they are linked to a Bitcoin address, and have an access key, they work. But for millions of people, this idea of money existing only in cyberspace is very disconcerting. So...Is Bitcoin Still a Thing? In a word, yes. Although the price of a Bitcoin is less than half what it was in 2013, the thing that makes Bitcoin a success is usage. Several years ago, few retailers were willing to touch Bitcoin as a method of payment. Now, more and more blue chip, big name companies are taking Bitcoin, and as more join the list, Bitcoin will become even more enticing. Here are just a few of the many companies now taking the cryptocurrency: Expedia NewEgg Amazon Overstock AliExpress With so many big names willing to accept Bitcoins, and the price of them rising as more people get into the market, Bitcoins are still viable and may even become more attractive to the average consumer. So, if you're interested, you may want to consider getting in sooner rather than later. After all, the person who spent 10,000 Bitcoins on two pizzas back in 2010 would have $4 million today! Are you over Bitcoin and cryptocurrency? Or are you still mining?","With so many big names willing to accept Bitcoins, and the price of them rising as more people get into the market, Bitcoins are still viable and may even become more attractive to the average consumer."
1666,"The mystery behind China’s giant pyramid hills has intrigued archaeologists, historians and UFO conspiracy theorists ever since their existence was first documented in 1945 by a US Air Force pilot named James Gaussman. During a flight between China and India, the American pilot reported seeing a gigantic white-topped pyramid in a level valley after banking to avoid a mountain. He described it as looking like something out of a fairy tale. ""It was pure white on all sides. The remarkable thing was the capstone, a huge piece of jewel-like material that could have been crystal. There was no way we could have landed, although we wanted to. We were struck by the immensity of the thing,"" recalled Gaussman, according to Walter Hain’s article ""Pyramids in China"". In March 1947, the New York Times published an interview with Colonel Maurice Sheahan, the Far Eastern director of Trans World Airlines, who stated that he had seen a gigantic pyramid 65 kilometres southwest of Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi Province located in northwest China. A couple of days later, the same newspaper published a photo (see below), which was later attributed to Gaussman. Above: James Gaussman's 1945 photo of the 'White Pyramid'. The White Pyramid Over the years, there have been subsequent reports of almost 100 other pyramids located across the Qin Chuan Plains in Shaanxi Province and most are located within 100 kilometres of Xi’an. At first, information about these pyramids was hard to come by, since most were located inside so-called ""forbidden zones"". With the opening up of China, these areas became accessible to tourists and foreign travellers. In 1994, Hartwig Hausdorf, a German travel agent and author, wrote a book called Die Weisse Pyramide (The White Pyramid). The book contained photographs of pyramid-like mounds that proved once and for all that China indeed has pyramids. In his 2009 article, author Hain writes that from the ground these pyramidal mounds look more like hills, making it hard for people to associate them with pyramids. Hain, whose interests include the study of ancient structures, used modern technology to pinpoint the exact location of the pyramids. ""I used Google Earth to search over China. I looked at the coordinates that were mentioned in a book by [New Zealand author] Bruce Cathie. The view from the satellite showed these pyramids quite clearly."" Above: Location of the ‘White Pyramid’ is also known as the Maoling Mausoleum 1, the final resting place of Emperor Wu Di, the fifth ruler of the Western Han Dynasty. No extra-terrestrial explanations There’s no need to look for extra-terrestrial explanations to understand the Chinese pyramids because they were built for the same reason as the Great Pyramids of Egypt: as a final resting place for rulers. Experts have confirmed that the White Pyramid is the burial mound of Emperor Wu Di (156-87 BCE), the fifth ruler of the Western Han Dynasty. The mausoleum is the biggest of five burial mounds in the city of Xianyang, which used to be known as Wulingyuan, meaning the ‘garden complex of five tombs’. During the Western Han Dynasty, the construction of a mausoleum for the emperor could begin in the second year of his reign, with a third of the annual revenue allocated to the building of this tomb. It took 53 years to be completed. According to China.org, these grave sites were ""marked by earth mounds packed into square shapes with level tops."" Because of their square shape, they were called fangshang. The biggest pyramid is 46.5 metres high and 240 meters long at the base, while the top section measures 39.5 metres by 35.5 metres. Incidentally, ‘Maoling’ is also the name of one of the Ming Dynasty Tombs found near Beijing, so don’t confuse the two. Today the Maoling Mausoleum is a popular tourist destination that also has a museum dedicated to the Western Han Dynasty period, boasting more than 4,000 excavated treasures and cultural relics.

1671,"At a glance you would be forgiven for thinking that this is just a photo of six friends posing on a beach together. However, look a little closer and eagle eyed readers may be able to spot that there is something very odd about the picture. The photograph shared on Instagram appears to show six friends enjoying the sun on the beach. Leaning toward the camera the mates appear to have all adopted a similar pose and are wearing matching black sunglasses. But those with a keen eye may be able to spot that the photograph has been tampered with. A social media user has photoshopped the face of a man in the background onto the six faces of the women. Once you're aware of the edit to the picture it can seem blindingly obvious however plenty of Instagram users admit that they were stumped. One user commented on the photo to say: 'Oh my f***ing God I can't breathe. Jesus Christ I almost fell'. Another admitted: 'It took me 9 hours to figure it out' This is not the first photo to baffle the Internet withe hidden details. Earlier this year a seemingly mundane photo of three women sitting on a park bench left the internet in a state of confusion.  At first glance the photo appears to show the trio pausing for a sit down during a sunny stroll.  But there's something wrong with the image that only become obvious on closer inspection.   The photo, which was originally shared on Imgur, has recently resurfaced online to cause confusion.  On close inspection, there appears to be no seat on the bench and the women are hovering mid air.  The most likely explanation is that the bench features smaller pull out seats.   The snap is the latest in a long line of optical illusion photos to leave people baffled.  A photo of a bed with a part of the duvet circled in red went viral this week - with many not realising that the picture is really an optical illusion. Within the red ring there's a section of a white duvet covered in a black floral pattern, as well as part of the carpet.  However, people who have spotted the image - which has been shared on Reddit - are struggling to work out what the circle signifies. The image was posted by Imgur user Idon'tevenknowwhat'sgoingon yesterday, and has received more than 63,500 views. Optical illusions are increasingly popular online. At first glance the below picture looks like a regular selfie of a woman striking a seductive pose on her bed. However, if you look closer you will see that something is not quite right with the black and white image. The shot has been driving the web to distraction ever since it went viral, with puzzlers unable to figure out the oddity.  The image has recently resurfaced on Facebook after it first originated in 2003, when it was posted by Deviantart user Missmiserystock. It was titled 'Look-carefully'.  At closer inspection it is revealed that the woman actually has six fingers instead of five. The subtle abnormality is likely to be a clever trick of Photoshop, designed to confuse. One internet user, Bogina, wrote: 'Hahaha thats insane it took me a while to catch it good job!' [sic]  But are your eyes sharp enough to solve this brain teaser driving the web crazy?  It is just the latest in a series of brain teasing images baffling the internet. An image of a floral carpet, uploaded by Jeya May Cruz from Pasig, the Philippines, was shared nearly 16,000 times and reached 120,000 reactions. Why? Because the photograph contains a camouflaged mobile phone that is devilishly hard to spot.   If you are struggling, the phone has a floral pattern which does not quite match the carpet.  Still confused? The device is just beside the right side table leg at the top of the photo. It may seem a simple find, but it has left thousands bewildered. Jeya captioned her image: 'Since I can't sleep, let's play a game. Look for the cellphone.' She works as a sales representative at Dell, and studied Banking and Finance at Far Eastern University.  Sometimes the easiest-sounding brain teasers are the most difficult ones. And another puzzle to recently sweep the web certainly plays by those rules. Scroll down for the reveal!

1675,"(An F-35B from Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 (VMFAT-501), flies near its base a MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina.Lockheed Martin) An F-35B just An F-35B just carried out a remarkable test where its sensors spotted an airborne target, sent the data to an Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense site, and had the land-based outpost fire a missile to defeat the target — thereby destroying an airborne adversary without firing a single shot of its own. This development simultaneously vindicates two of the US military's most important developments: The F-35 and the Naval Integrated Fire Control Counterair Network (NIFC-CA). Essentially, the NIFC-CA revolutionizes naval targeting systems by combining data from a huge variety of sensors to generate targeting data that could be used to defeat incoming threats. View photos Standard Missile-6 More (The U.S. Navy Arleigh-Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53) launches a RIM-174 Standard ERAM (Standard Missile-6, SM-6) during a live-fire test of the ship's Aegis weapons system in the Pacific Ocean.US Navy) So now with this development, an F-35 can pass targeting data to the world's most advanced missile defense system, an Aegis site, that would fire it's own missile, likely a SM-6, to take out threats in the air, on land, or at sea. This means that an F-35 can stealthily enter heavily contested enemy air space , detect threats, and have them destroyed by a missile fired from a remote site, like an Aegis land site or destroyer, without firing a shot and risking giving up it's position. The SM-6, the munition of choice for Aegis destroyers, is a 22-foot long supersonic missile that can seek out, maneuver, and destroy airborne targets like enemy jets or incoming cruise or ballistic missiles. The SM-6's massive size prohibits it from being equipped to fighter jets, but now, thanks to the integration of the F-35 with the NIFC-CA, it doesn't have to. The SM-6, as effective and versatile as it is, can shoot further than the Aegis sites can see. The F-35, as an ultra connective and stealthy jet, acts as an elevated, highly mobile sensor that extends the effective range of the missile. This joint capability helps assuage fears over the F-35's limited capacity to carry ordnance. The jet's stealth design means that all weapons have to be stored internally, and this strongly limits the plane's overall ordnance capacity. This limiting factor has drawn criticism from pundits more fond of traditional jet fighting approaches. However, it seems the F-35's connectivity has rendered this point a non-issue. Overall, the F-35 and NIFC-CA integration changes the game when it comes to the supposed anti-access/area denial bubbles created by Russia and China's advanced air defenses and missiles. ""One of the key defining attributes of a 5th Generation fighter is the force multiplier effect it brings to joint operations through its foremost sensor fusion and external communications capabilities,"" said Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in a statement View photos f-35 nifc-ca More","An F-35B just An F-35B just carried out a remarkable test where its sensors spotted an airborne target, sent the data to an Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense site, and had the land-based outpost fire a missile to defeat the target — thereby destroying an airborne adversary without firing a single shot of its own."
1676,"DENVER — The mosasaur, a fearsome marine reptile that stalked the Cretaceous seas, scavenged its own kind, a new fossil find reveals. A fossilized mosasaur found in Angola contains the partial remains of three other mosasaurs in its stomach, researchers reported here Tuesday (Oct. 29) at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. ""These are three different species of mosasaur inside the belly of a fourth species of mosasaur,"" said study researcher Louis Jacobs, a vertebrate paleontologist at Southern Methodist University in Texas. [T-Rex of the Seas: A Mosasaur Gallery] The find isn't the first example of mosasaurs digesting mosasaurs, but it illuminates an ancient ecosystem surprisingly similar to ones seen in parts of the ocean today. A lean, mean, eating machine The fossilized skeleton of a mosasaur with the bones of three other species of mosasaur in its gut. The marine monster likely scavenged upon carcasses brought to the west coast of Africa by trade winds. Mosasaurs were at the top of the marine food chain from about 98 million years ago to the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago, when they went extinct. As is the case for modern whales, the first mosasaur ancestors were land-dwellers. They looked not unlike today's monitor lizards, said study researcher Michael Polcyn, also a vertebrate paleontologist at Southern Methodist University. ""By the time they're in the water maybe 10 million years, they've fully adapted to the marine environment — so a downturned tail with a dorsal fluke and fins — and they were really making their living like a toothed whale,"" Polcyn told LiveScience. In other words, mosasaurs were as fearsome predators as today's orcas, but with reptilian, fishlike bodies that could grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) in length. A rich ecosystem The mosasaur with a belly full of other mosasaurs was found at a site called Bentiaba in southern Angola. The fossils are embedded in sandstone cliffs and badlands along the Atlantic coast. During the Cretaceous, this area was just offshore from Africa. What big teeth you have! The jaw of the mosasaur Prognathodon kianda. ""The incredible richness of the site continues to amaze us,"" Polcyn said. ""Each year we return, there is another significant discovery."" The researchers first discovered the hungry, hungry mosasaur, a species called (Prognathodon kianda), in 2006, but weren't able to excavate it until 2010. That's when they realized the fossil record also recorded the mosasaur's last meal. The mosasaurs inside the belly are clearly digested, with their tooth enamel eaten away by stomach acid. One is small and eaten whole, but the other two are incomplete, mostly represented by skulls and vertebrae — ""not the most nutritious and tasty stuff that you would eat,"" Jacobs said. The evidence points to the large mosasaur as a scavenger, snacking on the corpses of dead mosasaurs brought to the area by the currents. Bentiaba badlands in southern Angola. This area is a rich site for fossils that were laid down when the land was slightly offshore during the Cretaceous period. The mosasaurs are only part of the story. Paleontologists digging at the site have already uncovered seven mosasaur species, two plesiosaurs, nine sharks and rays, four kinds of turtles and many fish. Virtually all the bones show evidence of scavenging by sharks. The ecosystem likely owed its richness to the trade winds, prevailing winds that blow between 15 degrees and 30 degrees North and South latitude. At the time, this stretch of coast fell squarely under the influence of these winds, Polcyn said. The winds drive ocean currents that cause upwelling, the circulation of nutrient-rich bottom waters up to the ocean's surface. Such upwelling zones have robust food chains, starting from plankton and ending with large predators. The currents also would have pushed floating carcasses toward shore, Polcyn said. Rich upwelling zones are common in the oceans today, including a spot off of Monterey, Calif., known for its sea otters and other fauna; a stretch of sea off the Atacama Desert in western South America; and the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem off the coast of Namibia. The Benguela ecosystem is fueled by the same atmospheric processes that drove the mid-Cretaceous hotspot of life, Polcyn said. The continent of Africa has moved and rotated just slightly over the intervening millions of years, shifting the relative location of the upwelling. The mosasaur specimen with a full belly is still being prepared by fossil technicians. Researchers have also uncovered other ancient beasts with creatures in their gut at the site, Polcyn said, and they plan to analyze those finds further.

1678,"CHICAGO (AP) — Four black people accused of beating a mentally disabled white man and broadcasting the attack on Facebook appeared Friday in court, where a judge asked them, ""Where was your sense of decency?"" Prosecutors offered new details of the assault, explaining that one of the suspects demanded $300 from the victim’s mother and that the beating started in a van and continued at a house. The suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt. Authorities say they also threatened him with a knife and taunted him with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. The 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said. The suspects are all are charged with two hate crimes — one because the kid was disabled and one because of race. They are also accused of kidnapping and battery, among other offenses. The suspects were identified as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington’s 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. Cook County Associate Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil denied bond for all four. Two of the suspects were arrested as juveniles on armed robbery and other serious charges. Hill was arrested in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. The beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media. The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon. The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential election campaign that split the nation. The case heightened political tensions on social media, with some conservatives suggesting it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection. Excerpts of the video posted by Chicago media outlets show the victim with his mouth taped shut and slumped in a corner of a room. At least two assailants are seen cutting off his sweatshirt, and others taunt him off camera. The video shows a wound on the top of the man’s head. One person pushes the man’s head with his or her foot. A red band also appears to be around the victim’s hands. He was tied up for four to five hours, authorities said. The incident began New Year’s Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald’s to begin what both the victim and his parents believed would be a sleepover, police said. Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, Detective Commander Kevin Duffin said. The victim told police what began as playful fighting escalated. A downstairs neighbor who heard noises threatened to call police. When two of the suspects left and kicked down the neighbor’s door, the victim escaped. A police officer later spotted the bloodied and obviously disoriented man wandering down a street. The victim’s parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The police report said the victim’s mother knew the first name of her son’s friend — Jordan — but wasn’t clear on his last name. The report also noted that the victim ""does not like telling his parents who he’s with."" The parents later received text messages ""from persons claiming to be holding him captive,"" police said. While investigating the messages, police discovered the Facebook video.

Of all the beauty myths that never made a whole lot of sense, this old wives’ tale probably takes the cake: if you pull out one gray hair, a bunch more will grow back. Once and for all, here’s the truth. Not only is this weird saying totally false–it’s also biologically impossible. ""The hair follicle (the little tube beneath the skin that contains the root of the hair) only contains one hair,"" says Carly Bowers, expert for Latest-Hairstyles.com. ""Pulling out one gray hair won’t cause two hairs to grow in its place; it will simply eliminate the hair until another one grows back in it’s place."" I’m afraid there is a bit of bad news, however: if you happen to find a single gray hair, pulling it so you can get on with your life isn’t a good solution. ""Plucking each hair will just cause them to grow back and they will grow back gray,"" says Dr. David E. Bank, founder of The Center for Dermatology, Cosmetic & Laser Surgery. ""The reason? The pigment-producing cells at the hair follicle are most likely worn out so matter what you do, the hair will grow back gray."" Gray hair occurs when melanocytes in the hair stop producing melanin, causing pigment loss, Bank explains. ""This is mainly caused by genetics, but it can occur with prolonged illness or stress. Even medications such as chemo-therapeutics, Ferritin, Vitamin D3, Methotrexate, Lithium, Echinacea and Vitamin E may lead to gray hair,"" Bank says. In addition to not being effective, plucking hairs can also cause permanent damage and scarring to the hair follicle, says Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse at Rapaport Dermatology of Beverly Hills. ""In this case, the hair would be unable to grow back at all, and you would have a bald spot where that hair was,"" Shainhouse says. ""True, it would be small, but if you keep plucking out the grays, you could cause permanent thinning of your hair."" Your best bet when trying to cover up a few grays is to use a permanent marker, says Shainhouse, or a temporary hair color like L’Oreal Paris Root Rescue, which comes with a special applicator designed to make root application a breeze. ""If a person finds one or two gray hairs and doesn’t want to have to change her color, there are plenty of very temporary solutions,"" Bowers says. ""Using a colored hair powder only on the area where the gray hairs are will work. Bumble and Bumble makes a great one.

1690,"The story of 15-year-old Olivia shocked many people. Her doctor didn’t believe her until he discovered piece of evidence inside of her arm. Here are details of her story. Imagine that you’re a 15-year-old and you’re very excited because you’re going to the big city of Los Angeles to visit your uncle for the summer. You’ll be away from your parents and you’ll get that little bit of freedom you’ve been wanting! When you get there, your uncle offers you a fruity drink, and you could swear it had alcohol in it. You start to feel dizzy and the next thing you know, you wake up on a mattress in a dark room and you don’t have any clothes on. Your body feels heavy and you can barely stay awake. Many questions circle in your mind: where are you? Where is your uncle? Why am you in pain? Why is there a bloody cut on your arm? That 15-year-old girl is a real victim of human trafficking. Her uncle was involved in a ring of people who would find young girls to drug up and sell for pr@stitution. That young girl was finally rescued after 3 years of torture. Shockingly, she survived and lives to tell her story, but she is just one girl in the hundreds of cases reported each year. Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery. According to the Trafficking Resource Center, there are 1,654 human trafficking cases reported this year. The most common form is $ex trafficking, which can make big money for the predators. California has the highest number of human trafficking victims, followed by Texas and Florida. How Olivia got out of the ring of human traffickers will shock you. Her uncle dumped her outside of a hospital after 3 long years of being his slave. He couldn’t sell her anymore because she was then 8 months pregnant. Now 18-years-old, the hospital crew brought her inside the hospital. It took several days for all the drugs to wear off and for her to be conscious enough to talk to the doctor. Once she was able to talk, she insisted that she had a tracking device in her arm. Because of her dazed look in her eyes and messy appearance, doctors thought she was just another pill seeker. They and wanted to get her out as soon as possible. Doctors also knew that tracking devices are most commonly used on dogs and cats to keep track of their whereabouts. One doctor decided to take a look at her arm, and to their amazement, there was a little scar. Upon opening up the scar, the doctor saw a little metal chip, known as a radio frequency identification chip (RFID) in her arm. Everyone in the room was stunned. No one knew that these chips were actually used on humans. Olivia began to piece together what had happened to her over the 3 years of abuse. She had been been passed from man to man and was always on the go. Every few weeks, her uncle would show up to collect money and arrange where she would go next.This is why he had to implant the tracking device: to always know exactly where to find her. Police and other authorities work tirelessly to find these criminals and put an end to this horrific crime. Many survivors like Olivia have gained the courage to speak out on the matter and educate the public on what to look for in victims.

1699,"The cracks first emerged in April. By 29 June 1995, a vast network of fissures spanned the entire fifth floor ceiling of one of Seoul’s busiest department stores. Hours later, loud bangs could be heard coming from the roof. The cracks widened. An emergency board meeting was called but the chairman flatly refused to evacuate, citing lost profits. Then he fled the building. At 5pm the fifth floor ceiling began to sink. Shopping continued as usual, until the alarms were finally sounded nearly an hour later. But it was too late. The roof went next, followed by the building’s main support columns, sending the entire south wing crashing into the basement. 1,500 people were trapped – including the chairman’s own stepdaughter – and 502 never made it out of the building. The Sampooning collapse is an example of how fragile modern engineering can be. Even with materials, equipment and an advanced understanding of physics, the building didn’t last five years, let alone 5,000. Meanwhile the Egyptian Pyramids have been drawing crowds for millennia. Unfazed by earthquakes, erosion or vandalism, they’ve endured the collapse of the civilisation that built them and the transformation of the Sahara from lush grassland into today’s vast desert. Of these, the Great Pyramid of Giza – completed in 2540 BC – is unrivalled, with superior materials, engineering and design to any built before or since. Ancient Greek tourists would travel thousands of miles to gawk at its towering limestone steps, which were so highly polished they were said to glow; their names can be found carved into its walls to this day. Remarkably, Cleopatra lived closer in history to today’s tallest building – the Burj Khalifa – than she did to this monumental tomb. When the last mammoths died out, it was already 1,000 years old. Constructions must withstand immense forces just to stay upright, including regular lightning strikes and spiralling 100-mile per hour winds It was the Burj of its day, towering above every other building until the spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed around 700 years ago. ""The ancient Egyptians were creating a – I hate to say it – launching pad for the deceased, so they could get up there with the Sun and the stars,"" says Donald Redford, who has been studying the pyramids for over four decades. Fast-forward to 2016 and we’re piercing the heavens with ever-taller buildings, from looming clock towers to 20-storey robots, to the possibility of the first mile-high building – though it’s not yet clear if the latter is even possible. We’re entering the age of the skyscraper, as people move out of the countryside and pour into ever-crowded cities. The constructions must withstand immense forces just to stay upright, including regular lightning strikes and spiralling 100-mile per hour winds – not to mention the constant effect of gravity. In some areas you can add major earthquakes to that list. What was the pyramids’ secret? And do today’s skyscrapers stand a chance of outlasting them? In fact, the impressive age of the pyramids is no accident. The ancient Egyptians believed the afterlife would last forever and took great pains to ensure their tombs would too. Pyramid design evolved over thousands of years, as they experimented with the materials and architecture that would live up to their ambitions. ""They were always saying this is a construction ‘for eternity’; ‘for ever and ever’ creeps into their vocabulary constantly,"" says Redford, who currently works at Penn State University, Pennsylvania. They were so confident in their abilities, many pyramids were named with the suffix ""of millions and millions of years"". They designed these buildings to last forever – nowadays that’s not a priority – Roma Agrawal, structural engineer Despite their efforts and hyperbolic claims, the Egyptians didn’t really know what they were doing – and this may have been a distinct advantage. To make up for gaps in their understanding of the laws of physics, early pyramids were heavily over-engineered. They knew about columns, for example, but didn’t know that they could support a roof. They always added extra walls just in case. Another explanation is sheer size. Take the Great Pyramid. It’s less a building than an artificial mountain, made of nearly six million tonnes of solid rock. Five millennia is no time whatsoever when you consider the limestone had been lying in the ground for 50 million or so. Modern skyscrapers, in comparison, are positively flimsy. It took just 110,000 tonnes of concrete and 39,000 tonnes of steel to construct the Burj, which is more than six times the height of the Great Pyramid. ""They designed these buildings to last forever – nowadays that’s not a priority. We’re designing practical buildings to be lived in,"" says Roma Agrawal, a structural engineer who worked on the Shard in London. Just like early pyramids, the earliest generation of skyscrapers may be the most robust. When a B-25 plane crashed into the Empire State Building in 1945, the building was reopened in a matter of days. ""Back in the early 20th Century they were still calculating everything by hand, so they always added extra steel just in case,"" Agrawal. Though the Empire State Building is less than half the height of the Burj, it weighs two-thirds as much. In addition to all the usual risks, building into the clouds carries some entirely of its own. To make it to 7,000 AD – roughly equivalent to the lifespan of the pyramids today – skyscrapers must run the gauntlet of thousands of years of rain, wind and storms. ""The dominant factor with tall buildings is the wind,"" says Bill Baker, the structural engineer behind the Burj. As wind rushes past a streamlined object, such as a tree or a lamppost, it whirls into a single organised gust, which circles round to the left, then back to the right, then left again, pushing from alternating directions as it travels and causing the object to sway. In high winds the Burj can sway up to five feet in either direction. Important buildings like the Burj Khalifa are designed for events which occur just once in nearly two millennia The trouble is, the higher up you go, the faster the wind gets. To stop skyscrapers falling over – and those at the top getting seasick – they are designed with irregular shapes which disrupt the wind and stop it becoming organised. It may look like an architectural flourish, but the distinctive jagged profiles of the Burj and the Shard are more for safety than artistry. Even a hurricane wouldn’t push them over. ""If it’s a normal building you might design it to withstand the kind of wind storm you’d expect to happen once every 700 years,"" says Baker. Important buildings like the Burj Khalifa are designed for events which occur just once in nearly two millennia. Then there’s lightning. The United Arab Emirates, home to the Burj, experiences about 10 lightning storms per year. With up to a billion volts of electricity in a single bolt, skyscrapers are at risk of being hit by a force with more power than a nuclear reactor. ""I’ve been in Dubai during a lightning storm and the Burj is like the lightning rod for the entire city – every minute or so it will get hit,"" says Baker. Luckily there’s a workaround. During construction, the building’s steel ""skin"" is wired together – every steel bar, every window frame, – right the way down to the foundations. It works like a giant Faraday cage, a protective enclosure similar to the wire mesh on microwave ovens, which keeps its contents safe by restricting electricity to the outside. ""I’ve talked to the maintenance people after some big storms and they don’t pick up any damage,"" says Baker. Just like bending a paperclip back and forth, if steel is tested too many times, eventually it will snap Even in an earthquake, skyscrapers are extremely sturdy. In fact, the faster the shaking, the better. It’s all down to a phenomenon known as resonance. If the ground is shaking at a frequency which matches the rate at which a building sways, it will keep swaying faster and faster and might eventually collapse. ""Slender buildings take a long time to sway back and forth – for the Burj it’s about 11 seconds – so it will move but it won’t break,"" says Baker. It’s not entirely failsafe: just like bending a paperclip back and forth, if steel is tested too many times, eventually it will snap. But the recent blockbuster in which a catastrophic Magnitude 9 ripples through San Francisco – sending skyscrapers toppling to the ground – would in reality have made far less compelling viewing. In fact the real perils are as pedestrian as it gets. ""It’s mainly about keeping the water out,"" says Baker. Back in the 1930s, 96 of the world’s 100 tallest buildings were made of steel. Today most cityscapes are built from concrete reinforced with steel, which combines the tensile strength (ability to resist stretching), of metal with the compressive strength (ability to resist squeezing) of rock. When kept dry, reinforced concrete is a wonder material which may last forever. But in areas of high rainfall, mild acids in the water will slowly react with the limestone in cement and wear it away – turning steel to rust and riddling the building with holes. ""The fact that the pyramids are in an arid environment is extremely important,"" says Michel Barsoum, a materials scientist at Drexel University, Philadelphia. Even in the sun-baked Sahara, early pyramids crumbled under the destructive power of frost, which expanded as it formed on chilly desert nights and prised open gaps in the limestone blocks. Even with a double layer of glass, without regular maintenance most windows aren’t likely to last long For years it was thought that the Egyptians had eventually figured this one out by learning to carve blocks with a tighter fit, though how exactly remained a mystery. Then in the early 2000s someone finally peered at the rocks under a high-resolution microscope. It was Barsoum, who had been tipped off that the rocks weren’t natural limestone at all, but had been cast from an early form of cement. Though he was a ceramics expert – Barsoum had never studied pyramids in his life – he couldn’t resist the challenge of finding out. Deep inside the ancient blocks, he found tell-tale signs: microscopic algae, called diatoms, whose hard shells had been partially dissolved by the alkaline cement. ""Around 90% of the pyramid is carved stone – but the rest is cast,"" says Barsoum. The Egyptians made their rocks from four main ingredients; limestone, lime, water and mud. These reacted together to form a chemical glue. The neat part is that as it ages, the glue reverts back to its raw ingredients, turning the cement back into rock. ""It looks smells and tastes like natural limestone,"" says Barsoum. But if the main concrete shell of a skyscraper may be relatively resilient, the fate of the their windows is less straightforward. Glass has the weight of granite and the stiffness of aluminium; it would take 10 tonnes of pressure to crush a single 1cm cube. Even in the sea, it can take up to 50 years of tumbling to wear into the colourful frosted pebbles found on beaches. And yet it can spontaneously fail. ""It will shatter just sitting there. No one knows why,"" says Baker. Even with a double layer of glass, without regular maintenance most windows aren’t likely to last long. ""Glass isn’t much affected by the environment, but eventually windows will break away after the consequences of time due to wind vibrations, storms, etc,"" says Konstantinos Tsavdaridis, a materials scientist at the University of Leeds. Finally, would the glass eventually flow towards the bottom of the frame? The idea is based on medieval windows – which appear to be thicker lower down – and the myth that glass is actually an extremely viscous liquid: over hundreds of years, glass was thought to flow to the underside of the frame. Back in 1998, this popular idea was decisively disproven by a team of physicists, who calculated that it would take a number of years ""well beyond the age of the universe"" to produce any noticeable change at room temperature. Instead the uneven thickness of antique windows is thought to be entirely accidental – making flat panes of glass wasn’t easy a few hundred years ago. So will today’s skyscrapers last as long as the pyramids? Bill Baker thinks there’s a good chance they might. ""The structural materials are good for pretty much ever. Yes if they maintain them and no if they don’t,"" he says. Agrawal agrees. ""It depends. If they are looked after I don’t see why not,"" she says. In the end, most skyscrapers are more likely to be torn down than fall down According to Konstantinos, concrete structures will last longer, since rust sets in long before concrete begins to crumble. Either way, Redford is not convinced. ""I very much doubt it. They are functional structures for sure, but they will last only as long as there is a need for that function. And then they will simply be abandoned,"" he says. In the end, most skyscrapers are more likely to be torn down than fall down. In fact the Great Pyramid was not the only impressive building around 4,500 years ago. One of them, known as The Labyrinth, was reportedly even more extraordinary. ""When the Greek historian Herodotus saw it, it took his breath away. He could not describe the size and the weight of some of the huge blocks that went into construction,"" says Redford. Try and find the building today and it’s been completely levelled. The rocks were plundered and used as building materials elsewhere. ""If you wander the streets of old Cairo and look at the foundations of old buildings, you’ll sometimes see Hieroglyphic inscriptions which come from this very building,"" says Redford. If we don’t tear down any skyscrapers in say, New York – and they don’t fall over – then at the current rate of construction there will be 10,000 buildings over 160 metres tall in the city by the year 7,000. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad if some of them went the way of the Labyrinth after all.",they will last only as long as there is a need for that function
1700,"Find yourself sniffling over a cute puppy video? For some, crying isn't a rare occurrence. The tears can flow for seemingly no reason at all, and although people may accuse you of being too sensitive, experts say there may be an actual scientific reason why you're more tearful than your dry-eyed friends. There isn't a definitive reason as to why some of us cry more than the average person, but experts point to a range of factors including gender and whether a person may have experienced trauma in their past. Men are predisposed to avoid crying, since doing so can interfere with the way peers perceive them. And while it's true that some women are more prone to waterworks during that time of the month, other factors that may come into play include birth control pills and hormonal fluctuations that can occur around menopause. Of course it's also no surprise that if you're bogged down at work and aren't getting enough sleep, that can also play into why your tear ducts are working in overdrive. The solution? Make sure you're getting eight hours of sleep at night and try meditation or yoga to bring stress levels down. But even if you do end up weeping a little too often, don't fret. According to a Health.com article, ""past studies have found that crying can have soothing, mood-boosting effects."" If your crying is becoming a persistent problem though, talk to your doctor as it may be a sign of depression.

1705,"Let’s settle this, once and for all: Clickbaiting is the intentional act of over-promising or otherwise misrepresenting — in a headline, on social media, in an image, or some combination — what you’re going to find when you read a story on the web. Currently, clickbait is often characterized by wording like, ""You won’t believe"" or ""What happened next will shock you,"" or other unverifiable assertions in a desperate attempt to spark your curiosity into a click. Publishers who practice clickbait social strategy the most reliably are often viral mills like Distractify and ViralNova. (ClickHole is a fun example because it parodies clickbait so effectively that its headlines still work as clickbait.) At its worst, this strategy indicates that the publisher is at a loss for how to sell audiences on a story (perhaps due to having sub par content to begin with). Sometimes you’ll find these headlines on social media or on traffic-generating widgets like Taboola, click on them and find yourself with an unoriginal story that just repeats (or even distorts) facts from another site that reported the story first. If you’re really lucky, you’ll get to click through multiple pages before you realize how lame the story really is. Why do publishers do it? Two words: page views. Most sites use traffic numbers like page views or unique visitors to bill advertisers and measure their general success. Being a news site isn’t easy, business-wise. Most publishers are guilty of using clickbait to promote stories because when it comes down to it, you still click. Readers will take the bait and the publisher is rewarded with a page view. Anyone who’s trying to distribute information online is at the mercy of the big companies like Facebook and Google that help people discover their content. Publishers are constantly challenged by changing algorithms and the task of reframing and optimizing stories for social distribution — which is why the formula for clickbait might change, but the existence of sensationalistic, attention-grabbing headlines never quite goes away. For publishers, there’s an extremely delicate balance when it comes to having great content and great framing, and staying on-brand is even more important. Having a site that’s discoverable on social media, loads quickly, includes engaging photos and videos, is easy to navigate, leaves you having learned something new, doesn’t spam you with pop ups and doesn’t crash your phone — pulling it all off is tough. So there’s a series of trade offs at work facing anyone who’s trying to make money from content in the oh-so-flawed world of online publishing. Who decides what is and isn’t clickbait? While there are some terrible headlines that qualify as the worst of the worst, there’s also an enormous gray area, which is one of the reasons the word gets thrown around so often, sometimes leading to heated arguments about whether or not a story is clickbait. In the tech world, Nellie Bowles has suggested that executives and investors will disparage any story that paints them in an unflattering light as ""clickbait"" — something that plenty of TechCrunch writers have experienced. Indeed, one of the authors of this post used to work with an editor who suggested that ""clickbait"" was just another word for ""writing stories that people want to read."" Or consider BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith’s assertion that his site ""doesn’t do clickbait,"" a statement that may have set a media industry record for number of eyebrows raised. But in Smith’s view, no matter how ridiculous or attention-grabbing a BuzzFeed headline might be, the story gives you exactly what’s promised. For Smith, the key distinction lies in deception. With real clickbait, the headline might promise Paris Hilton topless, or a weird trick that will help you lose weight — and then completely fail to deliver. On the other hand, you might not like yourself for clicking on a headline about Kim Kardashian or cute pugs — but if you click, then you can’t exactly claim to be disappointed when you’re served a superficial, gossipy story, or a gallery of unbearably cute dog photos. Oh, and yes, some readers might also think that a story headlined, ""WTF is clickbait?"" is clickbait itself. The fact is, TechCrunch is fighting your attention along with everyone else. But hopefully after clicking, you got what you were expecting — or something even better! Why is clickbait bad? It’s bad for both sides. It’s obviously annoying to have your social feeds spammed by over-promising headlines that lead you to an under-delivering half-stories on domains that crash your phone. But clickbait is also one of the easiest ways for a publisher to lose their audience’s trust over time. You might click at first, but if you’re smart reader, you’re going to become more hesitant and suspicious — and you’re probably going to share a story that disappoints you. For publishers: You can’t just can’t use headlines as a means to an end, and overusing a clickbait social strategy implies that you don’t understand your audience. One size fits all is stupid. Treat your audience like it’s smart, and remember the complexities of the modern media landscape and how hard it is to build audience trust. And if you’re a reader, remember that your favorite sites should treat you like you’re in a long-term relationship. They should invest in you, with accurate and engaging headlines that lead to quality journalism, good use of media and a friendly UX, rather than trying to trick you into giving a single, grudging click (the Internet’s equivalent of a one-night stand). As with any relationship, you shouldn’t settle.","Clickbaiting is the intentional act of over-promising or otherwise misrepresenting — in a headline, on social media, in an image, or some combination — what you’re going to find when you read a story on the web."

For the last seven decades, White has delighted audiences in sitcoms, commercials and films -- and she doesn't show any signs of slowing down. Now 93, the TV legend says she is thrilled to be able to continue working, which she understands is not a guarantee for someone at her age. ""When you're as blessed as I am with the good health I have, that's the bottom line,"" White tells Oprah in the above video. ""I never take it for granted. I appreciate it more than I can say."" Though the actress credits good genes as the main cause behind her strong health, White also cites a rather unusual exercise routine as another factor. ""I have a two-story house and a very bad memory,"" she says. ""So I'm up and down those stairs all the time!"" On a serious note, Oprah mentions that White never caved into the pressure of the rather common Hollywood practice of lying about her age. ""There was no need to,"" she says simply. ""What's the point of trying to fool anybody? Besides, my mother always said, 'Don't lie about your age. You'll forget and you'll slip up, and then you'll look ridiculous.'"" As the years went on, White's career began to evolve. Then, in 2010, a new generation of fans started to take notice. White had all but stolen the show opposite Sandra Bullock in ""The Proposal,"" had viewers falling out of their seats in a hilarious Super Bowl commercial and quickly found herself in the midst of a social media campaign to have her host ""Saturday Night Live."" Soon, the media began covering White's ""comeback,"" as they called it, dubbing her the Golden-Girl-turned-It-Girl of Hollywood. As grateful as White is to still be working, she admits that the ""comeback"" label is a little confusing. ""I don't know where the 'comeback' story came [from],"" White says. ""I've been working steadily for the last 70 years!"" Even now, with this incredible professional longevity, White says she never imagined her career lasting as long as it has. ""Who would ever dream that I would not only be this healthy, but still be invited to work?"" White says. ""That's the privilege...

1713,"Here’s how you can change your Pokemon Go team You definitely might have chosen a team in Pokemon Go by now and there is every possibility that you would want to change it in the future. However, the game doesn’t allow you to change your team once you pick it after reaching level 5. There might be a few cheats but all of them would result in losing your current game’s progress and stats. Thankfully, there seems to be a workaround to this as several users and Redditors have reported about successfully contacting Niantic in order to change their team even after choosing one after they reached level 5. Be warned though, Niantic will only accept your request for changing team once and you can’t keep changing them as you like. This is to ensure you want to change the team as you picked the wrong team by mistake. Another thing to note is that they will only accept your request if you’re low level and have not spent a lot of time with your chosen team. To change team, all you have to do is click this link . After clicking the link you will be redirected to the official website of Niantic, where you’ll be given an option to change your team for another one of your choice via a support form. You’ll just need to provide some minimal details like e-mail id, nickname, OS version etc in this process. Make sure to describe why you want to change your team in the ‘additional request tab’ and if you’ve followed the above, you might just well be able to choose a new team even after initially picking a different one. This process is tedious but worth the effort if you feel you’ve joined the wrong team by mistake. This might take a bit of time since many people are submitting requests.

1721,"Re your article (We need spaces to live but we also need places to make things, 7 January): twenty years ago Richard Rogers’ Towards an Urban Renaissance put sustainability at the core of a vision of compact cities where people worked, rested and played with minimum car use. Residential densification of central London and other large English cities would be delivered through regeneration and the judicious imposition of tall buildings. The result was a tall building frenzy driven by international capital, with many central London flats used as vacant safety deposit boxes. Meanwhile, a new population was sucked in to join Londoners who no longer wished to leave the thriving capital, and the housing crisis deepened. In desperation, successive mayors have identified over 40 ""opportunity areas"" for intensive housebuilding, involving a land grab of thousands of hectares. Unfortunately these are all key industrial areas where the nuts and bolts of the city are manufactured and many thousands of Londoners employed. For example, one company in the Vauxhall ""opportunity area"" – employing 100 ""low skill"" workers who live close by and work through the night preparing raw fish to supply many West End restaurants – is threatened with yet another tall speculative residential building. In the name of sustainability, we are building a city where ordinary people have nowhere to live and nowhere to work. Michael Ball Reclaim London While MPs and peers were away on their Christmas break the Resolution Foundation showed that half the UK population do not own their own homes, when properly counted. The housing crisis festered. Politicians return to parliament with no immediate plans to relieve those renters suffering now from overcrowding, debt, eviction, homelessness, hunger and ill health. That crisis has grown out of the 30 years’ total failure, both practical and moral, of the market to provide enough affordable homes to rent or to buy. 200,000 new homes in 14 new villages in an unreformed UK housing market will guarantee more and ever bigger housing crises. Recycling these announcements does not address the immediate crisis. The emergency response now required from government is to freeze all rent increases, prior to reintroducing rent controls, and to tax all unused land, like the 600,000 unused plots owned by the big builders.","""opportunity areas"" for intensive housebuilding, involving a land grab of thousands of hectares.

1722,"Yesterday we brought you a run-down of the story that everyone on the internet is talking about - the Australian man who punched a Kangaroo. We've been brought some new information on the trip, which we now gather was a hunt. The hunt was for a young cancer sufferer who wanted to fulfill a last wish of catching a 100 kilo boar with his dogs. One of the people on the trip, Greg Bloom, said: One day while hunting one of the highly trained dogs was chasing some pigs by scent and collided with a big buck kangaroo that then held and wrestled the dog by its protective gear (boars have tusks like knives), the owner was horrified that his dog or the kangaroo would get hurt and run in to save both parties. You can see the dog trying to escape, wanting nothing to do with the kangaroo. The big buck kangaroo releases the dog when the owner gets close but then moves in to try and attack the human. A kangaroo kick to the guts could easily disembowel the owner easily, so he backs off a couple of times giving the kangaroo some space but he eventually changes the 'roo's mind with a punch to the snout, as it kept coming forward.  Which is the bit that has been made famous. What did they make of the altercation? The punch stops the 'roo and makes him think about the situation, giving the owner and the dog time to disengage from the big wild animal and leaving it to hop off and I suppose wonder about what just happened. And what was the reaction? We laughed at the absurdity of the situation and at how unfortunate it was for the dog and kangaroo. Our six foot seven inch friend felt no malice to the kangaroo but had to step in and fix a bad situation before it got worse. How has the situation developed? Young Kailem unfortunately lost his brave battle with cancer two days ago, so this hunt is part of the treasured memories his family and friends have. Having a dog get tangled up with a 'roo was never our aim or intention and we were happy no animals were hurt in the incident.

So when his numbers start dropping, as they inevitably will Trump isn’t going to let himself lose in any official capacity, of course—that would go against everything the Trump brand stands for. So when his numbers start dropping, as they inevitably will and already have , Donald Trump is going to save face the best way he knows how: Quitting before it’s too late. Remember, Trump had a blast during the primaries. Back then, he was free to spew any sort of nonsense he wanted. And not only did no one question him too seriously, but as his discourse became increasingly unhinged and racist, his poll numbers rose in kind. The more his poll numbers shot up, the more media attention he got. And for Trump, there is no purer joy. If Donald Trump is able to buy his way into heaven, it’s just going to be him reliving the 2016 primaries every day for the rest of eternity. Now, though, the Democrats are just about done squabbling, Republicans are out of distractions, and the cold, sobering reality of what our nation has wrought is finally settling in. Now that the fun is winding down, the small-handed prince of our country’s most base anxieties is going to start looking for a way out. He’s already laying the groundwork, Now, though, the Democrats are just about done squabbling, Republicans are out of distractions, and the cold, sobering reality of what our nation has wrought is finally settling in. Now that the fun is winding down, the small-handed prince of our country’s most base anxieties is going to start looking for a way out. He’s already laying the groundwork, saying on Fox & Friends that ""it would be nice to have full support from people that are in office, full verbal support. With all of that being said, I may go a different route if things don’t happen."" Sponsored But what exactly is that different route going to look like? As I see it, Trump still has about four opportunities left to get out before it’s too late. Before the convention This is, perhaps, the easiest way out for Trump, especially since he’s already This is, perhaps, the easiest way out for Trump, especially since he’s already had some practice . Granted, during his most serious bid thus far in 2012, Trump was only ever half-running at best—and even then just for a few months. Still, it bore all the hallmarks of a classic (if unofficial) Trump campaign, complete with poll bravado and boasts of being a shoo-in Regarding his decision to pull out, Trump said (bolding ours): ...I have spent the past several months unofficially campaigning and recognize that running for public office cannot be done half-heartedly. Ultimately, however, business is my greatest passion and I am not ready to leave the private sector. Of course, back then Trump just didn’t want to abandon Celebrity Apprentice , Celebrity Apprentice is one of its most important programs, and the network would not be able to line up sponsorship commitments as easily with Mr. Trump as a ‘maybe.’"" Of course, back then Trump just didn’t want to abandonCelebrity Apprentice as The New York Times wrote just after Trump dropped out, ""[NBC] needed him to make a decision by Monday, when it was announcing its fall television schedule to major advertisers in its annual presentation in New York.Celebrity Apprenticeis one of its most important programs, and the network would not be able to line up sponsorship commitments as easily with Mr. Trump as a ‘maybe.’"" Now, though, NBC is out of the picture. Now, though, NBC is out of the picture. NBC cut ties with Trump about a year ago over his then-still-shocking racist tirades. Meaning that, this time, Trump would have to lean on his various hotels and business ventures if he wanted to pull another businessman-at-heart stunt. It’s a considerably less glamorous move than a reality show, sure, but still a solid enough out for Trump to at least claim he’s saving face. What’s more, if Trump gets out before the actual convention, he never actually runs the risk of party Republicans pulling the candidacy out from under him come Cleveland. So he gets to rail on about the fact that not only would he have done it better, he could have done it better, too—if he’d decided to accept the nomination, that is. He just didn’t want to. At the convention This is when it starts to get fun. Trump can’t make it all the way to the convention just to fizzle out with some lame announcement about wanting to focus on the business side of things. What’s more, if he gets all the way to the convention only to quietly bow out, he is going to be instantly upstaged by whoever the Republican party decides to put in his place. This is Donald Trump’s nightmare. Remember, absolutely everything Donald Trump does is about A) creating an appearance of having won and B) getting as much positive attention as humanly possible. To succeed in this scenario, Trump needs something huge to take everybody’s mind off the fact that he’s backing out of the presidency. Trump needs to announce Trump TV. Or the Trump News Network or Trump Broadcasting or Der Stürmer or whatever he decides to call it. This way, Trump gets to turn the Republican National Convention, where virtually every media outlet in the nation has gathered, into a press conference for the launch of his very own television network. , his whole campaign has basically been building to this point. His constant bashing of the media certainly must mean he thinks he can do it better. And to his credit, Trump does have a knack for commanding a national audience. Why bother being President, a job he neither wants nor is qualified for, when he can do the only part he actually enjoys (screaming things on television) for the rest of his life? And if he announces at the convention, he gets to allude to the fact that maybe this was really his plan the whole time . Everybody wins.

Which means that for this to work, he’s going to need to hit her where (he assumes) it hurts: He’s going to need to paint himself as the victim of Crooked Hillary’s cold, heartless power-hungry campaigning. Pinning his decision on his family would be the most viable option here. People generally get that. It allows him to say, ""Crooked Hillary’s dirty campaign keeps attacking my children."" Or, ""Melania can’t handle this."" Or ""my 10-year-old son, Barron, who I may or may not keep locked up in a basement because no one ever sees him, can’t handle this.""

Because no matter what happens, he will always be able to brag about the fact that not only could he have done it better, but the American people knew it, too. And now, he’ll never actually have a chance to fuck up and prove his naysayers right. After all, what does he care if he doesn’t actually fulfill all of his terrible promises?

1726,"NASA The enormous hole takes up much of the top half of the star The remarkable footage was captured by the US space agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory between May 17 and 19. The video shows a giant dark area on the star's upper half, known as a coronal hole. A NASA spokesman said: ""Coronal holes are low-density regions of the sun’s atmosphere, known as the corona. NASA It's massive: The footage was recorded between May 17 and 19 ""Because they contain little solar material, they have lower temperatures and thus appear much darker than their surroundings. ""Coronal holes are visible in certain types of extreme ultraviolet light, which is typically invisible to our eyes, but is colorised here in purple for easy viewing."" NASA says the huge hole is actually not of great concern, but it remains unclear why the coronal holes actually form. But it does mean that large amounts of solar winds, that cause the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights to form, have been blasted to Earth. While it’s unclear what causes coronal holes, they correlate to areas on the sun where magnetic fields soar up and away, without looping back down to the surface, as they do elsewhere. NASA spokesman These would weak havoc with our communications and blast us with cancer-causing UV rays, if it were not for the Earth's magnetosphere which shields us from them. The spokesman added: ""These coronal holes are important to understanding the space environment around Earth through which our technology and astronauts travel. ""Coronal holes are the source of a high-speed wind of solar particles that streams off the sun some three times faster than the slower wind elsewhere.

1728,"The offending meme. (Garlic Bread Memes) A war is brewing in memedom, and it could not possibly be more absurd: In the various online fan groups devoted to garlic bread, fierce arguments have broken out over ... gender. The drama first kicked off over the weekend, when the wildly popular Facebook page Garlic Bread Memes posted an image macro that many have interpreted as transphobic. (How popular could the page possibly be, you ask? Well, more than a quarter-million people currently subscribe to it.) The meme depicted two pieces of garlic bread with the caption ""if I had a slice of garlic bread for every existing gender."" [A woman came up with this clever meme. Men quickly pretended the idea was theirs.] The implication, many readers assumed, is that the page’s administrators rejected gender identities beside male and female. And that promptly ignited hundreds of outraged posts in the comments, as well as on Reddit and Instagram, where the meme is similarly well-followed. Critics were aghast that a slice of bread would take such a position. ""I am surprised by the scale of the reaction,"" said the Garlic Bread Memes’ main administrator, who identified himself as an 18-year-old Israeli high-schooler named Boaz. ""But [I’m not surprised] about the reaction itself."" Before we get any further into the drama, we should probably take a baby step back and survey what it is that we’re actually talking about. Offline, garlic bread is a food — okay, sure. But online it’s sort of like that juvenile joke where you append the phrase ""in bed"" to your fortune cookies. It doesn’t stand alone, really — it’s an addendum to existing memes, a means of making any prior messages absurd and thus, funny. The absurdity is an end in itself: It’s not necessarily an attempt to communicate any broader point or commentary, unless you’d call it a parody of meme culture in general. [Meme librarian is a real job — and it’s the best one on the Internet] In other words, people who follow Garlic Bread Memes — whether on Facebook (265,000 subscribers) , Reddit (11,000) or Instagram (10,500) — find it funny because it makes fun of memes that exist already. In the case of this latest and very infamous garlic bread meme, the original source was an explicitly transphobic image macro that makes regular appearances in places like 4chan and r/The_Donald, Reddit’s dedicated Trump fan club. Usually it reads something along the lines of ""if I had a dollar for every gender, I’d have two dollars,"" or ""if I had a book for every gender there was, I’d have have Donald Trump’s ""Think Like a Champion"" and ""The Art of the Deal."" Boaz says he was specifically inspired by a less-than-tasteful iteration that reads ""If I had an atomic bomb for every gender there was"" next to a map of the 1945 bomb strikes in Japan. These memes are intended to perpetuate a discriminatory narrative about trans people, and there are a whole lot of reasons why a trans person or ally who saw them might find that narrative deeply offensive. (If that baffles you, I recommend a quick refresher on what, exactly, gender identity is.) Similarly, a trans person or ally who encountered the garlic bread version — and who was not familiar with exactly what the garlic bread meme traditionally means — would be totally justified in feeling, as one commenter put it, that the creator was ""a transphobic a–hole"" whose ignorance ""is destroying the very fabric of society."" But remember that garlic bread memes are intended to make absurdities of the originals they depict, which means that Boaz was basically mocking a transphobic meme with his breadier version. At the same time, he expected it to offend ""social justice warriors,"" a derogatory name for people who speak out on progressive issues. So Boaz was, essentially trolling everyone involved in the online gender debate. He wasn’t mocking trans people, Boaz told Intersect: He was mocking the extremes of the online conversation that happens around them. Maybe that’s a distinction that doesn’t mean much to you. Certainly Boaz is no beacon of LGBT acceptance. He maintains, as far as the Intersect can tell, your average high-schooler’s understanding of sex and gender (which is to say, not much) and he’s pretty critical of ""social justice warriors."" We’re certainly not celebrating his garlic bread meme, which — whatever its original intentions — has been widely interpreted and shared as a nasty criticism of trans people. And we’d also dispute his claim that the nature of sex and gender is a matter of ""opinion."" But we will say that, insofar as the meme was originally intended to mock the state of online dialogue, it definitely worked. Just look at any of the more than 2,000 comments that have been left on the macro: People on both sides — particularly the anti-trans side, who seem responsible for virtually all of the comments — are going absolutely berserk. They’re calling names; typing in all caps; launching into lengthy diatribes that misquote the scientific literature. Any commenter who questions the gender binary is promptly slapped with a hail of f-bombs and ad-hominems. Boaz would argue that’s exactly the joke: Online outrage culture has blown up so much, he says, that it needed garlic-breading to make evident just how extreme it had grown. Of course, in an ironic turn of events, the garlic bread became an object of outrage itself. ... All of which leaves us with a vague sense of despair and a desire to never again eat garlic bread again. Liked that? Try these!","In the case of this latest and very infamous garlic bread meme, the original source was an explicitly transphobic image macro that makes regular appearances in places like 4chan and r/The_Donald, Reddit’s dedicated Trump fan club.

1738,"Think the Grand Canyon is big? British scientists working in West Antarctica have discovered a subglacial trench that's deeper than Arizona's famed canyon. Whoa. The scientists found the colossal trough while charting the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, an ancient subglacial mountain range in the area, and detailed the discovery in a paper published in the January issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin. ""The discovery of this huge trough, and the characterization of the surrounding mountainous landscape, was incredibly serendipitous,"" the paper's lead author, Dr. Neil Ross, a physical geography lecturer at Newcastle University in the U.K., said in a written statement. ""To me, this just goes to demonstrate how little we still know about the surface of our own planet. The discovery and exploration of hidden, previously unknown landscapes is still possible and incredibly exciting, even now."" Dubbed Ellsworth Trough, the trench was created tens of million years ago by a small, ""dynamic"" ice field that slowly carved out the dramatic formations now hidden beneath a layer of ice more than a mile thick. With the help of ice-penetrating radar, the scientists found the trough to be more than 186 miles long, up to 15 miles across and, in some places, 1.8 miles deep, according to a written statement released by Bristol University. The Grand Canyon has an average depth of about 1 mile and maximum width of 17.9 miles. The Ellsworth Trough is so large, it can be seen from space -- yes, even beneath all of that ice. As Gizmodo reported, NASA helped researchers map the trough by sharing satellite imagery that provided a big-picture view of the subglacial canyon. ""By looking at the topography beneath the ice sheet using a combination of ice-penetrating radio-echo sounding and satellite imagery, we have revealed a region which possesses classic glacial geomorphic landforms, such as u-shaped valleys and cirques, that could only have been formed by a small ice cap, similar to those seen at present in the Canadian and Russian High Arctic,"" Dr. Martin Siegert, a member of the research team and professor of geosciences at the University of Bristol in the U.K., said in the written statement.

1747,"With 10 or so weeks to go until Election Day, the most common measure of just how far ahead Hillary Clinton is in the presidential race is where her campaign is spending less money. Clinton’s campaign has (at least for the moment) stopped spending money to put ads on the air in Colorado and Virginia. (In both states, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages, Clinton is ahead of Trump by an average of 11 points.) The pro-Clinton Super PAC Priorities USA is ""going dark"" for a month in those two states and in Pennsylvania (where Clinton is polling about 9 points ahead of Trump). On the surface, this looks like an act of confidence — if not outright complacency. But that’s not the whole story. The Hillary Clinton campaign might be pulling its ad buys out of conventional swing states like Colorado and Virginia, but that’s because it’s putting effort into unexpected places. Since the conventions, the Hillary Clinton campaign has expanded its operations in Arizona and put full-time staff into Georgia, a state that few could have imagined Democrats would compete in come 2016. It’s a strategy that Democrats refer to as ""expanding the map"": taking the opportunity presented by a flailing Trump campaign to turn swing states blue, and to compete in parts of the country where Democrats haven’t been able to compete before. It seems obvious enough: Donald Trump appears to be steering Republicans toward an unusually bad year, so Democrats should capitalize on his failure. They have an opportunity in North Carolina, where Clinton is up on Trump by 2 points, according to RealClearPolitics.Trump and Clinton are effectively tied in Arizona and Georgia. Even South Carolina could be in play: The only poll conducted there in 2016 has Trump winning by only 2 points. But which of those states do Democrats aim to turn blue, and how? That actually opens up huge questions about the nature of the party itself — for 2016 and beyond. Do they take the opportunity to consolidate progressive power and move America to the left, or try to siphon off all the disaffected Republicans out there turned off by Trump’s bombast? Some voices within the party have long argued they already have a majority; they just need to mobilize it. In 2016, they’re finally getting the resources to put that theory into practice. If Clinton can win the state of Georgia — or even come close — it will vindicate a theory that some progressives of color have long championed: that progressives already have a majority and they just need to get the people who make it up to the polls. Ultimately, though, whether the Democratic Party wants to appeal to low-propensity voters of color in Georgia or anti-Trump moderates in Iowa is going to depend on who the Democratic Party wants to be. Thinking outside of traditional ways campaigns spend money Campaign strategy is just a fancy word for arithmetic. Whether you’re talking about winning a state’s electoral votes in a presidential election, or winning a Senate or congressional seat, the goal of a campaign is the same: Make sure the majority (or plurality) of votes that get cast in November are cast for your party’s candidate. The traditional way to go about this — and, in a lot of ways, the easiest — is to assume that the number of people who will probably vote in the election is already set and the question is who they’ll vote for. It’s so traditional, in fact, that it’s easy to think about it as the only way to go about winning an election. But it’s not. It actually carries very particular implications: that political parties should be big tents, extremely solicitous of moderate voters. So the traditional strategy is a persuasion strategy. It involves targeting people who vote on a regular basis — even if they don’t always vote for your party. It involves choosing candidates and platforms that come as close to the median of the electorate — including the undecided middle — as possible. This is especially true for Senate and congressional campaigns, where a lot of the work is simply recruiting a candidate who, in the words of National Press Secretary Meredith Kelly of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ""fits the district."" And it involves spending money on ads, trying to get voters to see the other party as bad, and your party as good. This is the basic swing state playbook. It’s an easy one for congressional committees and PACs to follow: It’s easy to raise money centrally and disperse it, and equally easy to pull ads from parts of the country that aren’t looking competitive and push them into parts that are. In 2016, that means that some traditional swing states — like Virginia, where Clinton is already up by an average of 10 points — don’t look like good investments. And some relatively unexpected states and districts are. The mobilization opportunity: Democrats could turn Arizona and Georgia blue by mobilizing voters of color But what if Democrats stopped thinking about winning as many of the available, likely voters as possible, and started thinking about changing the pool of who was a likely voter? What if they focused less on persuasion and more on voter mobilization? This is an argument that progressives of color within the Democratic Party, led by strategist Steve Phillips — whose book Brown Is the New White is something of a manifesto — have been making for several years. ""We spend a lot of money, and a lot of time, trying to persuade atheists to become Catholics,"" says Stacey Abrams, the minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives. ""What we have to do is get Baptists to go to church."" The way they see it, there’s a natural progressive majority in the US, driven by nonwhite citizens. It’s just that many of those citizens don’t vote in midterm elections, or don’t vote at all. If Democrats stop pivoting to the center and spending money on ads, and start focusing on getting their natural allies to the polls, they can win more durable victories; America, after all, is only getting more diverse. ""We’ve already won,"" says Abrams — ""we just forgot to pick up our prize."" The strategy that Phillips, Abrams, and company call the ""new American majority"" strategy represents a totally different version of ""expanding the map."" It expands it to places where rapid demographic change creates opportunities for Democrats: states like Arizona, Texas, and Georgia. Instead of spending money on ads, it encourages Democrats to spend it on turnout. Phillips estimates that for the amount of money spent on attack ads in the 2014 North Carolina Senate race, for example, Democrats could have paid for ""400 full-time staff members to go door to door in communities of color for an entire year, talking to and mobilizing the voters who had turned out for [Democratic Sen. Kay] Hagan when she won in 2008."" Democrats haven’t traditionally invested in turning out nonvoters in states like Georgia Stacey Abrams sees Georgia as ""emblematic of a number of states, particularly Southern states,"" where Democratic voters have simply never gotten the attention that their peers in swing states get every two to four years. For 130 years, the state was deep blue (thanks to a coalition of Dixiecrats and progressives) and there was no need to get out the vote; then, ""when that all fell apart in the 2000s and we lost power,"" there was no interest in spending money to turn out Democrats in a deep red state. As a result, Abrams points out, there are hundreds of thousands of Georgia residents who are simply assumed not to be voters. ""It becomes this vicious self-fulfilling prophecy: They don’t vote because no one asks, and because no one asks, they don’t vote."" Georgia’s demographics are changing: It’s on track to be majority minority by 2030, if not before. If those nonwhite voters can be mobilized, and if they’re as consistently progressive as their voting peers — as Abrams argues they are — they could turn the state blue for good. But demographics aren’t destiny — a lesson that Democrats have learned painfully. There’s a cohort of nonwhite voters, Abrams says, who have ""traditionally not engaged at all — when they vote, it’s because they have traditionally self-organized."" As Democrats have seen, that isn’t enough. In 2014, for example, Democrats lost a painful Senate race in Colorado, in part due to low turnout among Latino voters. Polling conducted by the firm Latino Decisions showed that more than 40 percent of Latinos who voted in the election had never been contacted by any party or organization about voting or registering. Only a third of Latino voters in Colorado had been contacted by Democrats — despite the Colorado Senate race being one of Democrats’ highest priorities that year, and despite Latinos having been a key constituency in Democratic victories in the state over the past three cycles. In 2016, Democrats may finally be investing in expanding the map by expanding the electorate In 2014, Abrams tried to prove her theory by launching a pilot voter mobilization effort. In six months, her 501(c)3 organization got 64,000 people of color on the voter rolls — a solid chunk of the 800,000 unregistered citizens of color in the state. Then there was the effort (coordinated through a separate, 501(c)4 organization) to mobilize those voters — as well as people who were already registered, but didn’t even turn out to vote in every presidential election, much less in midterms. She found that a simple phone call or mailer could boost turnout by 9 percentage points. A mailer plus a phone call (or a visit) boosted it 12 points. And ""if they received a full cohort and complement, the way you treat swing voters in any other state, their turnout jumped to 71 percent."" Initially, Abrams struggled to persuade Democrats outside of Georgia that her state was a worthwhile investment. But all of a sudden, in 2016, the state is beginning to look eminently winnable. FiveThirtyEight’s ""polls-only"" model projects Clinton could win the state — and that’s based on a polling model that assumes the electorate will look similar to 2008 and 2012, which doesn’t factor in the work Abrams and her team have been doing. And the Democratic establishment is taking notice. Clinton’s decision to open an office in Georgia is a strong vote of confidence. More broadly, organizations that have typically put their money toward a ""persuasion"" strategy are starting to put resources toward mobilization. Priorities USA, for example, is redirecting its money toward voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts, including helping Hispanic voter mobilization groups in Colorado, Nevada, and Florida. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is already putting effort into voter turnout, something it doesn’t traditionally focus on until closer to Election Day. The persuasion opportunity: Trump could help Democrats compete in suburban Minnesota, Iowa, and Indiana That isn’t to say that Democrats aren’t taking opportunities to persuade voters where they can — or that they aren’t, in their own way, expanding the map by doing so. Meredith Kelly of the DCCC talks about some districts where Trump is ""toxic."" She points to Florida’s 7th District, in the suburbs of Orlando. ""It’s very diverse — it’s urban and suburban, it’s very affluent and well-educated compared to the rest of the state — so that is exactly the type of district that we are looking to compete in this year."" The DCCC would have competed there anyway, she hastens to point out, but Trump ""has accelerated that."" These are districts where people might be tempted to vote Republican in other cycles — and, indeed, probably voted for the incumbent in 2010 or 2014 — but where the Trump brand might make them take another look at the Democratic Party. ""I think you’ll see,"" predicts Lauren Passalacqua of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, ""a lot of people who have been a part of the Republican Party wondering if it’s still the right place for them."" As much as anything, though, the opportunities that Trump has provided on the House level haven’t been with voters but with Democratic candidates — people who ""fit their districts"" but are only now willing to run. Minnesota’s Third District, located in suburban Minneapolis, is the kind of example Democrats are targeting: Candidate Terri Bonoff is what Kelly describes as ""our ideal recruit for that district."" The district is ""socially moderate and economically conservative,"" and Bonoff is too. (Kelly describes her as ""independent-minded"" — which is to say she may win the seat for Democrats but she may not always vote with party leadership.) But in previous years, Bonoff resisted running against incumbent Rep. Erik Paulsen; this year, she’s in. Then there are the races in Iowa and Indiana, and ""emerging"" races in Michigan. The most optimistic Hillary Clinton campaign staffers I’ve talked to have floated the possibility of competing even in Kansas. These definitely aren’t swing states in the way you traditionally think of them. But they’re based on a similar logic to the logic of swing states: that Democrats need to persuade as many voters as possible to vote for them this year. Putting money toward expanding the map isn’t the same as investing in new areas of the country After all, investing in voter turnout instead of ads is not a foolproof strategy. If it were, Texas would have turned blue several years ago. Texas is the elephant in the room for the ""expanding the map"" strategy. It demographically more fertile ground for Democrats than Georgia, and Democratic groups have put millions of dollars over the past several years into voter registration efforts to turn Texas blue. Not only has it not worked in the past, but it certainly appears that Texas is going to stay red in 2016, even as Georgia — and maybe even South Carolina — turn purple. ""I think it’s a cautionary tale,"" Stacey Abrams says of Texas. She’s learned a few specific lessons for Georgia: that you can’t parachute staffers from one part of the state into another part and expect them to connect with voters, for example. (Florida represents a similar cautionary tale in this regard: Democrats I’ve talked to are often frustrated that candidates in Florida don’t understand that they have to do different things to reach out to Puerto Rican voters in central Florida and Venezuelan voters in Miami.) But the other lesson of Texas is that voter mobilization is a long-term process. Arguably, Texas wouldn’t have looked like as much of a failure in 2014 for Democrats if they hadn’t gotten excited about Wendy Davis’s gubernatorial candidacy, turning what was originally supposed to be a long-term voter mobilization effort into a short-term one with inflated expectations. Organizations will need to stick around after Election Day to maintain infrastructure in states and districts — something that national PACs and congressional committees aren’t interested in or well-equipped to do. Furthermore, despite the argument of the ""new American majority"" theory that it might be easier to elect progressive Democrats than moderate ones, the electorate doesn’t always change enough in a single cycle to allow a red district to suddenly turn deep blue. In Arizona, for example, Democrats got a new congressional district in 2010 thanks to the growth of the Latino vote in the state — but it’s currently represented by Kyrsten Sinema, one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress. She fits her district, and her district is not yet blue. Democrats will need to keep voters engaged beyond 2016 — which means they’ll have to decide what kind of party they’ll want to be The biggest problem with using a ""new American majority"" strategy in down-ballot races is redistricting: Republican state legislatures work hard to draw districts that won’t get diverse enough to elect Democrats instead of Republicans. Democrats are aware of how crucial it is to reverse their slide in state legislative races by 2020, so they have control of the redistricting process in key states. National groups are already holding informal discussions to figure out how they’ll build infrastructure over the next four years; outside groups are trying to mount a campaign similar to the one Republicans used to take over state houses in 2010. But in 2020, Donald Trump is unlikely to be the Republican nominee for president again. That’s not a natural advantage Democrats will have. Sure, Democrats can make an effort to govern from the center and give moderates fewer reasons to leave — but ultimately, the choice facing moderates in 2020 is going to depend on what the Republican Party wants to be. ""Looking ahead, what are the impacts of what this campaign season has been about?"" asks Passalacqua of the DSCC. ""I’m not sure we know the answer to that yet, or will, even on or after Election Day."" And while Democrats generally have a demographic advantage in presidential election years, the danger of a strategy that relies on low-propensity voters instead of affluent moderates is that, well, low-propensity voters are less likely to turn out to vote. The point of the ""expanding the map"" strategy is to build political power for Democrats in ways the status quo hasn’t necessarily succeeded at doing. Thanks in part to the voter registration and mobilization efforts of Abrams’s groups, Georgia Democrats won four state legislative races in 2014, in a year that was bad for Democrats across the board. Long-term map expansion is going to require that kind of victory, not just a series of wave elections in which Democrats win at all levels in years divisible by four and Republicans win at all levels in every midterm. For Abrams, this isn’t a hard problem to solve. It goes back to her analogy about atheists and Baptists. ""As the daughter of ministers, I will tell you that if you only get people to come to church on Christmas, you’re not converting them. What you’re doing is guilting them, you’re shaming them into action,"" she says. ""What you have to be able to do is build the evangelism that says this is a constant thing. You need to be in church, in the pews, every Sunday."" Abrams boasts that Georgia Democrats have become a ""year-round party"" by focusing on progressive issues — the issues that people of color in her state care about. ""It’s a dangerous thing for a politician to say, but you shouldn’t vote for me,"" she says. ""I’m asking you to vote for the issues that you believe in, I just happen to be your conduit."" Whether Democrats can make that work in Georgia in the long run — or in Arizona and North Carolina, or in Iowa and Indiana — depends on which voters they’re saying that to, and which issues they want to be a conduit for. If Democrats spend four years of a Clinton presidency trying to reach out equally to the ""new American majority"" and to the moderates who think Trump is ""toxic"" but might not think other Republicans are, will either of them really be part of the congregation? The bad map we see every presidential election","It’s a strategy that Democrats refer to as ""expanding the map"": taking the opportunity presented by a flailing Trump campaign to turn swing states blue, and to compete in parts of the country where Democrats haven’t been able to compete before."

Kate Taylor The biggest trend in the coffee industry is going gourmet — but a new investigation reveals that may not be what most customers want. Gefällt mir 0 Teilen 0 On Monday, Today released a video from its series ""Don't Pay That,"" documenting a multi-hour blind taste test Jeff Rossen conducted in New Jersey's Menlo Park Mall. The two competitors in the taste test: $1 deli coffee versus a $3.25 gourmet option. In the end, 67% of people surveyed preferred the $1 option — not the coffee that cost three times as much. The fact that most testers prefer the less expensive coffee stands in contrast to recent decisions at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts to focus on more gourmet offerings. Dunkin' Donuts added Cold Brew to the menu in June. Dunkin Both chains have emphasized new, more upscale menu items this summer, with executives at both companies citing America's growing interest in coffee culture as a major impact.

1753,"Eggs, like some other foods, have gotten a bit of a bad rap over the years, with numerous findings reporting that eggs can be chiefly responsible for high levels of cholesterol. However, the truth of the matter is altogether different. In fact, not only is the cholesterol statement erroneous, eggs actually have many varied — and essential — benefits for your body. Because the average large egg contains between 180 and 186 milligrams of cholesterol, just one immediately counts for over half of your recommended daily intake, the Huffington Post reports. However, it's a little more complicated than that: It turns out cholesterol is actually already being produced, in rather significant amounts, by your body – 1 to 2 grams each day on average. But when you consume foods that contain cholesterol, your body's production of the substance decreases to make up for it. You don't really add cholesterol to existing amounts, you're replacing one kind with another. Authority Nutrition makes another excellent point: While cholesterol has negative connotations for obvious reasons, it is not a purely harmful molecule. Cholesterol is a vital part of the body, and is essential in creating testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. The website also reports a study where a group of individuals took to eating one to three whole eggs a day. For 70 percent of those people, eggs did not negatively affect cholesterol levels. For the remaining 30 percent, the issue was fairly benign as well: Eggs were found to change LDL cholesterol (the harmful variety) from small, dense molecules to larger ones, which made them a lot less of a threat. One damper on the good news, however: Eggs are found to cause an increased risk of heart disease in diabetics, Authority Nutrition says. Now that we've dispelled most of the negative preconceptions about eggs, let's explore the advantages to their regular consumption: 1. Nutrients Eggs are rich in several different types of nutrients, according to the Huffington Post: They're rich in vitamins A, D, E and B-12, as well as iron, folate, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, among others, all of which are extremely important. 2. Protein According to According to Health 24 , eggs provide the highest-quality protein, with a much higher rating than milk or beef. You'd need about 30 grams of meat to equate to a single egg, which is much less expensive. 3. Choline Choline, a nutrient you don't frequently hear about, is nonetheless very important for the brain. It helps promote growth and memory function, Health 24 says. Choline supplements are especially crucial for pregnant mothers, where most of the woman's choline supplies will be sent to her child and she will be left with a critically low amount. Authority Nutrition goes so far as to say 90 percent of people are lacking in choline. Eggs contain plenty of this nutrient. 4. Eyesight The Huffington Post says eggs are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that gather in the eye region and protect your eyes from dangerous light wavelengths, as well as lower the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts. 5. Weight control Eggs help with satiety, meaning they make you feel fuller than many other foods. Health 24 reports people who start the day with some eggs in their breakfast feel much less hungry throughout the day, which allows them to take smaller meals. 6. Bones, hair and nails The vitamin D and calcium mentioned previously are of great importance for the bones, helping them grow stronger. Eggs help prevent osteoporosis this way, according to Health 24. In addition, the amino acids and minerals in eggs promote healthier hair and nails, the website says. So should you eat three eggs a day? Authority Nutrition recommends it, saying the benefits are much stronger than the downsides. But ""Today"" reports such an intake in eggs can lead to carotid plaque buildup in the arteries, as well as an increased risk in heart attack and stroke due to the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, a somewhat harmful chemical. The Huffington Post suggests varying up your diet a bit, stating three eggs a day can be a bit much. However, there's clearly no reason not to enjoy more than one of these a day – especially if you prefer free-range eggs to the supermarket variety, which has been found to provide a lot less nutrients.",eggs actually have many varied — and essential — benefits for your body

The game is definitely a good one to play, but one thing that has troubled the players is its battery consumption. The game has been accused of draining a whole lot of phone battery. The main reason of the game’s enormous battery consumption, according to CyberShack, is its use of GPS and the rear facing camera. Developer Niantic, however, stated in the game’s official page that the battery issue is known to them. They wrote: Heavy battery use Some devices may experience battery drain while playing Pokémon GOfor prolonged periods of time. We are working on a solution. Some tips to conserve the battery life while using the game is by adjusting screen brightness, reducing in-game actions, and turning off the sound.

1757,"""The 1950s called, they want their onesie back""  A dad has shared a photo of a belittling babygrow that instructs men on how to dress their baby. Welcome to the 21st century, a time when genders have never been more equal - until it comes to stereotypical views on parenting that is. If you’ve shopped for kids clothes any time recently, you’ve probably noticed the kind of slogans this dad is talking about, and men aren’t happy about it. Posting in the ‘Daddit’ community of Reddit, one father shared a photo of a onesie that had the words ""This shirt is daddy-proof"" emblazoned across it as well as arrows pointing to where the baby’s arms and head should go.  Unsurprisingly, it didn’t go down well. ""The 1950s called, they want their onesie back,"" one person wrote. Another added, ""This is so patronising. How did this actually reach the shelves in whatever shop it is?"" While some were just plain confused. ""Instructions unclear. Where do the legs go?"" Of course, this kind of thing is easy to laugh off but sexist attitudes towards dads are a very real problem. Why are we constantly told that men are less competent parents than women? With that in mind, some dads used the post as an opportunity to share prejudiced things that happened to them while they were looking after their children alone. ""I took my kids to the aquarium while my wife was out of town and received tonnes of comments about ‘Where’s mum?’ and ‘You have your hands full’, one dad wrote. Someone else added, ""Some nosy mum decided to comment on how my daughters clothes didn’t match and her braid didn’t look like ‘a good mum would do.’"" ""Stay-at-home dad here from the UK and I’ve had ‘you’re babysitting’ comments a lot more than I was expecting in the year I’ve been at home,"" said another.

1764,"Pokémon Go Has A Feature That Nobody Knows How To Use So, for those who have been living somewhere under a rock in the middle of the Carribean sea, Pokemon Go came out last week and lots of people are playing it. It’s been a huge hit, and people all over the world are currently enjoying catching Pokemon out in the real world. The game isn’t overly complex, but then again, neither are its functions explained in great detail. One function in particular has been niggling at players, causing quite a great deal of annoyance. Problem is, it’s one of the games most used features to boot. The ""Nearby"" function is theoretically supposed to show you the variety of Pokemon in the area that you’re in, and your distance from each of them. Unless previously caught, only the silhouette of the Pokemon is shown (usually easily guessable however). The distance is represented by pawprints – the greater the number, the further away the Pokemon is. Now, you would think this feature would typically be one of, if the not the most, used while playing the game. The main point of being a Pokemon trainer is to ""catch ‘em all"", after all. However, the feature developer Niantic have currently supplied players with is pretty......well, shit. There’s no accurate distance to be figured out of from the pawprints. Some people claim that a single pawprint indicates around 50 metres. Then again, the go-to Pokemon factoid site Serebii says that one pawprint actually indicates 20 metres . In that case, two pawprints is 40 metres, and three represent 60 metres? No. According to Serebii, two pawprints are 100 metres, and three means 1000 metres, or 1 kilometre. Right. Totally logical. Even being on right on top of a Pokemon (no pawprints) induces a frantic, random search that involves far more work than it should do. If my phone tells me a Pikachu is so close to me I could smell it Poke-fart, I shouldn’t have to spend 20 minutes climbing on top of bins and scrambling under cars for it to grace me with its presence. Some people think they have a formula nailed down. Redditor TheColourlessPill came up with a formula (shown in the photo below, kindly done by Redditor DJ Toaster) that they think helps narrow down catching those wily Poke-buggers. It’s quite convoluted, and does require at least University level Geography skills, but for now, it might be the best way we have to track down the more elusive targets on our list. Now, the game has just released, and with its wild popularity, Niantic probably have their hands full just keeping the servers working (especially with people constantly fluking the GPS system to appear in place they’re not ). They’ve undoubtedly received a lot of feedback that will be getting sifted through now right now in order to improve the game and make it more enjoyable for everyone playing. My own suggestion would be to add a simple, accurate distance to those pawprints. A directional indicator would be handy – maybe an item on the store could be introduced to show the direction of Pokemon from your location, in tandem with the ""Nearby"" indicator. Niantic may not want to do that, as it could reduce the challenge of the game significantly. At the very minimum however, if we could just figure out how far away we are from something, we can much more easily search for it. This would help reduce the marathon inducing hunting parties down to merely being annoyed while finding a Pokemon hiding nearby. That’s my suggestion, for what it’s worth. As to what Niantic decide to actually do, we’ll probably find out soon enough. They plan to introduce a bi-weekly update schedule, so give it another couple weeks, and we’ll see what kind of tweaks and fixes they’ll have in store.","The ""Nearby"" function is theoretically supposed to show you the variety of Pokemon in the area that you’re in, and your distance from each of them.

1774,"Think on this: What happens to the typical man with a PhD in science after his wife has their first child? Are his opportunities affected by the status of his home life or gender? Now this: What happens to the typical woman with a PhD in science after she has her first child? Or her second? How do her (mostly male) peers react? Is she allowed extended maternity leave? Flex time? Breast-pumping breaks and days off for comforting sick kids? Is she considered equally in applications for higher-paying jobs and promotions? What if she takes a year or two off—is the gap on her resume counted as experience, or a strike against her? If she applies for a research grant, will she get it? Today, February 11, is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. This is the first such commemorative day dedicated to asking these questions and coming up with solutions to a problem that affects communities from the wealthiest, most urbane settings to the poorest corners of the globe. In place after place, women and girls are lagging behind their male counterparts in the sciences. A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science. A Global Problem Worldwide, women account for just 28 percent of all researchers. Even though enrollment numbers are up and more women are studying science, they’re not matching their male counterparts with PhDs and jobs with critical decision-making clout. And we cannot assume the status quo will gradually change over time as more of those women graduate with degrees in science, technology and engineering. ""Gaps and barriers persist throughout the scientific research system,"" notes a flagship UNESCO science report on this issue titled, Towards 2030. Even in Europe and the United States, the numbers of women in positions of ""leadership and prestige"" remain stagnant despite a decade-long push for change. ""Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left,"" the report says. Reasons cited include a host of cultural phenomena: the maternal wall or glass ceiling, lack of recognition and support for women in leadership, and bias—both conscious and subconscious. The latter is particularly pernicious and difficult to change. ""Science remains one of the few sectors where gender bias is common and considered acceptable by some,"" according to UNESCO. There is a persistent underlying belief that women simply cannot do science as well as men—or that they are overly emotional and distracting to men. When women are missing from classrooms and research labs, they are less likely to be invited to research councils, think tanks, and the editorial boards of scholarly journals. They will not move up to political forums and roundtables of global policymaking. The UN decided to set aside one day—Feb. 11—each year to promote women in science because it is critical to the future of humanity, and this planet. This is not just about do-good, feel-good morality goals; it’s about health and prosperity, life and death. In countries where women and girls are denied education, child and maternal death rates are higher. But when women are educated and included in decision-making circles—in the family, the village, the country—economies grow and mortality rates decline. Take, for example, climate change. As a whole, women suffer the effects of climate change more than men. ""Since men tend to enjoy a higher socio-economic status, women are disproportionately affected by droughts, floods and other extreme weather events and marginalized when it comes to making decisions on recovery and adaptation,"" according to UNESCO. Yet not nearly as many women as men work in scientific fields involving climate change adaptation strategies. Not nearly as many women as men have decision-making powers—at home or in the community—to determine the best strategies for family and cultural survival. Participants at last December’s COP21 talks in Paris noted a striking gender imbalance, ""detrimental to taking action to save people from the ravages of climate change."" Think, for a moment, about daily life in a traditionally patriarchal society. Let’s say you’re a girl in a remote village, somewhere up a mountain in Timor-Leste. You quit school at third or fourth grade because your mother needs your help in the kitchen and field. You marry young, leave your parents, and move into your husband’s home. His family pays a bride price for you, and by your culture’s standards, you essentially belong to him. You are ""not independent to speak,"" says Rosaria Martins da Cruz, director of HIAM Health, an NGO that fights malnutrition among mothers and kids. Your husband doesn’t want you to get a job, so you don’t. You have no income of your own. You spend your days in the confines of your hut and your land—caring for kids, tending livestock, weeding the garden. As a rural woman, you are ""always in the home to look after the baby, cooking for the man, clean the house, do everything for the man and the kids,"" da Cruz says. Now let’s say it’s an El Niño year (like this one). The rains are late, and drought is expected. Your crops are dying, and people say it’s going to get worse with climate change. You’ve spent the money from last year’s harvest. There is only a little rice to eat, with a few chiles and greens. You feed your husband first. You feed your baby a mush of bland white rice, nothing else. You eat the last dregs yourself, after the others have finished—because that’s tradition, that’s your place in the family. You know it’s not enough nourishment for any of you. You know you’re all getting weaker. You go to church, you pray for rain. When it doesn’t come, sickness does. The neighbor’s baby dies. Then the old woman up the road does, too. You attend each funeral, and go to bed wishing you had the knowledge to make things better, wishing you knew where to begin. The next morning, you wake before dawn to fetch the water, you light the fire, and your daily routine repeats. This is what it’s like for millions of rural women worldwide who are neither asked nor granted the opportunity to study, to leave the village, to learn and then return to make things better. When women are excluded from education and the pursuit of dreams, their communities are denied 50 percent of all opportunity to innovate and grow. For many women around the globe, their gender presents a double burden: they are born into the lowest rungs of society, and their culture keeps them there with little chance to advance. This is something we all must work to change, in our homes and our communities—from Timor-Leste to the United States and beyond. We need Feb. 11 as a start to promote women and girls in science. But even more, we need women and girls in science every day, all year long. Reporting from Timor-Leste was supported by a fellowship through the International Reporting Project. Discussion comments...",A quick look at the stats shows why the international community so urgently needs to do a better job of promoting women in science.
1776,"An attempt to take a selfie on the railway tracks cost a 22-year-old his life near Dhuri Lines on Wednes day. Government Railway Police (GRP) identified the victim as Gaurav Sahni, a resident of Hai bowal Kalan and owner of a restaurant on Hambran Road. Gaurav, along with his friends Piyush and Saurav Garg, had gone to Dhuri Lines to see a property in the evening. Once there, he asked his friends to wait for him at a nearby restaurant, while he checked the property with a realtor. Later, he called up his friends to pick him up. ""I reached there on a two-wheeler to pick up Gaurav and saw him lying on the railway tracks. I requested those present there to help us, but no one came forward,"" said Saurav. He said people there told him that Gaurav had walked towards the railway tracks to click pictures with a train in the background.A passenger train hit him while he was clicking selfies around 6.21pm. ""Gaurav was fond of uploading his pictures on social networking sites,"" he added. ""I called up ambulance helpline 108 and was asked to register my request. I called up again after 10 minutes, but the driver said the request was not registered as I'd not given my name. I then took a hawker's cart and rushed Gaurav to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. I had even called up police helpline 100, but no one took the call,"" said Saurav. GRP SHO Inderjeet Singh said, ""More than 180 to 190 trains pass through the city.Every day, trains cause two to three deaths in Ludhiana and on the 143km track outside the city.

1781,"If everyone around you is staring at their phones lately, they may not just be trying to avoid eye contact — they're probably playing Pokémon Go, the augmented reality iteration of the Pokémon franchise that allows players to find and catch Pokémon in the physical space around them. Now that the craze has arrived, the race is on to find and catch the most valuable Pokémon in the Pokédex — especially the Legendaries, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres and Mewtwo ( ). The Legendary Birds also appear as the mascots for Pokémon Go teams, which seems to indicate that they will make an appearance at some point in the course of the game. But it seems unlikely that the Legendaries will just be hanging around near your house waiting to be caught. Some have speculated that Legendaries will only be available when players come together for meet-ups that will pit teams against each other in large scale Poké-battles. ""It's likely that Niantic has plans to incorporate the Legendary Pokémon into these large events, to encourage players to work together,"" C reported on Friday. ""We saw a hint of this in Nintendo's first trailer for the game, when hundreds of players gathered in Times Square to fight a Mewtwo. After delivering a final blow seconds before a countdown was set to expire, Mewtwo appeared in all of the players' games, a reward similar to the events seen in regular Pokémon games."" In a 2015 interview about Pokémon Go, Niantic CEO John Hanke said that live events and trading would likely be a big part of the game. ""We'll have events for Pokémon as well,"" Hanke told Venture Beat. Those are competitive, but they can also be places to trade stuff with other players. Pokémon trading is going to be huge. You can't get all of them by yourself. If you want all of them you'll have to trade with other players. Or you have to be someone who takes time off work and travels the world for a year. There may be people who do that. So it may be the case that finding a Legendary Pokémon will require a lot of literal legwork, like traveling to meet-ups or crossing the ocean. Or you can just wait for the moment when someone inevitably comes up with a game hack.","So it may be the case that finding a Legendary Pokémon will require a lot of literal legwork, like traveling to meet-ups or crossing the ocean.

1785,"Nanny dogs, meet the nanny state. Now keep apart, you two. Six states are considering bills that would put an end to laws restricting dog ownership by breed. Called ""breed-specific legislation"" -- or BSL -- these laws most often target pit bull type dogs (which are said to have been called ""nanny dogs""), often forcing people to choose between their pets and their homes. And most Americans think they're bad laws. Bad laws! Opposition to BSL comes from sources as diverse as the American Bar Association, animal rescue groups, the Center for Disease Control and even President Barack Obama, who said in August that the laws are largely ineffective while doing nothing to improve public safety, and are often a ""waste of public resources."" In addition, a recent poll conducted on behalf of the rescue group Best Friends Animal Society found that a big majority in the United States don't want the government deciding which breeds of dogs we may and may not keep as pets: A new national survey commissioned by Best Friends Animal Society reveals that 84 percent of those polled believe that local, state or federal governments should not infringe on a person’s right to own whatever breed of dog they choose. This survey, conducted by Luntz Global, is consistent with a growing trend by many state and local governments that have repealed breed discriminatory provisions and enacted behavior-based, breed-neutral dangerous dog laws. Of the 850 polled, 59 percent were dog owners. Only four percent of those polled believed the federal government should dictate what breed of dog a person could own, while six percent supported state government restrictions and 11 percent local government limits. Seventeen states have already passed laws that stop localities from discriminating against dogs by breed. The six now considering similar prohibitions are Maryland, Vermont, South Dakota, Missouri, Utah and Washington state. ""Today was a good day for dogs,"" Ledy VanKavage, an attorney with Best Friends, told HuffPost just after the South Dakota Senate's Local Government Committee met to consider its bill about a week ago. ""We have 17 states that outlaw it now. We think every state should have it."" VanKavage said that states are becoming more amenable to passing these prohibitions for a combination of reasons. ""People view dogs as members of their family. And more and more cities are getting sued. If a city tried to take my dog simply because of its breed, I'd lawyer up in a minute,"" she said. ""In America, responsible dog owners should be able to have whatever breed of dog they choose."" Plus, VanKavage added, ""The scientific studies show it doesn't work."" Indeed. In December, the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association published a study looking at the factors at play in fatal dog attacks. Studying 256 dog bite fatalities from 2000-2009, the contributing factors were found to include the failure of an able-bodied person to intervene in the attack and the dog being abused by its owner. Breed was not deemed to be a significant contributing factor; the researchers found, moreover, that breed could not even be reliably determined in most of the cases. Best Friends also emphasizes the cost of enforcing anti-pit bull bans; the group commissioned an economist to put together a tool that calculates the costs by city. And here's a sample calculation: In Baltimore, there's an estimated 151,105 dogs, of which 10,918 are assumed pit bull type dogs. The costs associated with enforcing laws against pit bull ownership would be $992,606 per year. Kristen Auerbach, spokesperson for the Fairfax County Animal Shelter in Northern Virginia, says that lifting restrictions against pit bull ownership would have significantly waggy other benefits, as well. Even though her jurisdiction doesn't have breed restrictions, ""people have heard the stories about beloved family dogs being taken from their owners in places where there are full bans on pit bulls. That is every dog owner's worst nightmare,"" she said. ""People don't want to risk it."" Getting rid of these laws would not just let people adopt without fear of their animals being taken away, she said, but would also help counter negative stereotypes. ""BSL not only impacts people in Maryland, but contributes to the overall perception of pit bulls as different, which inevitably works its way into the public conscience and effects adoptions, shelter policies, and even other public policy,"" she said. Auerbach cautions that even if these anti-BSL laws are passed, that isn't the end of these problems, since many landlords won't rent to people with pit bulls. One of several anti-BSL bills now under consideration in Maryland would actually address this point: HB 422 is aimed not only at stopping localities from classifying dogs as ""dangerous"" by breed, but would also apply to landlords and condo associations. But even if these bills weren't a panacea, their passages would mark a significant step forward, said VanKavage. ""If we could get just one or two this year I'd be happy,"" she said. There's reason for optimism: Tami Santelli, Maryland state director for the Humane Society of the United States, tells HuffPost she thinks her state is likely to pass pro-pit bull legislation this session. And on Tuesday, the South Dakota Senate passed its bill, which now moves over to the House.",Six states are considering bills that would put an end to laws restricting dog ownership by breed

Brandi Benner of Clover, South Carolina, has a 2-year-old daughter named Sophia who really wants to be a doctor when she grows up. Benner told The Huffington Post that Sophia is a big fan of the children’s show ""Doc McStuffins"" and takes her interest in medicine very seriously. ""She calls herself ‘Dr. Sophia,’"" Benner told HuffPost. ""Everyone in the house gets several checkups a day from her."" According to Benner, a Dr. Sophia checkup includes listening to patients’ hearts with a toy stethoscope, checking for butterflies or bunnies in their ears with an otoscope and, of course, giving everyone a shot. Benner also said that her young daughter uses the correct names for all her play medical tools. ""The obsession is real,"" she said. On March 31, Benner took Sophia to Target to buy her a reward for using the potty for a month. In the toy aisle, Sophia was naturally drawn to one doll in particular: a girl in a white lab coat with a stethoscope around her neck.  According to a Facebook post Benner wrote about their visit to Target — which has gone viral, receiving over 520,000 likes and 200,000 shares — while the mother and Sophia were checking out, the cashier asked Sophia if she was buying the doll for a friend. Sophia told the cashier the doll was for her and was a reward for learning how to use the toilet. Benner wrote that the cashier then said: ""But she doesn’t look like you. We have lots of other dolls that look more like you."" And Sophia shot back with: ""Yes, she does. She’s a doctor like I’m a doctor. And I’m a pretty girl and she’s a pretty girl.

1793,"Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is concerned that recent terrorist attacks in Russia could turn the upcoming Sochi Olympics into a ""nightmare like Benghazi."" Grimm, a co-chair of the House Russian Caucus, issued a statement Monday condemning the two deadly bombings that took place in the past two days in Russia. Both attacks occurred in the southern city of Volgograd, and together they left at least 31 people dead. Grimm used the opportunity to drudge up memories of the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, as well as the Boston Marathon bombing in April. It was revealed after the bombing that Russia had warned the FBI about one of the two suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. ""We cannot sweep these threats under the rug, like we did with Benghazi or the warnings from Russia on the Tsarnaev brother behind the Boston Marathon bombing,"" Grimm said. ""Each time we fail to recognize these threats, we not only risk the lives of innocent Americans, but appear weaker and vulnerable in the eyes of the enemy."" He added that each threat should be taken seriously ""so that the Winter Olympics remain a dream for athletes around the globe, instead of becoming a nightmare like Benghazi."" While the recent bombings have indeed ignited security concerns ahead of the Sochi Olympics, the parallel to Benghazi is not entirely clear, nor is there any indication that Americans will be under attack during the winter games. Russian authorities have initially linked the attacks to Islamist terrorists from the volatile North Caucasus region. A New York Times investigation published Saturday reported that the Benghazi attack was likely the work of independent Libyan militias. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already called for heightened security across the country in the wake of the attacks. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, wrote a letter to Putin to express ""confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure games in Sochi,"" while the Obama administration offered its ""full support"" to the Russian government as it prepares security for the Olympic Games.

Though the popular designer has seen the storied fashion house through successful times since joining in 1997, he is reportedly internally approved within the company to leave. This isn't the first we've heard of Jacobs and Louis Vuitton going separate ways, though. Back in June, Women's Wear Daily sparked chatter after reporting that Jacobs was being sought after to replace Reed Krakoff as creative director at Coach. Plus, Louis Vuitton is already at work revamping its design team, tapping Proenza Schouler's accessories designer, Darren Spaziani (the man behind the brand's wildly popular PS1 handbag), to spruce up its logo-centric offerings. As for Jacobs' replacement, Nicolas Ghesquière's name has been the front-runner ever since the first round of rumors. The French designer, an industry darling, was unceremoniously ousted from his creative director position at Balenciaga and replaced by Alexander Wang last year. A source confirmed to Fashionista in June that Ghesquière and LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton, were ""in serious negotiations"" about a top position with Louis Vuitton. But until we get official confirmation, we're remaining skeptical. Regarding Jacobs' departure, another industry source told Reuters, ""Nothing has been decided yet.""

Brock Turner has been in jail for just three months of the pathetic six-month sentence he was given, but he Brock Turner has been in jail for just three months of the pathetic six-month sentence he was given, but he will walk free next week thanks to a revolting mix of white privilege and a lie he told during his trial about his drug use. Apparently, this horrible 21-year-old pervert is getting off on ""good behavior"" and because he had said he was new to alcohol and drugs at his trial in June, which was found to be false after some of Turner’s photos and texts were discovered. Even more revolting is that the court seems to be taking his probation far more seriously than the fact that he is a convicted rapist. Turner had tried to portray a clean image in court when he said things like, ""Coming from a small town in Ohio, I had never really experienced celebrating or partying that involved alcohol."" However, his old texts, some dating back to 2014, show this misogynist saying things like: ""Do y’all n****s have marijuana"", talking about how he’s ""wanting a blaze"" [joint] and chides a friend for ""burning through the green"" [weed]. Other older messages show Turner using the N-word a lot, especially when trying to meet up with others to do drugs. One message said, ""Swag. Should I just meet y’all n***** there?"" Now that this evidence emerged, Turner has admitted to drinking heavily and using LSD – a lie that has landed him a three-year probation term – which seems pretty f****ed up considering he only did 3 months in jail for doing one of the most violating things imaginable. He will serve his probation from the comforts of his parents’ home in Dayton, Ohio, because apparently in America, monitoring someone’s drug use is more important than serving time after you rape a human being.

1806,"Nazareth - Israel has agreed to allow the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to send a delegation to Israel and the occupied territories. It was Israel has agreed to allow the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to send a delegation to Israel and the occupied territories. It was revealed over the weekend in a step that could dramatically increase the risk of Israeli officials being tried for war crimes. Emmanuel Nahshon, a foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed to Al Jazeera on Sunday that Israel had agreed to the visit in principle, though the ""when and how"" were still under discussion. The ICC's move comes as human rights groups have harshly criticised Israel for closing investigations into dozens of allegations that its military has broken the laws of war during an attack on Gaza in the summer of 2014. The Hague prosecutors are reportedly interested in examining how effective Israel's legal mechanisms are in investigating allegations of war crimes. Under the terms of its founding statute, the ICC could take over jurisdiction of such probes if it is persuaded that Israel is unable or unwilling to conduct credible investigations itself. So far, only three Israeli soldiers have been indicted on a relatively minor charge - of looting - even though Israel's 51-day offensive , named Protective Edge, in July and August 2014 resulted in some 2,250 Palestinian deaths. The vast majority were civilians, including 551 children. "" We have seen Israel conducting flawed investigations or dragging out the legal process with long delays. The main aim appears to be to place obstacles in the way of the investigations so that Israel's armed forces are not held accountable. Nadeem Shehadeh, a lawyer with Adalah The Israeli military exonerated itself late last month in 13 cases it had been investigating. These included lethal attacks on three Palestinian families, the shelling of a hospital and a United Nations shelter for civilians, and the bombing of Gaza's main power plant. It declined to investigate another 80 complaints. In response, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon criticised Israel for the ""low rate of investigations opened into these serious allegations"". Since Protective Edge, two of Israel's largest human rights groups, B'Tselem and Yesh Din, have refused to cooperate with Israeli investigations in Gaza, accusing the Israeli military of using them to ""whitewash"" its actions. In June, the New York-based monitoring group, Human Rights Watch (HRW), added to the pressure on the ICC, calling for it to open a formal investigation into the Gaza offensive. The credibility of Israel's probes has been further undermined by a report issued last week by two local human rights groups. Adalah and Al Mezan, based in Israel and Gaza, respectively. The report accused Israel of failing to examine properly the evidence they had collected relating to 27 suspected war crimes during the 2014 offensive. Five cases referred to the Israeli attacks on UN schools sheltering civilians.Two years on, the groups noted , Israel had issued no indictments. Investigations, where they occurred, were ""clearly flawed"". Nadeem Shehadeh, a lawyer with Adalah, a legal centre for Palestinian citizens in Israel, told Al Jazeera the possibility of legal redress in many cases was close to ""exhausted"". ""We have seen Israel conducting flawed investigations or dragging out the legal process with long delays,"" he said. ""The main aim appears to be to place obstacles in the way of the investigations so that Israel's armed forces are not held accountable."" Israel's failure to conduct thorough and transparent inquiries could open the door to the ICC launching its own formal investigation, he said. On Friday, an unnamed Israeli official tried to downplay the significance of the visit, telling the Haaretz daily, ""We have nothing to hide."" The official added that Israel would point out to the ICC that it ""has neither the authority nor the justification to handle the Palestinians' complaints"". Nahshon told Al Jazeera: "" The goal is to give the ICC a better grasp on Israel ' s legal and judicial system. "" However, he continued, ""That will make things easier if we move to another stage,"" - an apparent reference to the possibility that the ICC may consider launching a formal investigation. Ghazi Hamad, a Palestinian official dealing with ICC matters, said the Palestinian Authority hoped that the visit would "" speed up the opening of the investigation "" by the court into Israel's conduct during Protective Edge. ""That would provide a clear message to Israel that it cannot continue to commit crimes with impunity,"" he told Al Jazeera. Hamad said the PA was not told whether the ICC had requested or was granted permission from Israel to access Gaza This is the first time Israel has agreed to cooperate with an international body over allegations that could ultimately lead to war crimes trials. Israel denied entry to UN commissions of inquiry in 2009 and 2014, following major offensives in Gaza. Officials in Washington have repeatedly voiced their opposition to the ICC exercising jurisdiction over Israeli nationals. Neither the US nor Israel has ratified the Rome Statute, the document establishing The Hague court in 2002. Sari Bashi, director of the Israel-Palestine branch of HRW, said israel's continuing restrictions on human rights organisations entering Gaza had further undermined the credibility of Israel's investigations. The strict controls had made it ""more difficult for [the groups] to do their jobs and to bring relevant information to light"", she told Al Jazeera. Israeli authorities, she added, had previously conceded that human rights groups played an important role in helping to ""overcome the fear that Palestinian residents have of meeting [Israeli military] personnel."" Al Mezan and Adalah said that, in many cases, Israel had refused to speak to any witnesses outside the military before it dropped inquiries into suspected war crimes. Israel has received a total of 500 complaints relating to 360 incidents in Gaza in which there are suspicions of violations of international law. So far, only a handful of investigations have been opened, relating mainly to physical assaults on civilians, ""unlawful firing"" at buildings, and looting. On August 24, Israeli announced the closure of more than 93 cases. In 80 cases, no formal investigation was conducted. Two years on, Israel is still undecided whether to scrutinise some of the most contentious phases of its offensive, including the massive bombardment of Rafah to prevent an Israeli soldier from being taken as prisoner. The incident, known as Black Friday, is believed to have killed more than 100 Palestinian residents of the area. Aida Burnett-Cargill, a spokeswoman in Gaza for Al Mezan, said Palestinian human rights organisations had sent to the ICC Palestinian witness statements relating to Black Friday in March. "" We hope these materials and others are raising doubts in the minds of the ICC's prosecutors about the seriousness with which Israel is handling its investigations,"" she told Al Jazeera. Hamad said that the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad al-Malki, had met the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, in The Hague on Friday to promise any help the court might need to launch a formal investigation. The ICC is currently conducting a ""preliminary inquiry"" to examine whether an investigation is warranted into suspected violations of international law, either by Israel or Palestinian factions. Protective Edge is the first major offensive against the Palestinians over which The Hague court has potential jurisdiction. In ratifying the Rome Statute last year, the Palestinians gave the ICC authority from June 2014, a month before Israel's attack on Gaza. Among the investigations Israel closed last month was one looking into the shelling of a UN school in Rafah that was serving as a temporary shelter for 3,000 Palestinians. Some 12 civilians, including eight children, were killed and at least 25 injured. Chris Gunness, a UN spokesman in Jerusalem, told Al Jazeera that Israel had been given the school's coordinates and was warned on 33 separate occasions of its role as a shelter, the last time being an hour before the attack. Human rights groups have challenged Israel's claims that the school was hit because militants riding a motorbike changed course towards the school after a missile had been fired at them. Al Mezan's testimonies suggest that the riders were civilians and should not have been targeted. HRW, meanwhile, discovered that the type of munition Israel used could have been diverted when it was clear it would explode near the school. Adalah and Al Mezan said Israeli authorities had refused to divulge the basis for most of their decisions either to exonerate soldiers or refuse the opening of investigations, claiming the evidence was classified. Human rights groups have criticised the closing of other investigations. In June, inquiries were dropped against Neria Yeshurun, a brigade commander who had admitted to ordering the shelling of a medical clinic ""to raise morale"", apparently in revenge after one of his officers was killed. He was reprimanded instead. In another controversial case, Israel closed an investigation in June 2015 into the killing of four boys as they played football on a beach, close to hotels where foreign reporters were based. Shehadeh said Adalah, which supplied testimonies to Israel about the boys' deaths, had immediately appealed the decision to Israel's attorney general but had heard nothing for more than a year. In May, leading Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said it would no longer submit complaints to the Israeli authorities. It said it was pointless to work ""with a system whose real function is measured by its ability to continue to successfully cover up"".",It was revealed over the weekend in a step that could dramatically increase the risk of Israeli officials being tried for war crimes.
1807,"The drive home after a night shift can be hazardous too, confirms a small but compelling new study involving a global team of researchers from Boston and Australia. They conducted daytime driving tests on a closed driving track among 16 night shift workers who had just come off the job. The study found that the volunteers' driving was dangerously worse after work than if they'd had a full night's sleep. Six of the participants (37.5 percent) had 11 near-crashes during the driving test, which required the safety supervisors to use their emergency brakes to prevent a collision. The researchers terminated the two-hour driving test early for seven participants (43.8 percent) over concerns for the safety of everyone in the car. Based on the numbers, the researchers suggest that the night shift workers and their employers find a way for workers to get home that doesn’t involve getting into the driver’s seat of a car, or come up with strategies to reduce drowsiness after a shift. ""These findings help to explain why night shift workers have so many more motor vehicle crashes than day workers, particularly during the commute home,"" said study co-author Dr. Charles A. Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in a statement. The study is the first time researchers have assessed the impact of night shift work on driving in real vehicles, as opposed to using a simulated method. After sleeping almost eight hours the night before with no shift work, the 16 participants had zero near-crashes -- and all finished the agreed-upon two-hour driving test. But when participants went through the same test after a night shift (at this point, it had been an average of 13 hours since their last sleep), there was a statistically significant increase in lane drifting, slow eye movements and ""microsleep episodes"" -- temporary shut-eye that last more than three seconds. All of the near crashes occurred after at least 45 minutes into the driving test. About 15 percent of workers in the U.S. drive more than 45 minutes each way of their commute, the study notes. The researchers wrote that the safety supervisors who accompanied participants on these driving tests could tell that the workers were drowsy and impaired within the first 15 minutes of the drive. The experiment, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted on a driving track that belongs to vehicle insurer Liberty Mutual Insurance. In an emailed statement to The Huffington Post, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety said that they hope ""a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in drowsy driving can lead to effective prevention strategies that would help alleviate this major public health concern."" There are several limitations of the study. One in particular is that the driving tests took place on a closed driving track with a simple design relative to real streets. Even though this means the participants were driving real cars, they were not encountering real-life commuting challenges like the behavior of other cars, pedestrian traffic and complex road navigation. The additional challenges of a real commute may actually serve to enhance wakefulness in drivers, as the higher stakes might force them to be more alert, the researchers note. The study's observation methods -- like having to stop the driving test every 15 minutes to survey the driving participants, asking the drivers to attach EEG electrodes to their heads to measure the microsleep episodes and making them wear special glasses to measure the speed of their eye movements and how long they blinked -- may have artificially made the participants more alert than they’d normally be on a real drive home. Yet, Czeisler points out, all these conditions, the monitoring measures and added social pressure, couldn’t keep about 44 percent of participants alert enough to complete the driving test. ""This was real driving in an actual car, putting everyone involved in the experiment at considerable risk,"" he said. ""And yet the impairment still came through, which shows just how strong the biological drive for sleep is."" The responsibility is on everyone -- from the shift workers to companies and all the way up to public officials -- to work on countermeasures to combat the dangers of drowsy driving, Czeisler said. For instance, while drinking coffee can help keep night shift workers awake on their commute home, it’s no solution to drowsy driving, and it may make matters worse for night shift workers in the long run, Czeisler explained. ""Yes, caffeine will help, but there’s no silver bullet here that will solve the problem because what tends to happen is that people drink caffeine and then push themselves harder,"" he said. ""The other problem with caffeine is that it interferes with daytime sleep, and [night shift workers] have enough trouble sleeping during the daytime in between shifts -- let alone if they’re drinking caffeine right before going to bed."" Instead of relying on caffeine, night shift workers should invest in blackout shades and other tools to help them sleep during the daytime, in between shifts, Czeisler said. And if banking a normal amount of sleep during the daytime isn’t helping, consider going to the doctor, Czeisler suggested, who may diagnose shift work disorder and prescribe medication to help keep you awake on a long drive home. Companies have a responsibility as well to guard against drowsy driving, Czeisler continued. ""Let’s say there's a factory one hour away from a major city,"" he said. ""Presuming people are going to drive that distance, [the company] should hire a shuttle service, at the very least to bring people to a major city where they can get public transportation to their homes."" Drowsy driving is a serious problem in the U.S. About four percent of Americans report that they’ve fallen asleep while driving , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that driving while sleepy was a factor in 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries and 800 deaths in 2013. These numbers are likely an underestimate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those most at risk of drowsy driving are shift workers, commercial truck and bus drivers, people with untreated sleep disorders or who take sleep medications and anyone who simply doesn't get enough sleep, according to the CDC. If you’ve missed your exit, find yourself drifting across lanes or hit a rumble strip (bumps on the side of the road meant to jolt you awake), pull over immediately to sleep or change drivers, the public health institute advises. Blasting the radio or rolling down the windows do not help keep you awake, authorities warn. ""You might say, well there’s no other way I can get home from work,"" Czeisler said. ""But if you realized that you might actually die or kill somebody, maybe you’d come up with another alternative.""",The study found that the volunteers' driving was dangerously worse after work than if they'd had a full night's sleep
1808,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Ashton Eaton is a decorated member of Team USA, yet on the first day of track and field competition of these Rio Olympics, he was spotted in the stands at Olympic Stadium wearing a Canada hat. It turns out, he has a pretty good reason. Eaton, the defending Olympic champion and world record-holder in the decathlon, is married to Canadian heptathlete Brianne Theisen-Eaton. They met as members of the University of Oregon’s track team. Eaton was born in Portland, Ore., and Theisen-Eaton is from Saskatchewan, so while they’re both competing for gold at these Olympics, the two are representing different countries. Needless to say, some people weren’t happy to see Eaton repping the maple leaf on Friday night. Eaton took notice of some of the comments and immediately hopped on Twitter to respond, offering a sharp rebuke to anyone who questioned him, his patriotism or his motives. There were still plenty of track and field fans both before and after Eaton’s posts — people from both sides of the border — offering words of support, touched by a husband rooting on his wife in such a visible manner. Midway through the heptathlon, Theisen-Eaton is in sixth place, with the final three events scheduled for Saturday. Eaton’s competition doesn’t begin until Wednesday. It’s a safe bet that he’ll be sporting red, white and blue by then.",is married to Canadian heptathlete Brianne Theisen-Eaton

1811,"A 16-year-old from Nebraska who pleaded guilty to throwing her newborn out a window was sentenced on Friday to probation and ordered to live in a group home. Douglas County Juvenile Court Judge Christopher Kelly also told Antonia Lopez that she must receive therapy, delete her Facebook account, and perform 50 hours of community service, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Police say she gave birth September 30 at her mother’s apartment in Omaha before she threw the child out the window. Lopez then told her mother, who called 911 after she found the child. The baby was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Lopez reportedly messaged her boyfriend on Snapchat after the infant’s death, saying, ""It was a girl by the way,"" the New York Post reported. An autopsy revealed that the child was in her seventh month of development and suffered bleeding near her skull, brain, spine, and abdomen from the blunt-force trauma. Lopez was initially going to be charged as an adult with one count of felony child abuse resulting in death, a charge that carries a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. The case was transferred to juvenile court after the district attorney’s office took into account her mental state, actions, and lack of criminal record. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine said Lopez did not plan her actions, which were more of a ""panicked reaction."" Lopez told a police detective that she did not know she was pregnant and thought she was just having her period when she woke up in pain.

1816,"We’ve all been there, you buy some potatoes, pop them in the cupboard, and then promptly forget about them. Then the next time you open up the cupboard, you discover said potatoes have started sprouting and now resemble an alien lifeform. So what do you do? Do you cut off the sprouts and bring them to the boil, or chuck them in the bin deeming them inedible? You may have heard horror stories of people being poisoned by sprouting potatoes, but is there actually any truth to any of these tales? To answer this question, first we need to know a little bit about what a potato actually is in terms of its botanical structure. Many people think of potatoes as root vegetables because they grow underground like carrots, parsnips and other root crops. But in actual fact they are a type of ""modified stem"" known as a tuber. These are compacted, swollen stems which are produced underground and remain there when the ""parent plant"" (the old plant that produced this year’s crop) has died down. This allows the plants to survive through the cold winter period because the tubers are deep below the soil surface where they are protected from frost. Mamziolzi/Shutterstock Most of us are aware that potatoes are high in carbohydrates. This is because they need enough stored food to survive the winter. Food in the form of sugars is created by photosynthesis – which you will remember from school biology classes is the process by which plants use energy from sunlight to produce glucose (or sugars) from carbon dioxide and water. While some of this energy is used up by plants straight away, perennial plants – those that live for more than two growing seasons – will store energy for the onset of growth the following spring. They need this food to be able to generate sufficient energy to grow up to the soil surface and grow new leaves before they can start to photosynthesise. In other words, potatoes contain the ""packed lunch"" that will keep them alive through the winter and produce the first flush of growth. Toxic Tatties? If you look closely at a potato you will notice the ""eyes"" – the little spots you see when looking at the skin or peel of a potato. These are in fact the nodes of the stem. And on a normal stem above ground these give rise to new leaves and branches. These form the shoots that start to grow on potatoes if you leave them in the cupboard for too long. They are triggered into growth by the warmth of your house and if they are exposed to any light this will accelerate the process. This is why potatoes should be kept in a cool, dark place for maximum shelf life. But what about when they turn green? Most of us are aware that we shouldn’t eat green potatoes. But why? panco971/Shutterstock Exposure to light triggers certain physiological reactions within the tuber. The production of chlorophyll triggers the green colour – this is not at all harmful and indeed contains high quantities of beneficial minerals such as iron. It is also what creates the deep green colour found in all edible leafy green vegetables. But light and warmth also triggers the production of Solanine – a chemical which can cause symptoms of poisoning in humans if ingested in large quantities. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, headaches and dizziness. This chemical tends to be concentrated under the skin of the potatoes alongside the chlorophyll and also in the newly developing shoots. So it may be advisable not to eat green potatoes or those that have begun to grow shoots. Grow Your Own Of course, you can remove the green area of peel and the shoots which will reduce any chance of a toxic reaction but there can still be a bitter flavour to potatoes that have begun to grow. The start of the growth process will also begin the assimilation of the sugars and vitamins present which means that the potato is now less nutritious, too. Standret/Shutterstock Having said that, when stuck for something to eat, I have knocked small shoots off potatoes and peeled off any green bits many a time. I just wouldn’t eat any with extensive shoot growth and dark green patches. Instead, these can be planted out to grow a new batch of potatoes. They won’t be certified virus-free like a bought ""seed"" potato, but they should provide you with a small bounty later on. In winter, they will also need a frost-free environment to grow. And if you have no space to grow them and really hate waste then remove the shoots and green skin, boil them and chop them up and feed them to the birds. They’ll be delighted.

1817,"When Molly Draper found out her 10-year-old daughter, Lena, messaged the local police department on Facebook requesting help with her math homework, she couldn’t believe it.  Not only that: they actually responded. Lena sent a message to the Marion, Ohio, Police Department’s Facebook page last week, explaining that she was having trouble with her fifth-grade math assignment. Instead of turning her away, Draper says Marion Police Dept. Lt. B.J. Gruber, the officer who runs the page, simply responded, ""Ok with what?"" The 10-year-old began to list some math problems, ""Well I don’t understand (8+29)x15."" ""Do the numbers in the parenthesis first so in essence it would be 37 x 15,"" the officer responded. The little girl then asked the officer another difficult question. ""Ok now if I had this (90+27) + (29+15) x 2. Which one would I do first?"" ""Take the answer from the first parenthesis plus the answer from the second parenthesis and multiply that answer times two,"" Gruber explained. ""Work left to right doing the work inside the parenthesis first."" ""I was happy, but not surprised that they responded so quickly,"" Draper told CBS News. ""They are wonderful with their communication with the community."" Afterward, Draper posted screenshots of their exchange on Facebook, and the post went viral with more than 2,100 shares. Unfortunately, as some Facebook users pointed out, some the officer’s guidance turned out to be incorrect. ""Order of operations... PEMDAS! (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication & Division, Addition and Subtraction). For future reference,"" one Facebook user said, referring to the officer’s second answer. But Gruber is hoping people will give him an ""A"" for effort. ""Hoping it is truly the thought that counts since apparently I cannot!"" he joked.

1818,"(CNN) In recent years, FIFA has made news not just for enforcing rules on the soccer field, but also for allegedly breaking them off it. The body that governs soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is a multibillion-dollar behemoth. Great power, yes. Great responsibility? Not so much, critics say. FIFA has been regularly accused of bribery and kickbacks, allegations that reached a fever pitch after it awarded Russia and Qatar the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Afterward, the group carried out its own internal investigation and cleared itself. So why is the United States, a country where soccer ranks far below football and basketball in popularity, now taking top FIFA officials to court on corruption charges Most of the 14 people indicted aren't Americans. But as U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch lays it out, the suspects planned their crimes in the U.S.; they used the U.S. banking system; they planned to profit through schemes that targeted the ""growing U.S. market for soccer."" ""This is a U.S. case,"" David Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, said Wednesday on CNN. In order to understand how, we'll have to take you through a journey that, as you'll see, involves Americans at all stages. First up ... Michael Garcia Michael Garcia: The World Cup is a big deal. It comes around every four years, and when it does, it's the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. When FIFA awarded the 2018 games to Russia and followed that with the even more head-scratching choice of Qatar in 2022, critics and other governments cried foul. They smelled shenanigans. They wanted a transparent account of the bidding process to see if Qatar and Russia cut any corners. FIFA brought in Michael Garcia, a onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was tasked with looking into the behavior of the two nations. He spent 19 months scrutinizing the bids to host the two tournaments. By the time he was done, his findings stretched to 350 pages. So what did FIFA do? It suppressed the report, released a puny 42-page summary -- and cleared itself of any wrongdoing in November. Garcia hit back. He labeled FIFA's findings on his report ""incomplete and erroneous."" Then you have ... Loretta Lynch James Comey and Loretta Lynch: As we mentioned earlier, Garcia is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The guy who held that job before him? James Comey. He's the current FBI director. And the corruption charges are a result of a three-year FBI investigation. Then there's the second New York connection: Attorney General Loretta Lynch She oversaw the case in Brooklyn before she was appointed to lead the Justice Department. But why did U.S. authorities start looking into FIFA to begin with? When FIFA cleared itself of wrongdoing, the FBI wasn't ready to do the same. It wanted to know whether any of the allegations of bribe-taking and kickbacks by FIFA officials took place on American soil. Enter ... Chuck Blazer sits behind FIFA President Joseph Blatter in 2011 in Switzerland. Chuck Blazer Chuck Blazer, an American, was the No. 2 man in CONCACAF, the FIFA-affiliated governing body for North America and the Caribbean. The organization has its headquarters in Florida. Blazer had found himself in a bind. He had amassed $11 million in unreported income, the IRS said, and he hadn't paid his taxes for many, many years. He was looking at some serious prison time. He pleaded guilty in 2013 on corruption charges and became a wire-wearing informant for the feds. He provided documents and recordings of meetings with FIFA colleagues that hinted at not-so-kosher dealings, law enforcement officials said. That meant looking into the dealings of ... Jeffrey Webb, head of CONCACAF CONCACAF Remember when we mentioned CONCACAF? U.S. soccer falls under that governing body. With Blazer as a cooperating witness, American officials set out to see whether corruption touched tournaments held in the Americas. The feds say it did. One of the people facing charges now is Jeffrey Webb. He's a FIFA vice president; he heads CONCACAF; and he was Blazer's boss. Webb ""used his position of trust to solicit bribes from sports marketing executives,"" acting U.S. Attorney Kelly T. Currie of the Eastern District of New York said In return, they provided media, marketing and sponsorship rights to soccer matches in the Americas. Prosecutors said those arrested accepted bribes and kickbacks totaling more than $100 million, from the early 1990s until now. For example, $110 million in bribes changed hands in bringing Copa America , a soccer tournament usually held in South America, to the United States in 2016, Lynch said. But can the U.S. actually go after FIFA officials? Yes. Because it is ... The seal of the FBI The United States of America: The United States brought charges against the suspects because the plots were allegedly hatched on American soil. ""According to U.S. request, these crimes were agreed and prepared in the U.S., and payments were carried out via U.S. banks,"" the Swiss Office of Justice said. Prosecutors also say they think the broad reach of U.S. tax and banking regulations aid their ability to bring the charges. In addition, U.S. authorities claim jurisdiction because the American television market, and billions paid by U.S. networks, is the largest for the World Cup.",corruption touched tournaments held in the Americas
1819,"Dave Brat had two paid staffers who ran his campaign on a flip phone. That contrast is a microcosm of the difference in sophistication between Cantor’s campaign, and the insurgent challenge of Dave Brat, a relatively unknown economics professor from Randolph-Macon College. And it illustrates just how shocking it is that Brat was able to topple the majority leader after 13 years representing Virginia’s conservative Seventh District in Washington.  In interviews here with Brat and Cantor allies, and Brat himself, a sketch of the insurgent’s winning strategy emerges — and it runs completely counter to the conventional wisdom of this election cycle.  This year was branded as one where the establishment strikes back. In some places, it has — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) toppled his tea party challenger by running an aggressive campaign.  But people in Cantor and Brat’s camps say that the majority leader struck back too hard.  Cantor’s aides take pride in running a strong race against any candidate — Democrat or Republican. But the $2 million Cantor spent to brand Brat as a liberal professor may have had the reverse effect, people close to him and Brat say. It showed voters there was an alternative to Cantor -and that was exactly what many voters wanted.  ""The negative ads calling me a liberal professor at first they started off with kind of comic strips,"" Brat said in an interview here late Tuesday night. ""And everyone kind of liked them. Me and my boy watched them the first night and kind of died laughing. We thought they were funny.""  ""They gave me $1 million in name ID and I think that got us going, I think. I’m not a political expert on that, but I think they kind of saw that was happening and they made those a little darker, and they were black and green and looked like a Star Wars thing by the time they got done with it – it made me look like a pretty serious guy.""  In both Richmond and Washington, the political class is stunned by Cantor’s defeat. But in an April interview with POLITICO, and again Tuesday night, Brat maintained that he thought he had Cantor cornered. He just didn’t have the polling or political operation to prove it.  On Tuesday night, when the 11-point win was in the books, Brat conceded he was shocked. His supporters flooded the atrium of an office building here in the Richmond suburbs. But Brat sat removed from the action in an office with empty soda cans strewn across a table, chatting on his cellphone. A few volunteers, aides and supporters ate freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and crackers. Brat was sifting through 100 voice mails and 300 texts and emails, he said. Brat said he had not spoken to Cantor since the majority leader conceded in a ballroom at a Westin Hotel in Richmond.  National mood, he said, played a role in his victory.  ""I think it was just kind of a perfect combination of when I was walking door-to-door, you just go up to the door and talk to the average person and everybody is in agreement that the country’s on the wrong track, right?"" he said, before appearing on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program.  ""You just walk up to the door and say, ‘How are you doing?’ and everyone knows we’re on the wrong track. The problem with modern politics is everybody is doing sound bite stuff. In my stump speech, I give 20 minutes on why I think we’re off track. And I think people do really want to engage in a serious high-level discussion on how to get the country back on track because people care about their own country.""  Indeed, Brat did talk about policy in his stump speech. He railed on Cantor for enabling President Barack Obama, said he supported ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants and blamed him for lax insider trading rules for lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill. Brat also got a bit lucky. At the same time he was emerging, Cantor and his political team were angering conservatives by trying to tighten their grip on the Virginia Republican Party. Cantor tried to boost Linwood Cobb, his close ally, for a local Republican Party chairmanship, and failed. It was a loss that most of his aides brushed aside, but caused real ire among tea partiers.  That widespread discontent became evident Tuesday evening. Cantor lost six of the 10 counties in his district, including Henrico County, his longtime political base.  ""I honestly thought there was a win when I ran way back in January or I wouldn’t have done it,"" Brat said. ""I wasn’t doing it to make a statement. I was doing it because I want to serve the people. I thought it, but that’s far different than doing it. So yeah, it’s an absolute shock to actually execute and follow through on it. It was up to the people right? I’m just one person.""  He added: ""So what I did couldn’t have made this happen. I was completely dependent on the will of the people in the whole process. They went out knocking doors. We didn’t know if it was going to come to fruition or not. We had no evidence. We didn’t have the money to do fine-tuning polling.""  The challenge for Brat now is to avoid missteps that frequently trip up political neophytes. He and his aides know it. They’re all exhausted, and now have to juggle media requests from all over the country. They have to get a new office, and begin to examine their race against Jack Trammell, the Democrat running for the seat. The district is solidly Republican, though: Mitt Romney won it by 15 points in 2012, and John McCain won it by 12 in 2009.  Meanwhile, Brat said he needs to recharge.  ""I’m going to relax for a little while and enjoy my family,"" Brat said. ""I haven’t gotten to hit a tennis ball with my kid and go swimming and stuff. I need a little break.""  When Brat began to walk away from the interview, he quickly turned around and stopped. He said he had just spoken to Sean Hannity on the telephone, and said he wished the press would stop labeling his victory as the conservative right toppling the establishment.  ""I do want to add that the press – and I’ve heard there’s already some senior Democratic officials trying to spin this as a matter of right or left – and I just reject those categories. I’m running on free markets, constitutional principles. I don’t think free markets are either right or left. I don’t think the rule of law is either right or left. So through the duration of the last six months the press has been trying to pigeonhole me. Some people call me a liberal professor, other people call me a tea party candidate.""  When asked if he is a tea partier, Brat said, ""I just say what I say — I’m running on the Republican principles, the creed. I’ve given stump speech after stump speech on those six principles that I believe in and I have huge grassroots and tea party support, and I owe those people the election. I owe Republicans, tea party, grassroots — they all came together and helped me win tonight. Utter thanks, but the press is trying to do this sound bite stuff and put you in a little hole, and peg you in one way or the other.  ""I do just want to emphasize I’m running on ideas and principles. It’s for real. And so the press ignored me last time when I said that. Everyone’s acting like it’s a mystery how I won. I think the American people actually like principles and ideals. That’s what I said for six months and no one paid any attention. And so now that I won, it’s a shocker, I think it’s for real, based on those themes: principles and ideas matter."" ","Indeed, Brat did talk about policy in his stump speech.

1822,"Here’s how long it takes to reach the centre of No Man’s Sky Image: no-mans-sky.com Earlier, there were reports that a copy of No Man’s Sky had landed in the hands of an individual who further sold it to another guy for a whopping $2000. The guy who bought the game has been leaking information about it on Reddit. According to the comments posted by daymeeuhn on Reddit, the center of the galaxy in No Man’s Sky can be reached in around 20-30 hours after exploiting a resource farming method. Here are some of his comments: ""Around 25-30 hours. I’m about halfway there. 30% of the 100% distance has been just from the last few hours alone. With a YouTube video explaining how to do this I think someone could reach the center in no time, 20-30 hours easy. ""They have implemented some questionable design choices that allow you to essentially ""farm"" Warp Fuel in an endless pattern and just continuously warp at will almost nonstop, if you so desire to take advantage of it. I dunno if this was intentional, or if they just didn’t care, or if HG doesn’t actually have min/max gamers on their testing team to identify this stuff or what but I figured it out rather quickly and I’ve managed to jump pretty far in just a few hours of doing it."" You can find the exact method of the process he has followed in this Reddit thread. Remember, this thread contains plenty of game spoilers. There would certainly be some quicker ways to progress in the game which will be unveiled after its release. No Man’s Sky is a game which is based on exploration and discovery, which will definitely be time consuming. However, many people thought it would take a lot of time to reach the game’s centre, but they might be a bit disappointed hearing this piece of news.

1825,"So you want to collect all the Pokemon and the experience, but hate doing the actual job? The good news, for you, is that there are ways to cheat at it if you so desire. The good news, for everyone else, is that cheaters are going to be banned. Softly. But still banned. So if you’re thinking about pulling crazy stunts to collect Pokemon without running around like a crazy person, you should think twice about doing it. If you hire someone to walk your Pokemon Go game for you, that’s still cheating, but nobody will care. If you drive around and playing Pokemon Go, you might get yourself into legal troubles , but nobody will care. But if you use more advanced tactics that include GPS spoofing or using modified versions of the game, then Niantic and Nintendo will take action against cheating. Players who were dealt bans for using GPS spoofing hacks could no longer catch Pokemon, collect PokeStops, or battle/claim a gym, Polygon reports The players discovered that the Pokemon would just run away when hit with a PokeBall, rather than adding itself to their collection. The ban, however, is temporary, lasting for a few hours, which means cheaters can get back to cheating once that’s done. However, this proves that Niantic is paying close attention to those people bending the rules, and is working on appropriate consequences for these actions. Unfortunately, nothing is official on the matter, so we have no idea what kind of offenses are punishable, and to what extent.","Players who were dealt bans for using GPS spoofing hacks could no longer catch Pokemon, collect PokeStops, or battle/claim a gym, Polygon reports The players discovered that the Pokemon would just run away when hit with a PokeBall, rather than adding itself to their collection."

1833,"IQ tests are available by the thousands online – but it can be difficult to know which ones are the most reliable. And while it's nice to think you can take a quick IQ test and potentially discover that you’re actually a genius, people rarely question what it actually means - or how a set of questions can actually measure it. Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman once explained IQ like this: If a subject’s 'mental age' was the same as his or her physical age, their 'intelligence quotient,' or IQ, was defined as exactly 100. If a subject lagged in mental age compared to physical age, the IQ was less than a hundred; if she was more mentally advanced, she was assigned an IQ above 100. Unfortunately, the most comprehensive IQ test doesn’t actually exist, because they don’t really work. Scientists have argued that intelligence cannot simply be measured by asking a few questions and assigning a score, as much as we would like it to. Siddartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Gene: An Intimate History, explains: Intelligence and temperament are not marathon races: there are no fixed criteria for success, no start or finish lines — and running sideways or backward, might secure victory. In short, there's no objective measure of intelligence - it's a multifaceted thing.",there's no objective measure of intelligence - it's a multifaceted thing
1835,"Many major retailers, such as Walmart and Sears, have banned selling Confederate flags from their stores. E-commerce retailers like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Google Shopping, and Overstock have joined in banning the images of the flag. Prior to banning products with the flag, Amazon's sales of the controversial symbol were skyrocketing. Even Apple removed games in the app stores with the flag. Governor Nikki Haley said it was ""time to from the [Confederate] flag from the Capitol grounds"" after the horrifying shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. She said the suspected Charleston shooter viewed the flag in a ""sick and twisted"" way. A controversy has stirred the nation over whether it is or isn't appropriate to sell the Confederate flag. People who support the flag say it is an important part of American history. But major retailers are worried about image, and making profits from the flags isn't worth the consequence of being perceived as racist, Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc., a retail consulting agency and investment banking firm based in New York, told Business Insider ""This is no longer acceptable,"" Davidowitz said. ""And it went from being acceptable to no longer being acceptable pretty quick [so now] everybody is bailing out on it... no one wants to be seen as a racist or anything associated with racism."" These retailers have to consider the people who would be offended. ""Their image is tremendously important to them, with their employees, with their shareholders, with their investors,"" Davidowitz said. ""There's no way they can be associated with this."" ""Number one, [you'll be] turning off millions of customers if you sell [the Confederate flag], number two, [you'll be] turning off your own employees,"" Davidowitz said. This is particularly crucial for Wal-Mart. ""Most of their employees are part time employees — many of them are minorities,"" Davidowitz said, also mentioning that selling the flag ""will demotivate"" employees. ""If you're Wal-Mart, there is nothing more charged than race. That is more nuclear than any of [Wal-Mart's other] issues."" However, Davidowitz highlighted that major retailer brands banning the flag will not put an end to sales of the flag in general. ""They're still going to be sold,"" he said. ""But they're going to be sold by independent stores across America who are going to do a tremendous amount of business selling the Confederate flag.""","Governor Nikki Haley said it was ""time to from the [Confederate] flag from the Capitol grounds"" after the horrifying shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina."
1836,"There were so many rumours about Apple's plans to ditch the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 that it came as no surprise last September when the firm unveiled its Lightning EarPods. Its AirPods, however, were a little less expected. Here's all the big (and small) Apple news you missed Here's all the big (and small) Apple news you missed Apple AirPods are effectively the same as EarPods but without the cable. They are powered by Apple's wireless W1 chip and balance in the ear. The AirPods connect to any Bluetooth 4.0 device and contain accelerometers that know when the AirPods are in your ear, and play – or stop – music accordingly. Elsewhere, a built-in microphone can be used to speak to Siri or make hands-free calls. Our biggest criticism of Apple's existing range of EarPods is how uncomfortable they are. For a company that prides itself on design - and now has the audio and musical expertise of engineers from Dr Dre's Beats – its earphones have often bordered on appalling. There are even memes about how poor the sound quality and 'leakage' have been on previous models. Following an initial hands-on with the AirPods at the September event, we criticised the AirPods for continuing this frustrating trend. Having now spent more than two months using them, has our opinion changed? Design and fit The lack of wires on the AirPods is an immediate bonus as it reduces the weight and pull on your ears as you wear them. This isn't any better or worse than other, similar wireless earphones, though, so hardly sets Apple apart. They are also far from snug when compared to the fitting of rival in-ear earphones, but are substantially more comfortable than any of Apple's audio products that have come before. In fact, that last sentence is indicative of our time with the AirPods and should caveat everything that follows - AirPods are not as bad as we thought they would be, but they're starting from a point of low expectation, and are nowhere near the high standard of other brands. Wearing the Apple AirPods draws some odd looks. People who are aware of them either admire you for wearing them (a man on the Tube remarked how cool they were) or frown at you, seemingly berating your choice. People who aren't aware of them (family members being a case in point) made - albeit tiresome - jokes about how we'd broken our earphones, while asking where the rest of them were. Of course, these people may have simply been looking at us like that anyway, but wearing AirPods makes you self-conscious and a little paranoid and this feeling becomes amplified when making calls or using Siri. Double tapping the AirPods activates Siri, as long as your phone has a web connection. You can then use Siri in the same way you would control the personal assistant on your phone. Shouting commands into, what to others looks like thin air, is unnerving though, and making calls while wearing AirPods is a similarly strange experience. Many of us have become accustomed to seeing other people talking to themselves before noticing their mouthpiece attached to earphones. At the wrong angle, AirPods seemingly vanish making it look like you're actually talking to yourself. That said, we were pleasantly surprised with how well the AirPods picked up our voice without needing a microphone next to our mouth, and they did so particularly well in noisy environments. Tap gestures can be used to answer and end these calls, too. Audio quality Credit to Apple, it does appear to have learnt from some of its previous mistakes. There is much less sound leakage on the AirPods compared to previous EarPods and songs only started to be audible to people around us on the highest volumes. In the office, we tend to listen to music with one earphone in (so we can still hear colleagues but block out other noise). This is possible with AirPods but takes a little manoeuvring because AirPods will stop playing as soon as one of them is removed. A very minor point, but a valid one nonetheless. Unlike its EarPods, or a myriad rival earphones, it's not possible to change the volume or skip tracks on the AirPods. This was a significant downside for us and is the main reason we wouldn't switch to using AirPods full time. It is an action we make regularly throughout the day and having to get our phone out each time was inconvenient, to say the least. You can skip tracks using Siri, but by the time you've activated it and spoken the command, it's quicker to use your phone. Siri also doesn't work underground when without a web connection, and we will refer you to our previous point about feeling self-conscious when wearing them. Exercising with AirPods The lack of wires is fantastic when out running and we were impressed the AirPods didn't easily fall out while exercising. Hands on with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Hands on with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus On a 5km run, they didn't fall out once but did come loose a number of times which required us to adjust them. This was similar when cycling. Of course, when doing yoga it's not practical to wear AirPods, but the same can be said of any earphones - wireless or not. We also attempted to make the AirPods fall out while dancing vigorously (to Drake, no less) but even then they only became loose with particularly sharp head turns. Pairing and battery life Apple's AirPods come in their own charging case, which (like almost everything Apple) is sleek, neat and practical. With a built-in Bluetooth chip, the case will automatically pair with any Bluetooth-connected iPhone, iPad or iPod touch as soon as the lid is lifted. We struggled to pair the AirPods with an iPhone unless the two devices were practically touching, though. When a phone is recognised, a simple pop-up appears on the device you want to pair with and the AirPods are ready to use. Apple claims the AirPods deliver an 'industry-leading' five hours of listening time on one charge but adds they will last 24 hours if you have the charging case with you. This is accurate, but frustrating. We don't want to have to place the AirPods back into the case half way through the day and sit in silence while we wait for them to charge. We often found ourselves resorting to our wired earphones while waiting, defeating the point somewhat. This is a problem with many wireless earphones, though. A significant flaw with the AirPods case, in our experience, was that the magnets in the case regularly wiped our train ticket. If placed near each other in a bag, the ticket failed to work and had to be reprinted which meant making sure they weren't in close proximity - far from ideal. Price The AirPods are not cheap. While the Lightning EarPods ship with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, along with an adapter so you can continue to use your existing earphones with the new handsets, the AirPods cost an additional $159 in the US or £159 in the UK and must be bought separately. This is expensive anyway, but when you factor in the average audio quality and loose fit it widens the chasm between the AirPods and its rivals. Verdict Two months with the AirPods was enough time to convince us the earpods aren't as bad as we thought but not enough for to make us want to swap our wired Sennheiser earphones for Apple's wireless ones. Apple’s AirPods are selling surprisingly well Apple’s AirPods are selling surprisingly well Before writing the review we felt seven was a fair score but as we began to list all the ways we were disappointed this score moved down to six - and even fellow users have said this is high. Having traditionally abandoned Apple's own EarPods in favour of rivals we're not willing to gamble on Apple's free, Lightning EarPods, let alone pay £159 for the privilege of having a wireless range.

1838,"For years, Apple taught us to unlock iOS devices by swiping on the lock screen from left to right. The company even patented this technology, and gave Samsung and other Android device makers plenty of headaches over this method of unlocking a smartphone. But in iOS 10, Apple is killing the gesture, as it has other plans in mind for the lock screen and the phone unlocking mechanism. Slide-to-unlock is dead, long live Press-home-to-open! DON’T MISS: HBO is trolling ‘Game of Thrones’ fans with a very stupid decision That’s the new gesture you have to learn: pressing the home button to open the iPhone or iPad. But as our Chris Mills discovered while testing iOS 10, you will encounter a rather silly behavior, at least in the first beta. Ever since Touch ID was introduced, it was simple: place your finger on the home button, without pressing, and your phone will open. Simple, right? Well, not simple enough for Apple! In the new beta, if you've touched the lockscreen at all, using Touch ID will unlock the phone, but not open it. Instead, you first have to scan your finger, and then hit the home button to unlock your phone. It's the opposite of what Apple has been training us to do for years, and it feels glitchy and bad. So why is Apple killing the iconic iPhone slide-to-unlock? Because keeping it would only offer users a confusing experience in iOS 10. swipte-to-unlock-press-home-to-open More See those dots below the ""Press home to unlock"" text in the image above? They suggest that additional actions are available on the lock screen by swiping left or right. Swiping from left to right brings up the widgets screen, but the gesture can’t do two things at once. That’s why you won’t be able to swipe-to-unlock. Swiping from right to left will bring up the camera app. In iOS 9, you need to swipe from the bottom right corner upwards to activate the camera app. After so many years of swiping-to-unlock the iPhone, this change will probably annoy plenty of long-time users, at least at first. If, however, you've been relying on Touch ID to unlock iOS devices, the transition will be easier, provided you don't have to press the button after your fingerprint is scanned to actually unlock it.

1839,"Alan Montecillo logged on to OkCupid and started filling out his profile. He wrote down his height (6 feet), listed his interests (podcasts, basketball, reading) and included photos of himself outdoors. But when Montecillo reached the section that asked for his ethnicity, he hesitated. Montecillo, whose parents are Filipino, was born in New York and spent 13 years living in Hong Kong. When he signed up for OkCupid in 2013, he was in Singapore but began using it more frequently when he moved to Portland, Ore., the following year. It was around then that he saw OkCupid’s data on race and attraction. Compared with black, white and Latino men, Asian men receive fewer matches and messages from women on the dating site. That’s not to say online dating can’t work for Asian men. It just means they often find themselves making an effort to improve their chances. Montecillo ended up including his ethnicity on his profile, but he removed it after an exhausting period where he received a response about once in every eight or nine messages. He asked himself: ""Would people notice [me] if I was a large bearded white guy who likes hiking? I don’t know. It’s just one of those things where ... you can’t help but wonder sometimes."" After nearly three years on OkCupid, Montecillo met his current girlfriend, who is Caucasian. His approach was to emphasize his interests (he and his girlfriend are both big fans of Radiotopia podcasts); and keep his profile short but interesting. He needed online dating only to ""work once,"" he says, and it did. In the process, Montecillo, 25, also learned to not judge himself based on others people’s standards. ""I feel like I’ve grown into being more socially outgoing and talkative, but I wasn’t always that way,"" he said. ""I think there was a long time where I felt ashamed, ashamed or self-conscious, or attributing me being single to the fact that I don’t have these qualities and I need to have these qualities in order to attract people. Even though intellectually I knew it wasn’t true, but emotionally [I was] blaming myself for not meeting a seemingly objective standard of what is attractive."" MC Maltempo, a 36-year-old Korean American who grew up in Golden, Colo., also met his significant other online. He first joined Match.com in 2006, but only started using it seriously in 2013. A little over a year later, Maltempo married a woman he met on the site. But dating — online or off — was hardly a smooth experience. Maltempo says women occasionally made assumptions about him based on his race. ""When [I was] dating non-Asians, sometimes they were interested in exotic factors that I’m not a white guy,"" he said. ""Maybe they’d talk about how they’re really into anime, manga or ‘Have you seen that scary Japanese or Korean movie?’ The media interests rather than culture interests made it kind of shallow."" The bias Asian men encounter in dating bleeds into other parts of their lives as well. Tao Liu, a doctorate student in counseling psychology at Indiana University, has measured how Asian American men experience gendered racism. [My boyfriend was intimidated by my sexual history. So I dumped him.] In a recent online survey of 900 Asian American men, Liu found that Asian men frequently feel stereotyped as lacking masculinity; they also said they’re perceived as undesirable and as too passive. Part of the problem, she says, is that the white American man has become the standard for what is attractive. It’s an image the media often reinforces. There are few Asian American male leads in Hollywood, and only recently have more Asian characters been cast as love interests. The TV shows ""Master of None"" and ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"" for example, stand out for pairing Asian men with white women. ""I know sometimes Asian men are not considered attractive, just because we don’t have many examples of Asian men in the media to be considered attractive,"" Maltempo said. ""Even if you give them a little bit of room in terms of looks, that still leaves a really high bar for Asian men to be considered attractive at all."" To improve his success rate on Match.com, Maltempo created a rule for himself. Rather than cast a wide net, he would message just one woman per week. This alleviated the feeling of being overwhelmed and helped him get to know the person he was interested in. Maltempo compared this approach to meeting people at a mixer, where you can gauge your chemistry with only one person at a time. ""It makes it seem like there’s a dialogue going on from the very beginning,"" he said. ""Dialogue rather than just messaging."" At first, Maltempo’s wife, Xue Jiang, was unimpressed by his messages. Compared with other men she met on Match.com, Maltempo was far less flirtatious and more direct. But after a friend urged Jiang, a 27-year-old native of China, to give Maltempo a chance, she realized that unlike some other people she was talking to, there was substance behind Maltempo’s messages. He was ""looking for a person who he wanted to spend a lifetime together with,"" Jiang said, ""instead of playing around.""",message just one woman per week
1840,"Wikipedia A new study has provided an updated theory about how the dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago. A paper published in the Scientific Reports journal puts forward the theory that a massive asteroid did indeed strike the Earth, but that its devastating effects were different than commonly thought, reports The Independent. Researchers – from Japan’s Meteorological Research Institute and Tohuku Univeristy – now believe the asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, hitting massive oil deposits and sending a blanket of thick black smoke into the atmosphere, engulfing the planet. The amount of sunlight fell by a huge 85 per cent, causing the Earth to cool by as much as 16 degrees Celsius on land for about three years. Also, rainfall would have fallen by roughly 80 per cent causing extreme and devastating droughts. The researchers wrote: Small mammals and reptiles could have lived underground where it is warmer – dinosaurs did not. These different habitats would have been key factors in determining their extinction or survival. Wikimedia Experts had previously wondered why dinosaurs had died out while other reptiles – like the ancestors of crocodiles – had survived. The accepted theory was that the impact caused vapours of sulphuric acid in the sky, which reflected sunlight, leading to global darkness, near-freezing conditions and widespread acid rain. However, the team from Tohuku said: If this had occurred, crocodilians and various other animals would have also gone extinct. It is thought that only 12 per cent of life on land lived through the aftermath of the asteroid impact, whereas 90 per cent of freshwater species managed to survive. Dark times.

You'd never know from her relaxed disposition and smiling face that at 12:30 p.m. when we arrived at her (adorable) West Village apartment, Jamie Stelter had already finished her work day reporting traffic on NY1 News -- which starts promptly at 5:08 a.m. You certainly wouldn't know that she had woken up two hours before that at 3:24 a.m., which she has been doing every weekday since 2010, when she joined the news team. While waking up at that hour may sound scary to some, Stelter maintains a sense of humor about it. ""I always say I'm the first person to use the hot water in the building, so it takes a little while for it to heat up,"" she laughed. Stelter's bubbly personality and witty banter with news anchor Pat Kiernan has turned her into a household name on the New York morning news circuit, meaning an early day -- every weekday. She finishes her final report at noon, heads to a workout class (Fly Barre is her current fave), runs a few errands, works on her food blog, cooks dinner for her and her new husband Brian (host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" and the second half of this super cute media power couple) and gets to bed early. DVF dress, Michael Kors shoes, DANNIJO earrings So, naturally, one has to wonder when she has time to do anything else, let alone explore her own personal style. And yet every morning, plenty of women look to her for fashion inspiration while they get ready for their day. While she admits that her look off-camera is way different than what she wears on, after 10 years in front of a green screen, she certainly has a handle on what works and what doesn't. ""It's definitely a balance of looking cute, and your age AND professional. While staying just trendy enough,"" she says. For Stelter, comfort is key both on- and off-camera. ""I never wear heels. I own one pair that I wore to my wedding, and that's it,"" she admits, but saves her more eclectic style for nights and weekends. Showing off her impressive boot collection, she revealed her mantra when it comes to fashion: ""Be comfortable, be yourself, and don't knock the cowboy boots till ya try 'em,"" stressing the importance of ""doing you -- and not what the magazines tell you to do."" So, what are some shortcuts she has picked up over the years of an early morning routine? ""I pick out as many outfits as possible on Sundays and I never change my mind the morning of."" Sound difficult? Maybe so, but having no room to adjust also presents the opportunity to try something new that you may not have tried otherwise. ""You just have to do it,"" she says. And of course, no routine would be complete without some favorite products. Stelter swears by Somme Institute's face regimen, and is a self-proclaimed ""NARS junkie"" when it comes to her makeup -- admitting she ""doesn't know how she ever lived without"" their tinted brow gel. The ""Uniform"" -- Theory top, Madewell jeans, Vintage boots, DANNIJO earrings Waking up when some (night owls) are going to sleep is not for everyone, but so far, for Jamie, it has worked. ""There's something about morning TV that I'm really well-suited for. I could be on the evening news, but I wouldn't be able to show any personality,"" she says. ""Plus --there's something about waking people up in the morning that's really special,"" adding, ""the day I stop liking it is the day I stop doing it.""

Sure, fans might be able to tell you every costume she's ever worn, but there's a private side to Madonna that not many get to see. When it comes to her life as a mother, this is especially true. But according to sources, Madonna's role as a mother is not as chill and free-spirited as you might think, and it's put some serious strain on her relationship with her children.

1853,"A sign hangs above at the Amazon.com Inc. fulfillment center in Hemel Hempstead, U.K., on Wednesday, Nov. 25, 2015. Wal-Mart and Amazon’s toy pricing was almost equal on a three-week average leading into the holiday season, as both companies continue to provide the most competitive prices in the marketplace. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Despite being such an enormous company, and an important name in the music space for years now, Amazon.com has been fairly quiet on the streaming front. Now, it looks like that is about to change. According to a report published by Recode , the company is looking to dive headfirst into the highly competitive streaming music industry in its own way. Sources say that Amazon is looking to launch a new streaming service in the coming months that would come with the discounted price of only $5 (or potentially even $4), but as is the case whenever anything seems too cheap to be real, there is a catch. The streaming platform and all of the music offered on it would only be playable via Amazon’s Echo device, which the company has made a priority ever since it launched just over one year ago. Apparently, Amazon has yet to get all of the major labels to sign off on the product, which isn’t shocking, considering that those that own the rights to music aren’t too keen to give it away for even cheaper prices than they already are. While other big companies in the streaming music space have failed to be able to lower the cost of monthly subscriptions—including Apple, which reportedly wanted to offer its option to consumers for less than its rivals when it first launched—Amazon may be able to get the three majors on board with this plan, since unlike paid tiers on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, this new product wouldn’t allow users to store tracks and albums on their phones, essentially replacing downloads entirely. This new Echo-specific idea isn’t the only project that Amazon reportedly has in the works when it comes to streaming. It’s been known for some time that the company has been prepping a more traditional new product that would compete with the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, likely for a $10 a month subscription fee. Not much is known about what Amazon has been cooking up, but hopefully, the company brings something new to the table, as opposed to adding another option to an already crowded space.",only be playable via Amazon’s Echo device
1854,"For Obamacare to work, it needs young adults. A new Gallup poll serves as a useful reminder that young adults need Obamacare too. Nearly one in four 18-to-25-year-olds lack health care coverage, according to the poll, released Thursday. That’s the highest rate since late 2011. But it's still lower than the share that lacked health insurance before an Obamacare provision kicked in in March 2010, allowing Americans to stay on their parents' health insurance until they are 26. These uninsured young adults now face a choice between signing up for Obamacare and paying a monthly fee for health care coverage, or risk going without health insurance and pay a fine that in some cases could be less costly than the coverage. The deadline to sign up is March 31, 2014. White House officials believe that this group needs to sign up for Obamacare in order for the program to be successful, according to the Washington Post. Without them, the health care exchanges will instead fill up with the other kinds of people that typically lack coverage -- older or more sickly patients who are often denied insurance because their needs are so expensive. If that happens, premiums for those using the exchanges, a core part of Obamacare, will soar to sky high levels. And if that happens, the law could fail, some experts say. Even before the launch of the now infamous HealthCare.gov, Obamacare was a tough sell for young people, precisely for the reasons that the program needs them. Spry 20-somethings typically don’t require much in terms of care, so it may be hard to convince them it’s more cost effective to pay potentially hundreds of dollars a month for a service they may not need instead of just paying a fine. Of course Obamacare supporters will try. Oh boy, will they try: But there are probably more compelling reasons than potential lost beer money to sign up. For one, most Americans under the age of 25 will probably qualify for health care subsidies through the law, making coverage relatively cheap, according to an op-ed by Matthew Segal, the head of Our Time, a young adult advocacy group. In addition, one of the main purposes of health care coverage is to help people avoid the crippling debt that can come from unexpected medical issues. Like falling during a keg stand for example.","signing up for Obamacare and paying a monthly fee for health care coverage, or risk going without health insurance and pay a fine that in some cases could be less costly than the coverage"
1857,"Screenshot of Myspace's current homepage The story of MySpace's rise, fall, and (so far failed) resurrection is a kind of case study for internet companies. In 2006, three years after it launched, MySpace became the most visited site in the US by some metrics, and it became known as a launching pad for musicians after artists like Calvin Harris, the Arctic Monkeys, and Lilly Allen got IRL famous after attracting attention on the social network. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought MySpace for a then-eye-watering $580 million. Everyone knows what happened next: Users migrated to Facebook en masse, MySpace's aesthetic became regarded as ugly and cluttered. In 2011, Murdoch unloaded the site for $35 million, describing his decision to buy (and then hang onto) MySpace as a ""huge mistake."" By then, the site was a punchline as well as a lesson in how quickly a site could become irrelevant. But today it embodies another aspect of online business culture: eternal optimism. The people currently in charge of the site imagine that with a little luck it could return to its current glory, even if no one else thinks so. ""We were trying to be everything to everybody, and we just stopped innovating,"" Linh Chung, who joined MySpace in 2007 as senior vice president of tech operations, told VICE of the site's downward slide. ""That was the main reason we fell from grace."" In 2013, the site, now owned by Justin Timberlake and Tim Vanderhook's Specific Media Group, relaunched. Specific Media, which is part of Viant, is known for being a pioneer in the field of behavioural-tracking technologies, which underpin most online advertising. Featuring a sleek new design and surrounded by a whirlwind of publicity and TV advertisements, MySpace 2.0 drew 31 million unique visitors to the site in two weeks, though many of those people might have been drawn in by the site's premiere of Timberlake's first single in seven years. Many old MySpace features like private messaging and customizable background designs had been dropped. The idea was to pivot into being more focused on music, along the lines of Pandora, Spotify, and even Pitchfork. It didn't take long before pretty much everyone considered the new MySpace to be a bust. Today, the site looks like just another content portal filled with listicles and aggregation. User can log in through their Twitter and Facebook accounts, and Vevo supplies most of the featured music videos. But the punchline is that rather than fading away, MySpace is doing better than ever, according to some numbers. In 2014, its traffic grew more than 400 percent, hitting nearly 30 million unique visitors in December. And Viant CEO Tim Vanderhook is talking about a comeback. ""During the past four years, the total number of users ever to be registered on MySpace crossed 1 billion, which is something very few platforms have achieved,"" Vanderhook told VICE. ""Because of that, we've felt the site has far more longevity than people believe."" There's one thing that MySpace has that few other sites can boast: lots of email addresses. ""Our strategy is really simple,"" Vanderhook says. ""Every time we have something relevant to say or offer, we leverage our archive of registered users and email aggressively."" ""Having a direct relationship with that many users means we aren't reliant on Google's search algorithm or Facebook's newsfeed to pull in traffic like many popular forms of media today,"" Vanderhook continued. ""We can simply send an email to a billion users at a moment's notice when we're ready to launch something and entice them to check out what we're offering. And with the information we possess on people, we have a much greater ability to reach out and be relevant to them again."" Vanderhook has been using such tactics to drive former users back to the site since 2013, and strongly rejects suggestions that the company is simply spamming people. ""It's personalized content that's tailored to each user,"" Vanderhook said. ""And the better that we get at that, the more traffic we're seeing."" It's not just the rise in traffic that's kept Vanderhook interested in MySpace, but also the personal data from all those registered users that can be turned into revenue. For example, the vast mountain of data enabled Vanderhook to launch Viant's new Advertising Cloud product in the UK in September, a tool that helps the advertising technology company's customers (advertisers and marketers) identify consumer bases and push targeted ads using details about registered users' locations, incomes, the number of children they have, and more. (Since many users haven't touched their accounts in years, a lot of this information is out of date.) But Vanderhook says he's not merely interested in milking MySpace's historical data for profit. He genuinely wants to revive the social media network. He mentions streaming services, connected TV, radio products, all supposedly in development, though launch dates and specifics remain ambiguous. Both the CEO and Jon Schulz, Viant's chief marketing officer, used familiar Silicon Valley buzzwords like mobile, connectivity, and video advertising when discussing the future of MySpace. Vanderhook has full faith that ""the company that gets it all right will become the biggest."" Few would bet on MySpace being that company given its past of false starts and miscues. But despite the doubters, the MySpace team remains bullish. As they know better than most, digital audiences are fickle and technological advances can render entire empires useless in an instant. While Google and Facebook seem almost invincible, Vanderhook remains convinced that it's a matter of when, not if, they decline. ""At some point things start to become old and fail,"" he says. ""With mobile devices becoming the dominant form of web browsing, if someone creates a popular voice-activated search engine, then Google.com could be out very quickly. These risks are real and they can happen far faster than people think."" It seems unlikely that MySpace will be able to return to its former glory, but the fact that the site has stayed afloat in one form or another for 12 years in a feat in and of itself. It might never be truly resurrected or evolve into something new, but instead sort of just drift along forever, the web equivalent of an old hotel with a fading sign. ""Can MySpace become as successful as it was before? It will probably be in a new shape or form, driven by a new music or TV platform, but absolutely,"" says Vanderhook. ""The world is very different today and we've made huge traction with something that was not just dead but dead and buried six feet under. And we've been resurrecting it ever since.""",MySpace is doing better than ever

1865,"Dropping your phone into a fluid-carrying vessel, whether that be a swimming pool, a pond, or a (hopefully otherwise empty) toilet, is a profoundly irritating event, and one that many phones tend not to return intact from. There are normally two options at this point: sticking your phone in some rice, which can suck out the water, or swearing profusely and sulking. According to phone company Gazelle, there is a third option, so long as you own a cat or kitten. No, despite their smarts, your feline companions themselves won’t be able to help you – in fact, they probably don’t care about your technological predicament. As it turns out, a specific type of cat litter is more effective at saving your phone from a watery death than rice. In a post entitled ""The Truth About Rice, the Galaxy and Everything,"" which definitely oversells itself, Gazelle explains how its dedicated team of phone revivers purposefully drowned nine unfortunate smartphones before attempting to resurrect each one via different methods, including rice, instant oatmeal, pearly couscous, regular cat litter, and crystal kitty litter – the last of which is silica gel, the dehydrating agent found in little packets inside many electronics packages. The company recommends that you shake as much of the water out of your phone first, allowing it to briefly air dry, then place it in a bag of crystal cat litter for as long as possible. They suggest that it takes several days for this to work, so the wait promises to be nail-biting. If, however, your phone still isn’t operational 48 to 72 hours after the clumsiness occurred, then you may want to buy yourself a new phone.

1872,"Niantic Is Finally Handing Out Permanent Bans To Pokémon Go Cheaters Due To This Reason Niantic has finally gone on the war path. The company has begun issuing permanent bans to any and all who they catch cheating, either via systems such as Pokevision or using bots to play the game for them. The reason for Niantic’s change from soft bans is due to an outcry from the Pokemon Go community that cheaters are ruining the game for everyone. The Pokemon Go Reddit page has a number of threads filled with people sharing their grievances with people who don’t play the game properly. This thread in particular has over 500 comments discussing the damage bots are having on players’ experiences. Right at the top, Redditor bbqk says, ""If bans don’t roll out before trading comes. There’s really no point for me to play anymore."" Another Redditor, farrellykw, linked an Imgur photo of a guy who he claims reached level 35 in a week using bots and spoofs, and has an entire team of ridiculously strong Dragonites at his disposal. Source: Reddit Source: Reddit Many of the other comments follow the same theme. It seems as though people are just fed up with having all their hard work be for nothing when people can overtake their progress in no time at all. So we know that people don’t like cheaters. The next point to consider then is why are people cheating in the first place? There are a number of reasons for this. Some people could live outside of areas with a lot of Pokemon activity, and so they need to ""cheat"" in some way in order to make the game playable. With all the hullaballoo that’s been occurring recently with the nearby function and the Pokemon appearance rate being lowered, a number of people probably took to cheating in order to keep the game fun for them. On the other hand, some people just want to be the best without putting much effort it. Others, still, just like to mess with people. For those that live in rural areas, cheating could be justified to be a legitimate way to play the game. Pokemon Go’s fun relies on being near a lot of Pokestops and gyms to make progress and have something to aim for. Without that, there’s not much point to play. However, not even rural areas are safe from cheaters. Another Reddit thread details the story of Xuan 135 . They state that where they live is quite rural, and has only one gym and two Pokestops. This situation was fine until botters started appearing overtaking the gym with unbeatable Pokemon. This significantly ruined the fun for everyone that played where he lived, taking away the little they could get out of the game without cheating. Despite the minority amount of players that may genuinely benefit from cheating, the majority of people doing this appear to just be making the game worse for everyone. Niantic’s efforts to perma-ban cheaters seems to be majorly supported by the community. Although the amount of people abusing the game is vastly lower than the amount playing by the rules, the community still feels that some sort of action needs to be taken. Niantic’s website has options to report players suspected of cheating, allowing players to aid in clearing up the game from this type of activity. There have been a few innocent people caught up in the cross-fire from the banning, causing their games to appear with an empty map. There a few solutions to this problem for those suffering from this, but if they don’t work, you can appeal to Niantic directly in an attempt to become unbanned. Hopefully with the steps Niantic has taken against players abusing the game, more people can enjoy the game as it was made to be played. In addition, without the distraction of banning everything, Niantic can focus their efforts on improving the mechanics of the game so that it provides a better experience for all its users.",an outcry from the Pokemon Go community that cheaters are ruining the game for everyone
1876,"""Couples who fear slowing down don't have the ability to be as mindful and appreciative of being in the moment as those who are open to going at a slower speed,"" Bernstein tells WomensHealthMag.com. According to Bernstein, it’s pretty common for couples to fear slowing down, and the roots of of those fears can often be traced to what he refers to as ""emotional ghosts."" ""There are people out there who were brought up with a good deal of emotional chaos,"" Bernstein says. ""Perhaps they grew up in families with addictions, or emotional distance or neglect. Others may have grown up in emotionally volatile, overly reactive families."" Being haunted by those emotional ghosts can make us afraid of falling into the same patterns from our childhoods, Bernstein says. ""Staying at a frantic pace, for some individuals and couples, may keep them from feeling like that they are going to re-enter the ‘gravitational pull’ of past dysfunctional family dynamics."" Getting comfortable doing nothing together can be hard work, but according to Bernstein, it’s well worth the effort, since just sitting and talking with each other is a powerful way to forge a lasting connection—and because a constant flurry of activity can sometimes cover up serious relationship issues. ""I think sometimes couples numb themselves with lots of activity to avoid looking at the patterns that don't work so well or in the future could be unhealthy for them,"" says Bernstein. ""For example, I've seen many women, and at times men, afraid to disengage from the chaos of raising children because they don’t want to face the faulty, or even abusive dynamics of their marriages."" ""I think sometimes couples numb themselves with lots of activity to avoid looking at the patterns that don't work so well."" For younger/newer couples, Bernstein says it’s common for one or both partners to avoid facing unpleasant relationship dynamics by immersing themselves in their work lives. And while avoiding looking at those potentially hard truths might feel like it’s keeping your relationship together, it likely isn’t sustainable for the long term. ""An authentic relationship is truly the most healthy kind of relationship,"" Bernstein says. ""Couples that make it have the courage to talk about what works and does not work."" This doesn’t mean your relationship is inherently flawed if you both like to keep busy—just that it’s worth making sure you’re also comfortable sitting still together from time to time. Bernstein emphasizes that every couple’s needs are different, and that only the people in the relationship can truly know what’s best for them. ""Couples that make it have the courage to talk about what works and does not work."" ""I've known a few cases where couples would spend every opportunity they could together and be very happy,"" he explains. ""[But] forcing people to be in a pattern other than what they want to be in because it is ‘more healthy’ when what they're doing already worked for them makes no sense."" If you feel like your partner is afraid of slowing down, Bernstein recommends avoiding the phrase ""do nothing,"" and instead focusing on all that your relationship stands to gain—hopefully, expressing a desire to be close and to truly enjoy the quiet, intimate time you spend together will make your partner feel like they’re aquiring something instead of sacrificing other activities. ""Gratitude is the most undervalued path to emotional health,"" Bernstein says. ""Couples who have gratitude for being together, and don’t take each other for granted, will relish the time that they share. Gratitude for each other's love is a wonderful antidote for boredom.""","Getting comfortable doing nothing together can be hard work, but according to Bernstein, it’s well worth the effort, since just sitting and talking with each other is a powerful way to forge a lasting connection—and because a constant flurry of activity can sometimes cover up serious relationship issues."
1880,"In the wake of the devastating Uri Attack which took the lives of 17 of our javans, the nation was outraged and demanded a strong reaction. Such a reaction recently came from the United States Congress as it introduced a bold legislation which seeks to designate Pakistan as a terrorist state. Two American Congressmen have just introduced legislation in the US Congress to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism. The timing is important since it is just ahead of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech at the UN General Assembly. Several US Congressmen condemned the recent Uri attack and came out in support for India. One of the Congressmen who introduced the bill, also made the following statement. ""Pakistan’s reckless behavior in this regard is a serious security risk to its neighbors – and India unfortunately pays the price all too often. We condemn this tragic attack, as well as Pakistan’s support for many criminals like the ones who carried it out, and stand firm in our commitment to our friends in India"" This is the first time in many years that there are formal talks about designating Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism.

1883,"A 25-year-old student has just come up with a way to fight drug-resistant superbugs without antibiotics. The new approach has so far only been tested in the lab and on mice, but it could offer a potential solution to antibiotic resistance, which is now getting so bad that the United Nations recently declared it a ""fundamental threat"" to global health. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria already kill around 700,000 people each year, but a recent study suggests that number could rise to around 10 million by 2050. In addition to common hospital superbug, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), scientists are now also concerned that gonorrhoea is about to become resistant to all remaining drugs. But Shu Lam, a 25-year-old PhD student at the University of Melbourne in Australia, has developed a star-shaped polymer that can kill six different superbug strains without antibiotics, simply by ripping apart their cell walls. ""We’ve discovered that [the polymers] actually target the bacteria and kill it in multiple ways,"" Lam told Nicola Smith from The Telegraph. ""One method is by physically disrupting or breaking apart the cell wall of the bacteria. This creates a lot of stress on the bacteria and causes it to start killing itself."" The research has been published in Nature Microbiology, and according to Smith, it's already being hailed by scientists in the field as ""a breakthrough that could change the face of modern medicine"". Before we get too carried away, it's still very early days. So far, Lam has only tested her star-shaped polymers on six strains of drug-resistant bacteria in the lab, and on one superbug in live mice. But in all experiments, they've been able to kill their targeted bacteria - and generation after generation don't seem to develop resistance to the polymers. The polymers - which they call SNAPPs, or structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers - work by directly attacking, penetrating, and then destabilising the cell membrane of bacteria. Unlike antibiotics, which 'poison' bacteria, and can also affect healthy cells in the area, the SNAPPs that Lam has designed are so large that they don't seem to affect healthy cells at all. ""With this polymerised peptide we are talking the difference in scale between a mouse and an elephant,"" Lam's supervisor, Greg Qiao, told Marcus Strom from the Sydney Morning Herald. ""The large peptide molecules can't enter the [healthy] cells."" You can see the SNAPPs (green) surrounding and ripping apart bacterial cells below: University of Melbourne While the results are positive so far, it's too early to get excited about what this could mean for humans, says Cyrille Boyer from the University of New South Wales in Australia, who wasn't involved in the research. ""The main advantage seems to be they can kill bacteria more effectively and selectively [than other peptides]"" Boyer told Strom, before adding that the team is a long way off clinical applications. But what's awesome about the new project is that, while other teams are looking for new antibiotics, Lam has found a completely different approach. And it could make all the different in the coming 'post-antibiotic world'. That's what she's hoping, anyway. ""For a time, I had to come in at 4am in the morning to look after my mice and my cells,"" she told The Telegraph. ""I wanted to be involved in some kind of research that would help solve problems ... I really hope that the polymers we are trying to develop here could eventually be a solution.""","star-shaped polymer that can kill six different superbug strains without antibiotics, simply by ripping apart their cell walls"

1888,"When a police officer in South Carolina responded to a 13-year-old boy’s phone call, he never expected what would happen next. 13-year-old Cameron Simmons made a distressed call to the Sumter Police Department. Officer Gaetano Acerra was the man who paid the boy a visit at his home. In a one-on-one meeting with Cameron, the officer learned the distraught child wanted to run away from home. He said his mother was yelling at him for playing his older brother’s video games. But Officer Acerra soon learned the issue was much deeper than that. Cameron led the officer inside his house, and then into his bedroom. His room was completely empty. His clothes were thrown in a trash bag. He didn’t even have a bed. The officer learned Cameron’s mother fell on hard times after having to make an unexpected move from Texas to South Carolina to care for a sick relative. That’s when Officer Acerra did the unthinkable. Touched beyond belief, he totally went beyond the call of duty. Cameron, his brother and his mom had no idea that Officer Acerra was busy organizing a major surprise. He spent weeks gathering items for the family — and putting together a complete bedroom for his new friend Cameron. With the help of his brother, Acerra loaded up and dropped off a brand new desk, chair, television, bed and Wii game system for Cameron. He also gave Cameron’s brother a full bedroom and an air hockey table for them to play together. Cameron was shocked to tears. His grateful mother was in complete disbelief. And after the story went viral, people from all over the world began making contributions to the family.","With the help of his brother, Acerra loaded up and dropped off a brand new desk, chair, television, bed and Wii game system for Cameron."
1891,"Last week, a new scourge took hold of humanity. People wander, zombie-like, heads glued to phones, swiping, tapping, and occasionally glancing up to compare their real-world surroundings to what they see on their phones. Some, unaware of physical reality, fall in holes; others wander into the thick of an armed robbery. But no matter what, they're on a mission: they're hunting Pokémon. The new Pokémon game for smart phones, Pokémon GO, puts digital Pokémon in the real world. In GO, Pokémon hunters have to catch those wacky little monsters in public spaces, and train them against other players at real-life locations that stand in for Pokémon Gyms. Pokémon might be hiding in a public park, a bus stop, or places of business and private homes, and people looking for Pokémon GO have started to congregate wherever the game takes them.

1894,"So Yevette drove home, donned a plaid shirt, black pants, baseball hat and sneakers and topped it off with a false mustache. Then they went back to school, and Elijah was, wonderfully, able to take part in the Donuts with Dads event. Yevette took to Facebook later that day and posted, ""Today at my son Elijah’s school, as I was dropping him off I asked him why there were so many cars. He said [it was] Donuts with Dad, so we quickly went back home cause I wasn’t about to let him miss out."" ""I know seeing other dads with their kids isn’t easy for mine,"" she continued. She pragmatically added, ""But it’s life, at least I can do whatever it takes to put a smile on that face."" Yevette also shared pictures of her and her son with his friends at school. Of course, the pictures quickly went viral, not only among single parents in a show of solidarity, but also with dual parents lending their support. The story that the casually snapped selfie outside of the school does not tell, however, is that the mustachioed Yevette was filled with nerves. But seeing the beaming smile across her son’s face reminded her of why she was doing what she was doing. After all, she didn’t want to see Elijah miss out on anything just because her kid’s dad isn’t a part of their lives. So, with the pull of donuts apparently too strong for the Vasquezes to miss out on, they walked proudly into the school, Yevette wearing an outfit that Elijah had helped to assemble. However, the youngster’s advice didn’t end with the wardrobe. In fact, Yevette told Inside Edition, ""He kept saying, ‘Walk like a man, mom. Walk like a man.’"" Elijah may have been on the receiving end of some jibes from some other students, but he didn’t care – he and his mom were in it together, and the smile on his face said it all. In fact, far from being embarrassed, he was happy that his mom went that extra mile just so he didn’t miss out on the event. Most of the responses to the Facebook post, from fellow lone parents, dual-parents and those raised in a single-parent family, were positive too. Though Yevette did sense a slight bit of discomfort from some dads that morning, she later told CNN, ""Most of the dads thought it was really cool."" One commenter on Facebook summed up the feelings of many when they wrote, ""I don’t know you, but what I do know is your son’s face tells it all! He loves you and this was a great thing you did. He might not have it all but he has everything in you. You’re amazing!"" Many praised Yevette for playing both roles, while others acknowledged the strong values she instilled in her son. Another commenter wrote, ""When he has a family of his own I have no doubt in my mind he will remember this moment and strive to be the best dad he can be."" The idea behind running initiatives such as Donuts with Dad is to get parents more involved with their kids. And while some critics may suggest that, for the sake of those who are left out, it’s something that shouldn’t happen, Yevette herself disagrees. Speaking with Eye Opener TV, Yevette said, ""I’ve gotten a lot of comments saying they should take these days away. I don’t agree with that at all."" Instead, she suggests a brother-sister day so that these kids feel they have ""every opportunity that everybody else does at school."" Yevette’s Facebook post so far has been shared more than 6,500 times, garnering more than 22,000 reactions. Yevette has also received messages of support from people from all over the world. The story has even run on major news outlets such as ABC, Today and CNN. All Yevette wanted, however, was a bit of fun so that her kid didn’t miss out like so many times before. She told CNN, ""I saw that same sad look on his face and I didn’t want that. I wish I would have done it sooner."" And with two younger sons, she may get the chance to do it again.","So Yevette drove home, donned a plaid shirt, black pants, baseball hat and sneakers and topped it off with a false mustache."

Two deputies with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office — a department that has plenty of experience with animal-related calls — responded Tuesday. The bear had somehow entered and locked itself inside the car, and the deputies couldn’t figure out how, the department said in a statement. ""No windows were broken. The door handles weren’t the kind you lift up. And yet somehow this medium-sized bear managed to open a door, crawl inside and close the door behind him,"" according to the department. ""Deputies could tell by all the moisture on the windows that he’d clearly been inside for a while. ""Given the size of the bear, they also wondered if there was a mama bear nearby."" The bear does look kind of small, though large enough to inflict some serious auto damage. As one deputy approached the car, the bear clawed at the window. Uhhhhhhhhh, TOO CLOSE! (Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office) ""Yeah, stay away from me, bear,"" the deputy can be heard saying in the video. ""He’s clawing at stuff. I hope he doesn’t hit the latch."" The deputies eventually decided the safest thing to do would be to pop open the hatch. But the door wouldn’t open with the key fob button, the department said. So one deputy had to manually open the car’s door. As in, be physically close to a Subaru with a distressed bear trapped inside. Another deputy stood nearby with a shotgun — ""just in case,"" the department said.

Middle-age white Americans with limited education are increasingly dying younger, on average, than other middle-age U.S. adults, a trend driven by their dwindling economic opportunities, research by two Princeton University economists has found. The economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, argue in a paper released Thursday, March 23, 2017, that the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with high school degrees or less has triggered broad problems for this group. (AP Photo/Mike Groll, File) WASHINGTON (AP) -- Middle-age white Americans with limited education are increasingly dying younger, on average, than other middle-age U.S. adults, a trend driven by their dwindling economic opportunities, research by two Princeton University economists has found. The economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, argue in a paper released Thursday that the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with high school degrees or less has triggered broad problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or afflicted with poor health. ""This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,"" Deaton said in an interview. ""The labor market has very much turned against them."" Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school degree. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. ""The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,"" Deaton said. Case and Deaton's paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in mortality among middle-aged whites. Since 1999, white men and women ages 45 through 54 have endured a sharp increase in ""deaths of despair,"" Case and Deaton found in their earlier work. These include suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths such as liver failure. In the paper released Thursday, Case and Deaton draw a clearer relationship between rising death rates and changes in the job market since the 1970s. They find that men without college degrees are less likely to receive rising incomes over time, a trend ""consistent with men moving to lower and lower skilled jobs."" Other research has found that Americans with only high school degrees are less likely to get married or purchase a home and more likely to get divorced if they do marry. ""It's not just their careers that have gone down the tubes, but their marriage prospects, their ability to raise children,"" said Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2015 for his long-standing work on solutions to poverty. ""That's the kind of thing that can lead people to despair."" It's not entirely clear why these trends have affected whites much more than they have African-Americans or Hispanics, whose death rates are improving. Case and Deaton note that many Hispanics are ""markedly better off"" than parents or grandparents who were born abroad, enabling a greater sense of optimism. African-Americans, they add, may have become more resilient to economic challenges given their long-standing disadvantages in the job market. The data is clear, though: In 1999, the death rate for high school-educated whites ages 50 through 54 was 30 percent lower than the death rate for all African-Americans in that age group. By 2015, it was 30 percent higher. The educational split is also growing. Even while the death rate for whites without a college degree is rising, the rate for whites who are college graduates is falling, Case and Deaton found. Americans with less education are also faring much worse when compared with adults in other countries, Case and Deaton concluded. Death rates in Europe for people with limited education are falling — and in most countries, they're falling faster than death rates for those with more education. For those reasons, Case and Deaton discount the notion that government disability benefit programs are responsible for some of these problems by enabling more Americans to stop working. Social welfare programs in Europe are typically more generous yet haven't caused a rise in death rates. Given the long-running nature of these trends, many of which stem from the 1970s, reversing them could take years, Case and Deaton write. But there are immediate steps that could be taken, Deaton said in the interview. Routine prescriptions for opioids should be cut back. And, ""Europe has a much better safety net than we do, and they're not seeing the same sort of problems as we are,"" he said.","They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or afflicted with poor health"

1901,"What wasn't available for his son may now save other kids. In 2008, 1-year-old Noah Shaw was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer called retinoblastoma. By the time he received the diagnosis, the cancer had progressed and the treatment plan was extremely intense. Months of chemo and radiation followed, and Noah had to undergo surgery to remove his right eye to keep the cancer from spreading to his brain. That's a lot to go through in your first year of life. As worried parents often do, Bryan and Elizabeth Shaw wondered if there were any missing warning signs that would have helped get Noah's diagnosis sooner. They remembered the photographs that first raised concerns. Instead of the usual red dot of a pupil, they had noticed one of Noah's eyes appeared different from the other. Being a scientist himself, Bryan wanted to see if he could track down when that difference first appeared. Bryan and Elizabeth turned to Noah's baby pictures to see how early this symptom showed up in photos before he was diagnosed. Lo and behold, a clear warning sign is exactly what they found. It's all about a white reflection that appears in the eye in photos with a camera flash. Blood vessels in the back of the eye will normally reflect red, but if there is a tumor or other issue present, the eye may appear differently. For Noah, that white glow first began appearing in photos when he was just 12 days old. The presence of a white glow in a child's eye can help determine whether a baby has leukocoria, an early indicator of an eye problem ranging from a refractive error, where a baby needs glasses, to a rare form of cancer, like in Noah's case. Noah, now a lively 7-year-old, is doing great. But Bryan never stopped thinking about how he could help other kids detect their eye problems earlier on. ""If I would have had some software in it telling me, 'Hey, go get this checked out,' that would have sped up my son's diagnosis and the tumors would have been just a little bit smaller when we got to them. There might have been fewer,"" Bryan told NPR. A chemist at the University of Baylor, Bryan decided to shake up his career path by exploring life as a software designer too. Bryan launched a free app called CRADLE that screens kids for leukocoria through their photos. Created with the help of Baylor colleagues and graduate students, the app is available on both iPhone and Android for free under the name CRADLE, which stands for ComputeR Assisted Detector of LEukocoria. Clever. The app can search your device for all photos that might contain white eye, given that leukocoria can show up inconsistently. It can also be used in real-time, snapping a photo through the app itself. Even better? The app is working. If the app finds a photo that could be a leukocoria, it recommends a visit straight to the pediatrician. ""Multiple families have used it to catch cancer in their children at such early stages — way before doctors — that the children received only laser treatment, no chemo, no radiation, no eye removal,"" Bryan said in an email to Upworthy. And while retinoblastoma itself is very rare — fewer than 12 out of 1 million children aged 0-4 will develop it — the app goes beyond to help with other eye problems. Shaw says ""white eye"" in kids is a symptom of a lot more than cancer. The app has caught Coats' disease, myelinated retinal nerve fiber layer, and a bunch of refractive errors (i.e., kids needing glasses). Posting and sharing photos is more than just a great way to connect and document life: It can now share valuable information about the health of a child's eyes. Bryan knows early diagnosis is key and parents see their kids a lot more than doctors do. While it's no substitute for being seen by an actual doctor, there is no question that this app can make a difference. ""From here, the software is going to get better,"" he told People. ""It's going to get more accurate as we collect more and more pictures to train it and make it smarter.""",It's all about a white reflection that appears in the eye in photos with a camera flash.
1908,"Drone swarms are about to change the face of modern warfare and some prophecy watchers find both the technology and name of the US Naval program behind it perhaps more than coincidence. The US navy recently demonstrated its Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) program by putting 30 drones flying together in perfect formation. These drones are launched from a special tube in less than a minute to create a vicious swarm designed to overwhelm an adversary autonomously. What makes the swarm unique is that any hostile aircraft, manned or unmanned, can be brought down by a single missile, but a swarm can take multiple hits and keep going. The drones are self-reconfiguring so that if one drone gets taken out, the others autonomously change their behavior to complete the mission. Several test simulations by the Navy have shown that drone swarms are consistently able to get past ship defenses that are geared towards shooting down single planes. This weakness means it makes sense to attack an enemy ship with a large number of cheap drones rather than one missile costing the same. Ironically, the best counter to drone swarm attacks being studied is a defensive drone swarm that can intercept the offensive ones. The aim is to have thirty or more drones flying together without having to be individually controlled, maintaining separation safely like a flock of birds. They are different from any other drone in that the operator does not control an individual aircraft, but pilots the whole swarm as a single unit. With manned aircraft and ships, the pilots life counts for a lot; but swarming drones are expendable and high ""casualties"" do not matter as much. This is a very different world to the dogfights that, historically, have made up modern warfare and could drastically alter the course of air warfare forever. Experts predict that as drone swarm techniques are perfected they will expand both in number and use. The Office of Naval Research has already experimented with a swarming configuration of 13 robotic boats on Virginia's James River. The boats were able to perform a variety of tasks to protect a high-value ship from incoming craft. Some prophecy watchers find it interesting that the Bible describes ""locust"" type creatures that play a significant role in end-time conflict. Revelation 9 describes them this way: The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like faces of men. They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running to battle. They had tails like scorpions and stings in their tails. Their power was to hurt men for five months. They had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek his name is Apollyon. (Revelation 9:7-11). What on earth was the Apostle John talking about? Exactly what kind of locusts did he witness on the Isle of Patmos where he received these prophetic revelations? The traditional interpretation is that these locusts could be evil entities and/or demonic physical or spiritual beings that will rise up out of the bottomless pit (abyss) to torment people and assume the characteristics of locusts (see today's article regarding CERN opening portals to different dimensions The traditional interpretation is that these locusts could be evil entities and/or demonic physical or spiritual beings that will rise up out of the bottomless pit (abyss) to torment people and assume the characteristics of locusts (see today's article regarding CERN opening portals to different dimensions here Others speculate they may be some form of grotesque variation of natural locusts as we know them today (perhaps even some form of chimeras or other DNA manipulation that scientists are now moving ahead with), or did John the Apostle perhaps see some advanced military aerial machinery that he lacked the words to describe? The revelations were given to him about 2,000 years ago when there would have been no way for him properly to describe 21st-century technological inventions that would follow many centuries later. Is it possible John was describing some type of technology in our day similar to the LOCUST program? Until recently, the most common technological correlation was that of helicopter gunships but, as insect looking drones and swarm technology become more common, this may present an interesting possible explanation.

The Hollywood Reporter announced Monday that star Elizabeth Banks will make her directorial debut with the film. Released in 2012, ""Pitch Perfect"" was an unexpected hit, starring Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow and Rebel Wilson as members of a college a capella group. Banks appeared in the film alongside John Michael Higgins as the announcers providing color commentary at the fierce singing competitions. ""Elizabeth originated the idea for 'Pitch Perfect' and was instrumental in making the first film such a huge success,"" Universal Pictures chairman Donna Langley said, according to THR. ""She brings an enormous amount of energy and experience to everything she works on and we’re thrilled that she is making her feature directorial debut on 'Pitch Perfect 2.'""

The 27-year-old is the cofounder of NeoLight, that has developed a portable phototherapy device for jaundice that can be used at home. ""It is quite an honour to be part of this list,"" said Kopparthi. After completing his schooling at DAV and Vanavani Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Chennai, Kopparthi went on to pursue engineering at Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College. In 2013, he moved to the US where he studied at the Arizona State University. A chance look at the condition of newborns at AIIMS Delhi by a friend led to them setting up the NeoLight. ""Typically, a newborn infant that is affected by jaundice needs to be given care in the next 2-4 days. Else, it could lead to brain damage or death. Across the globe, over 1290 infants become victims of damage or die every year,"" he said. The next 2.5 years went into the development of a product that would be effective and economical as compared to the bulky devices available in the market. With seed funding from the university and other investors, NeoLight has developed a black sleep slab (similar to a chopping board) which can run on battery or solar. ""It is 43% quicker than existing products and is almost 90% cheaper,"" he says. With 12 engineers across two offices in the state of Arizona, Kopparthi is targeting US and India as his primary markets. ""Africa has a big incidence of jaundice and we will go there soon,"" Kopparthi said. Kopparthi is not restricting himself to jaundice alone. They are now working on solutions for infant hypothermia and infant sleep apnea. ""We are not a company that is after money. We are a company that creates social good,"" said Kopparthi. Kopparthi will be in India next month with a single point agenda. ""I am visiting multiple schools, colleges and universities.

1914,"Stardust actor Charlie Cox has managed to gain worldwide recognition by his portrayal of Matt Murdock in Netflix’s Daredevil. The season 2 featured Frank Castle, aka The Punisher (Jon Bernthal), and Elektra (Élodie Yung) helping Daredevil in eradicating crime from the Hell’s Kitchen. Netflix is yet to announce the possible air date for Season 3, but it looks like even Charlie is not aware of the show’s future. Netflix’s superhero series was created by Drew Goddard, and it featured Charlie as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night. Season 1 was released on April 10, 2015, and managed to acquire praise for its action performances and the depiction of a darker theme. Season 2 was released on March 18, 2016, and featured new characters from Marvel’s Cinematic Universe. However, there is still no update from Netflix about the possibility of the third season. Earlier this year, Netflix hosted a two-day event in Paris. The event allowed the fans to get a chance to interact with the casts of Daredevil along with the casts of some popular series like House of Cards and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. According to the Independent, when it was asked to Charlie about the release date of Season 3, the 33-year-old star stated that he has no idea about it.

During his conversation with IGN at the Edinburgh Film festival, Smith stated that, after directing an episode of DC series The Flash, he is now interested in directing one episode of Season 3 "" ""I feel very at home in that Flash world, so much so that I’d love to do the others.

1919,"On top of all that, Pence has also written some very strange stuff about Disney movies. Considering we’re talking about a man who supports deporting undocumented children and has been a staunch opponent of marriage equality, having a bad take on a movie is obviously the least of his considerable flaws. Still, I’d argue Pence’s Movie Musings (trademark pending) give us valuable insight into the Indiana governor’s values. As uncovered by Buzzfeed over the weekend, Pence wrote an op-ed in 1999 after seeing Disney’s Mulan with his children, and the article ran on a website for the talk radio show he hosted at the time. Buzzfeed has republished the text in full along with a screenshot of the editorial. Here are some excerpts: Mulan is a fictional account of a delicate girl of the same name who surreptitiously takes her fathers place in the Chinese army in one of their ancient wars against the Huns. Despite her delicate features and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan’s ingenuity and courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal basis with her cloddish cohorts. Obviously, this is Walt Disney’s attempt to add childhood expectation to the cultural debate over the role of women in the military. I suspect that some mischievous liberal at Disney assumes that Mulan’s story will cause a quiet change in the next generation’s attitude about women in combat and they just might be right. (Just think about how often we think of Bambi every time the subject of deer hunting comes into the mainstream media debate.) There’s actually some debate over whether or not the character of Mulan was entirely fictional; the Disney movie was based on a 6th-century Chinese ballad which may or may not have been inspired by a real woman. Other than that, I agree with Pence on two things here—that someone at Disney may have hoped Mulan would send a message about gender parity (if not necessarily gender parity in the American military), and that movies and other media can influence ‘cultural debate.’ He loses me pretty quickly from there though: From the original ""Tailhook"" scandal involving scores of high ranking navy fighter pilots who molested subordinate women to the latest travesty at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the hard truth of our experiment with gender integration is that is has been an almost complete disaster for the military and for many of the individual women involved. When Indiana Congressman Steve Buyer was appointed to investigate the Aberdeen mess, he shocked the public with the revelation that young, nubile, 18 year old men and women were actually being HOUSED together during basic training. [...] Housing, in close quarters, young men and women (in some cases married to non-military personnel) at the height of their physical and sexual potential is the height of stupidity. It is instructive that even in the Disney film, young Ms. Mulan falls in love with her superior officer! Me thinks the politically correct Disney types completely missed the irony of this part of the story. They likely added it because it added realism with which the viewer could identify with the characters. ; that officers wore slogans with shirts like ""Women Are Property"" and ""I survived the third floor"" (a reference to The ""Tailhook"" scandal Pence references was a 1991 case in which over 100 U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers were alleged to have sexually assaulted—or engaged in other ""improper and indecent"" conduct with— 83 women and 7 men during a four-day conference. An investigation into the alleged incidents revealed a culture in which women were viewed as entertainment for male officers. T-shirts worn at the event telegraphed just that the report revealed that officers wore slogans with shirts like ""Women Are Property"" and ""I survived the third floor"" (a reference to the third floor of the hotel the conference was held in, which women were warned to avoid for fear of assault). The "" Aberdeen mess "" was a 1996 case in which 12 male officers were accused of sexually assaulting and raping women under their command. One officer was found guilty of 18 counts of rape involving six different women, as well as 29 other offenses. To hear Pence tell it, the assaults at Tailhook and Aberdeen were unavoidable—not because of rape culture or systemic lack of support for female officers , but because boys will be boys, especially when housed with ""nubile"" young women. Instead of teaching men how not to rape their fellow officers, it’s easier in Pence’s mind to just ban women from the military entirely. He went on to say, You see, now stay with me on this, many young men find many young women to be attractive sexually. Many young women find many young men to be attractive sexually. Put them together, in close quarters, for long periods of time, and things will get interesting. Just like they eventually did for young Mulan. There’s a lot going on here, and it’s all concerning. The power dynamics in the relationship between Mulan and Li Shang in Mulan were arguably imbalanced, him being her elder and superior officer. I actually agree with Pence that that’s an aspect of Mulan worth thinking critically about if, following his dubious logic for a second, Mulan is some sort of direct analogy for the U.S. military. concern trolling questioning them as a couple. However, it’s telling that in examining Li Shang and Mulan’s relationship he places the ‘blame’ on her, saying ""it is instructive that even in the Disney film, young Ms. Mulan falls in love with her superior officer!"" Assuming Li Shang is older than Mulan and not just a very manly teen, it is very squicky and concerning by modern standards that he romances his 16-year-old subordinate. Personally, I felt Mulan provided enough context for the relationship that it seemed like a positive portrayal, but I actually don’t fault Pence forquestioning them as a couple. However, it’s telling that in examining Li Shang and Mulan’s relationship he places the ‘blame’ on her, saying ""it is instructive that even in the Disney film, young Ms. Mulan falls in love with her superior officer!"" Pence insinuates ""young Ms. Mulan fall[ing] in love"" with Shang is comparable to the rapes and assaults at Tailhook and Aberdeen. That, and his later comment about ""many young women find[ing] many young men to be attractive sexually"" implies that assault in the military is just as much the result of young women being attracted to or in love with their commanding officers as it is about boys being boys. In other words, it’s victim blaming that romanticizes rape. As women take on a more significant role in the U.S. military, there is an essential conversation about rape and assault that needs to be had. Women could soon be required to register for the draft , but the military still needs to reform how it handles sexual assault cases— according to the Department of Defense , there are over 20,000 sexual assaults on service members each year, most of which go unreported for fear of retaliation. But the solution to that epidemic isn’t to ban women, anymore than banning women from campus is a reasonable long-term solution to campus rape. You can ban us from work, from school, from walking down the street alone at night, but eventually men will have to be alone with a woman—perhaps even a ""nubile"" woman—and I’d like to think that the inevitable conclusion to that meeting wouldn’t be, to quote Pence’s underwhelming words, things getting ""interesting."" While it may be worth critiquing the power dynamics at play in Mulan‘s romance and the movie’s pro-military message, it’s concerning to me that Pence came away from it apparently viewing rape as an inevitable consequence of women working alongside men. Granted, he wrote this review years ago, but I suspect he’s been too busy fighting LGBTQIA rights and restricting access to abortion to think of a more nuanced solution to sexual assault than ‘ban women!’ since.","From the original ""Tailhook"" scandal involving scores of high ranking navy fighter pilots who molested subordinate women to the latest travesty at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the hard truth of our experiment with gender integration is that is has been an almost complete disaster for the military and for many of the individual women involved.

1926,"A new ""heat test"" may provide a less invasive way to detect cervical cancer. In a study published in peer-reviewed journal PLOS One Wednesday, a team from the University of Louisville in Kentucky described a new cervical cancer screening method that can also indicate the stage of the cancer. So how does it work? Using some of the patient's blood plasma, researchers generate a plasma thermogram by heating the sample. Once the blood plasma is ""melted,"" it produces a unique signature based on proteins in blood. The signature then serves as an indicator, denoting whether the specific biomarkers for cervical cancer are present. The heat test also goes a step further and allows researchers to see the extent to which the cancer has spread. Lead researcher Nichola Garbett, Ph.D., said the key to screening for the cancer lies in the shape of each patient's individual heat profile. By comparing test results, doctors should also be able to adjust cancer treatments for each patient. ""We have been able to establish thermograms for a number of diseases. Comparing blood samples of patients who are being screened or treated against those thermograms should enable us to better monitor patients as they are undergoing treatment and follow-up,"" he said in a statement released by the university. Currently, doctors most often perform a Pap smear -- a procedure that involves analyzing cells collected from inside the cervix -- to detect abnormalities that could lead to cervical cancer. The invasive test may be completed in conjunction with a DNA test for human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection known to cause cervical cancer. Though further clinical research is required, the team is hopeful that the heat profiles can serve as a ""complementary diagnostic tool"" for cervical cancer screening, they write in the study. According to the Centers for Disease Control, cervical cancer used to be one of the leading causes of cancer death for women in the United States, but the number of deaths has decreased, thanks, in part, to a variety of screening methods. From 2003 through 2007, about two out of 100,000 women died per year as a result of the specific type of cancer, the National Institutes of Health reports.","A new ""heat test"" may provide a less invasive way to detect cervical cancer."
1931,"An 18th century woman named Mary Toft shocked all of the English countryside of Godalming, Surrey in 1726 after she gave birth to a multitude of...bunnies! Yes, rabbits! Apparently, Mistress Toft eschewed the traditional pulling-a-rabbit-out-a-hat trick, and decided to pull not only one....but several...out of her baby-hole. Mary Toft and one of her...children. The story began when a pregnant Toft, who was working in the fields with other women in her community, sighted a rabbit bounding from the undergrowth, and was filled with such longing for the furry, little creature, she could not think of anything but rabbits. A month later, she was delivered of a strange creature resembling a rabbit, but with its heart and lungs outside its body. It so alarmed her midwife, who immediately informed surgeon and man-midwife, John Howard. Initially skeptical, Howard examined Toft, and was shocked when the peasant women expelled a creature from her body made up of several animal parts, including the legs and guts of a cat, one leg of a rabbit, and the backbone of an eel. Fourteen days later, she delivered even more, this time full, perfectly-formed rabbits, bringing forth a total of six rabbits into the world, all of which were either dead, or died soon after delivery. Now imagine these furry fluffies as Mary Toft’s children, only dead. Her case took the countryside by storm, and news spread far and wide until a member of King George I’s court, Henry Davenant, took it upon himself to look into the matter. Howard, who had taken over the guardianship of Mistress Toft, had moved her to the larger town of Guilford, and offered anyone the chance to see Toft deliver a rabbit, or rabbit parts on demand, effectively making her a carnival freak of sorts. Mary Toft in action Eventually even the entire Royal Family of England heard of Toft’s strange story, and the king himself sent his own royal physician to examine her. Suspecting a hoax, royal surgeon, Cyriacuse Ahlers examined Toft and did not see any signs of pregnancy. Ahlers further took with him the alleged birthed rabbit parts to examine more closely, and found the cut portions appeared to have been sliced by man-made instruments. He further found straw and grains in the rabbits’ droppings. Toft was immediately placed under study by the country’s most imminent medical professionals, and a hoax was uncovered after a bribed porter was caught trying to sneak a rabbit into her chambers. It later turned out she had a miscarriage earlier in her actual pregnancy, and sought to fill in the void by filling her cervix as much as she was able, with rabbit and other animal parts, which her body then eventually expelled. So it was a hoax. Thought so... Not only was the medical profession of the period made subject of such mockery for having been made fools of, it gave an inkling about the depression and anxiety experienced by women who have lost their unborn children, which can descend to the point of mental illness.

1936,"Royal dogs expect only the best. And Queen Elizabeth ensures they get it when she cares for her favorite corgis. The Queen, 89, feeds them specially designed meals depending on their needs – and they are all served on silver platters. For their part, the dogs are content to wait their turn as they are handed their meals in order of seniority. Animal behaviorist and corgi trainer Dr. Roger Mugford says he has witnessed feeding time at the palace. ""Each dog had an individually designed menu, including an array of homeopathic and herbal remedies,"" he told the spring issue of the U.K.’s Town & Country magazine. ""Their food was served by a butler in an eclectic collection of battered silver and porcelain dishes. ""As I watched, the Queen got the corgis to sit in a semi-circle around her, and then fed them one by one, in order of seniority. The others just sat and patiently waited their turn."" She also can’t abide ""unkindness"" to pets, taking a ""very dim view of President Lyndon B. Johnson picking up his dogs by their ears,"" Mugford added. The Queen, who is believed to have owned dozens of corgis in her lifetime, currently has two, Williow and Holly. She also owns two dachshund-corgi crosses (known as dorgis), named Candy and Vulcan. One famous pet, Monty, was among those that trotted alongside her as she walked the palace corridor with James Bond‘s Daniel Craig in the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony mini-movie. Monty died soon after the Games. Last year, the royal s horse trainer Monty Roberts confirmed that the aging monarch didn t want to have any new young pets , so as not to leave any behind. ""When she’s talking about her dogs or her horses you see a completely different side to her: she relaxes,"" Mugford added.

Woah. Sounds kinky."" Not so much because most of the people you come across on social media think like they're 15 (I'd estimate maybe 35 percent do), but because the sex lives of Olympians is a topic that fascinates all of us, from the dude who will take any opportunity to post a Crying Jordan to armchair anthropologists who want to explore the deeper meaning behind whatever kind of things might be going on in Rio between consenting athletes. While there's no way of actually knowing how much sex is actually taking place in and around the Olympic Village, one thing is for sure: There are tons of really good-looking people in one place right now. There are gorgeous locals, tourists looking for a good time, divers, soccer studs. Oh, and Draymond Green and his famous penis. It's safe to assume, there's definitely going to be a lot of boning done a lot of different ways. But just how many dongs will go into places where a condom is necessary? The IOC estimated it at somewhere around 450,000, so they ordered up that many condoms, and have people like Eric going around the games just handing out rubbers, wishing people a pleasant evening, and going on his way. That number has grown significantly over the years, especially after the great Sydney rubber shortage of 20,000 when 70,000 condoms were ordered, but another 20,000 reserves were necessary midway through. People fuck at the Olympics, that's just a fact. You get a bunch of great looking people with flawless bodies, throw in a bunch of Greek imagery – and the dual aphrodisiac that is the ecstasy of winning, and the agony of defeat – and people get horny as hell. None of this is new. What is different, talking to people who have been to multiple games, is that Olympic attendees – both athletes and out of towners – seem to be having more fun in 2016 despite all the worries of Zika and crime. Of course, that could just be because they're in a place like Rio. The summer Olympics, more than the winter counterpart, is usually set in a more exotic location (Barcelona, Sydney, etc.), where there's sun, water and warmth. Sure, people may have been looking for a body to keep them warm in Sochi, but people are looking to party in Rio. Dating and hookup apps like Tinder and Grindr have the numbers to show it. So you have over 10,000 athletes, media, camera people, world-famous sex idiot Ryan Lochte, and 450,000 condoms. Basically you're giving each athlete, every rugby, basketball, and water polo player, about 45 rubbers each. Not all of those athletes will use any of those condoms, but that's the IOC telling them, ""If you're going to do it that much, do it safe,"" which is a pretty sex-positive thing for the IOC to say. Of course, let's not overlook that there are plenty of women into other women who don't need a condom to have fun in the sack. So that's even more sex right there. There's a chance that there is more sex going on in Rio over these two weeks than there is any other place on the planet. The Olympics might be the capitol of doing it. The general unspoken rule at the Olympics is the same one as a trip to Las Vegas: What happens in or around the Village stays in the Village. So there's really a chance we will never come close to knowing just how much sex takes place during the games. But just taking into consideration the condom count as the one solid number we have, it's fair to say that they're better off just having a bonfire with the sheets after everybody goes home.","While there's no way of actually knowing how much sex is actually taking place in and around the Olympic Village, one thing is for sure: There are tons of really good-looking people in one place right now."

1939,"Will S. For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They’ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read! What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character’s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you’ve tried on. It’s a fascinating insight into the world of reading. In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty, ""The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions."" Your brain does amazing things while you’re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people. This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment ""conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees)."" The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as ""mudbloods"") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry. What does this all mean? Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read –we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books– but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits? The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com: ""We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple..."" Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term ""literary fiction"" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that’s what it means in the context of their study). In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby. Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you’re not only becoming a smarter person, you’re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise. Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn’t be able to experience on our own! So after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. Take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. And in choosing your next book, make it a tough one. Your brain will thank you. Which book inspires you the most?",readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others

Since 1979, the federal government in the US has recommended daily flossing, but by law these dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, have to be supported by scientific evidence. Surprisingly—and without any notice—the federal government dropped flossing from its dietary guidelines this year, telling the Associated Press that ""the government acknowledged the effectiveness of flossing had never been researched, as required."" That’s a rather monumental revelation—especially considering how often we’re reminded to floss our teeth—and considering that the global market for dental floss is expected to reach almost $2 billion next year (with half of it in the United States). Flossing is supposed to protect us from gum disease, get rid of plaque, and prevent cavities, but we actually don’t know this to be true. During its investigation, the AP looked at the best research on the subject over the past decade, focusing on 25 studies in particular. The evidence for flossing, concluded the AP, is ""weak, very unreliable,"" of ""very low"" quality, and ""carries ""a moderate to large potential for bias."" AP national writer Jeff Donn reports: The two leading professional groups—the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Periodontology, for specialists in gum disease and implants—cited other studies as proof of their claims that flossing prevents buildup of gunk known as plaque, early gum inflammation called gingivitis, and tooth decay. However, most of these studies used outdated methods or tested few people. Some lasted only two weeks, far too brief for a cavity or dental disease to develop. One tested 25 people after only a single use of floss. Such research, like the reviewed studies, focused on warning signs like bleeding and inflammation, barely dealing with gum disease or cavities. Wayne Aldredge, president of the periodontists’ group, acknowledged the weak scientific evidence and the brief duration of many studies...Still, he urges his patients to floss to help avoid gum disease. ""It’s like building a house and not painting two sides of it,"" he said. ""Ultimately those two sides are going to rot away quicker."" Part of the problem, says Aldridge, is that many people don’t floss correctly. Instead of moving it in a sawing back-and-forth motion, we’re supposed to move it up and down the sides of our teeth. But flossing can also cause harm when it’s done incorrectly or too vigorously, damaging gums, teeth, and dental work. Sponsored The AP also found that manufacturers of dental floss are struggling to provide convincing evidence (which is hilarious considering they actually fund a lot of this research). Johnson & Johnson told the AP that floss helps remove plaque, but when the company was sent a list of contradicting studies, its spokesperson declined to comment. Similarly, Procter & Gamble claimed that flossing fights plaque and gingivitis, but its ""proof"" for this claim came from a two-week study that was deemed irrelevant in 2011 during a research review. All of this isn’t to suggest that flossing isn’t beneficial, but it’s clear that the science is seriously lacking. A dentist with the National Institutes of Health told the AP that it may eventually be appropriate to drop the floss guidelines, but only after more rigorous research is done. Until then, he advises that people should still floss, saying. ""It’s low risk, low cost,"" and adding ""We know there’s a possibility that it works, so we feel comfortable telling people to go ahead and do it.""","We know there’s a possibility that it works, so we feel comfortable telling people to go ahead and do it"
1941,"Lee County Sheriff's Office Does it even matter what this guy from Florida, 20-year-old Micah Dailey, was arrested for?

1942,"If you spend a lot of time looking at photos of Prince William and his 3-year-old son, Prince George (as we most definitely do), you might have noticed that the Duke of Cambridge often kneels down while talking to his son. He did it at Princess Charlotte's christening ... ... at a polo match for charity ... ... and with President Obama during a presidential visit to Kensington Palace. He was even scolded by the Queen for doing it at the Trooping the Colour event! The Queen might not have appreciated Prince William using this parenting technique in such a formal setting, but according to the experts, the Duke of Cambridge's squatting trick is one all parents could stand to steal. When the Duke of Cambridge crouches down to Prince George's level, he's able to look into the toddler's eyes. Experts consider this to be an ""active listening"" technique, People reports, and it can help children feel like what they're saying really matters to their parents. Child development expert Gill Connel writes in A Moving Child Is a Learning Child that the Duke of Cambridge's gesture can ""foster self-esteem in powerful ways while encouraging his children to communicate even more."" And isn't that sweet? Of course, listening to and talking with your child involves more than just squatting down to eye level. The Center For Parenting Education recommends that parents stop what they're doing and give a child their full attention when they're talking, Parent Herald reports. After all, positioning yourself to actively listen only does so much good if you aren't actually, you know, listening. So next time your child wants your attention, try crouching down and looking them in the eye while they talk to you. It's easy, it'll boost their self-esteem — and it's Royal Family-approved.

1945,"An international team of scientists from the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is investigating mysterious signal spikes emitting from a 6.3-billion-year-old star in the constellation Hercules—95 light years away from Earth. The implications are extraordinary and point to the possibility of a civilization far more advanced than our own. The unusual signal was originally detected on May 15, 2015, by the Russian Academy of Science-operated RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia, but was kept secret from the international community. Interstellar space reporter Paul Gilster broke the story after the researchers quietly circulated a paper announcing the detection of ""a strong signal in the direction of HD164595."" The mysterious star’s designation is HD164595, and it’s considered to be sun-like in nature with a nearly identical metallic composition to our own star. So far, a single Neptune-like (but warmer) planet has been discovered in its orbit—HD 164595 b. But as Gilster explained, ""There could, of course, be other planets still undetected in this system."" Decorated Italian SETI researcher and mathematician Claudio Maccone along with Russia’s Nikolai Bursov of the Special Astrophysical Observatory are the principal scientists working on the apparent discovery. They claim that ""permanent monitoring of this target is needed."" ""The signal conceivably fits the profile for an intentional transmission from an extraterrestrial source,"" said Alan Boyle, author of The Case for Pluto who reported the story for Geekwire. ""In any case, the blip is interesting enough to merit discussion by those who specialize in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence."" The signal’s strength indicates that if it in fact came from a isotropic beacon, the power source would have to be built by a Kardashev Type II civilization. (The Kardashev scale is used to determine the progress of a civilization’s technological development by measuring how much energy was used to transmit an interstellar message.) An ‘Isotropic’ beacon means a communication source emitting a signal with equal power in all directions while promoting signal strength throughout travel. In his acclaimed work ""Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations,"" Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev explained that a Type II civilization would be able to harness the energy of their entire host star. The most common hypothetical example of this would be a Dyson Sphere—which is a massive artificial structure that could completely encapsulate a star and transfer the energy to a nearby planet. Basically, if the signal was beamed out into the galaxy without aim or direction, that would require an enormous amount of power to actually be detected. But what if the signal was beamed specifically at our solar system? Well, that would require less energy and could indicate the presence of a Kardashev Type I civilization—meaning that it could be a highly technological, contemporary society that harnesses the solar energy emitted by its local star, much like our planet does with solar panels. This particular civilization’s social structure is theorized to be completely globalized and interconnected. ""The signal is provocative enough that the RATAN-600 researchers are calling for permanent monitoring of this target,"" said Gilster. And that’s exactly what is transpiring. As of last night, the SETI institute is diverting its Allen Telescope Array in northern California to investigate while their counterparts at METI International (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) will use Panama’s Boquete Optical Observatory. The detection of the mysterious signal and the ensuing investigations will be discussed at the IAA SETI Permanent Committee during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 27—the same day and location where Elon Musk will reveal his plans to colonize Mars.

Their argument centered on genetically modified "" golden rice ,"" a potentially life-saving grain.

1947,"Paper seems completely harmless, but anybody who has refilled a photocopier or thumbed too quickly through a book knows that this humble material harbours a deep, dark secret. Deployed properly, it can be a serious weapon: paper cuts are just the worst. There isn’t a whole lot of scientific research effort directed at understanding the pain of paper cuts, probably because nobody would sign up for a randomised, controlled study that involved a researcher intentionally inflicting this kind of torture on study participants. But according to Dr. Hayley Goldbach , a resident physician in dermatology at UCLA, ""we can use our knowledge of human anatomy to help us out here. It’s all a question of anatomy"". It’s all to do with nerve endings. To start with, there are lots more pain receptors embedded in your fingertips than almost anywhere else in your body. Though Goldbach is quick to point out, ""it would probably also hurt a lot if you got a paper cut on your face or in your genitals, if you can imagine that."" So while a paper cut on your arm, or thigh, or ankle might still be annoying, it would probably be more trivial than the intense fiery quality that finger-based paper cuts tend to have.  The cuts from paper aren't deep, but they can be extremely painful (Credit: iStock) You can actually prove this to yourself by employing a test that psychologists and neurologists use. Take a paperclip and unfold it so that both ends are pointing in the same direction. If you use it to poke yourself on your hands or face, you can probably perceive each of the clip’s two pointy ends individually. This is what’s referred to as ""two point discrimination,"" and because you have so many nerve endings in the skin in those parts of your body, the two points have to get really close to each other before you’re unable to tell them apart. But now try the same thing on your back, or your legs. Chances are the two points would have to be really far apart before you’re able to tell them apart. That’s because the distribution of nerve endings there is far less dense. "" The extreme pain felt when something injures your fingers is simply the result of evolution working as it should This actually makes a good deal of evolutionary sense. ""Fingertips are how we explore the world, how we do small delicate tasks,"" explains Goldbach. ""So it makes sense that we have a lot of nerve endings there. It’s kind of a safety mechanism."" It’s reasonable that your brain would devote more neural real estate to continuously monitoring possible threats to your hands, since they’re the main vehicles the body has for interacting with the world. If you come into contact with something extremely hot, for example, or sharp, it’s just more likely that you would interact with it using your hands. So the extreme pain felt when something injures your fingers is simply the result of evolution working as it should, providing a little extra encouragement for you to keep those hands safe. And then there’s the weapon itself. Do a quick Google search and you might become convinced that due to its porous nature, paper is home to a bacterial menagerie, just waiting to colonise your paper-inflicted wounds. But whether or not that’s true, the presence of bacteria and other microscopic beasties can’t explain the sensation of pain, at least not at the moment of cutting. Bacteria can lead to infections if wounds are left untreated, which themselves can be painful, but that takes a bit of time.  Paper edges may look straight, but they are in fact serrated, cutting through skin like a saw (Credit: iStock) But there is something to the idea that paper is a uniquely painful weapon. To the naked eye, it might seem as if a paper's edge is fairly straight and smooth. But if you were to zoom in, you’d find that paper is more akin to a saw than to a blade. So when a paper cuts open your skin, it leaves behind a chaotic path of destruction rather than a smooth laceration. It rips, tears, and shreds your skin, rather than making clean slice, as a razor or knife blade would do. And if that wasn’t enough, paper cuts are typically shallow – but not too shallow. ""They’re deep enough to get past the top layer of the skin, otherwise they wouldn’t hurt. The top layer of skin has no nerve endings,"" says Goldbach. "" The nerves that the paper revealed when it tore apart your skin continue to be exposed to the outside world But they don’t slice that deep into your body, which is perhaps why it’s puzzling that they should hurt so much. But it’s exactly for this reason that paper cuts are such a menace. A deeper wound would result in bleeding. The blood would clot and a scab would develop, beneath which the skin could go about healing free from the continued assault of the outside world. But the shallow wound of a paper cut doesn't offer such protection. Unless you take care to cover it up with a bandage and perhaps some antibiotic ointment, the nerves that the paper revealed when it tore apart your skin continue to be exposed to the outside world, and that only makes them angrier. Without the cushion of blood, pain receptors are left exposed to the elements, and unless you quickly bandage your paper cut, those neurons will keep on sending the alarm bell, warning your brain of impending disaster. That, after all, is their job.  The intense pain of paper cuts could be blamed on the sensitivity our hands and fingers (Credit: iStock) At least, that’s the idea. Nobody has ever proven that this is the case, but Goldbach agrees that it’s a reasonable hypothesis. Unfortunately, each of us is going to face the prospect of enduring a few paper cuts as we go about our lives. Luckily, the common saying is probably wrong. A thousand paper cuts would really really hurt, but it probably wouldn’t kill you.

1948,"While there are multiple ways to answer what causes snoring, let's just take a moment to address it. In some cases, it prevents your partner from sleeping. Even worse, prolonged snoring can lead to excessive tiredness and stress-related health issues. But what causes you to snore? Snoring happens when you can't move air freely through your nose and throat during sleep. This makes the surrounding tissues vibrate, which produces the familiar snoring sound. From an anatomical standpoint, snoring is caused by a partially closed upper airway (the nose and throat).  Everyone’s neck muscles relax during sleep, but sometimes they relax so much that the upper airway partly closes and becomes too narrow for enough air to travel through to the lungs.  Why do some people snore and others don't? Those who have enlarged tonsils, an enlarged tongue or excess weight around the neck are more prone to snoring. The sound itself is an indicator that the person who is snoring has a narrow airway. 40% of normal adults snore regularly, whether they realise it or not. What is snoring doing to your body? Not everyone, but a lot of people who snore also suffer from sleep apnea. Basically, it prevents you from getting the healthy sleep you need to lead a refreshed, energetic life. 3 in 10 men and 2 in 10 women who are habitual snorers suffer from this.  So if you snore and if you are sleeping next to someone who snores, take it as a sign that something is not right. Go see your doctor!

1951,"After an incredible three years out of professional mixed martial arts, the former UFC welterweight champion, Georges St-Pierre is finally ready to make his long awaited return to the UFC. Speaking on The MMA Hour, GSP revealed he is ready to fight again, if an adequate deal can be made with the UFC. ""I did a training camp to see where I’m at because I was training,"" St-Pierre told MMAFighting. ""Being in shape and being in fighting shape is something different. I did a training camp to push myself and go back to the same, highest level of competition. I didn’t fight, but I put myself through a training camp and I sparred and everything and I did it successfully. ""Now I know for a fact I could go back and fight if my management and the UFC get to an agreement. ""I always said I would come back for something big. Something that gives me the chills. Something that makes me excited."" Story Continued Below... Although no official timeline has been set by GSP for his return, he did indicate that we could see him in 2016. St-Pierre confirmed that his management team had been in communication with the UFC for a while about a new contract, however now that he has finished his training camp successfully, he wants talks to ramp up. ""They were talking and now I told them I had to do a training camp,"" St-Pierre said. ""I had little things things that were bothering me physically, I got over it and I did my training camp and I’m back. We’re waiting because a lot of things was going on — Rory (MacDonald) was fighting and there’s a rumor they are going to sale and all of that so we were waiting a little bit what was going on in the meantime before we talk to them again."" There are a number of possible opponents for GSP’s return, but one which he is certainly interested in, is current UFC middleweight champion, Michael Bisping. Both Bisping and St-Pierre are locked on 19 wins in the UFC (which is the record for most wins), making the matchup both a mouth watering title shot and history making fight. ""There’s two things that I’m very proud of — my welterweight title that I won and there’s another record that I hold for most wins in UFC history,"" St-Pierre said. ""Now I have someone who is challenging me in Michael Bisping. ""I do not believe if I fight him he would send me back to a movie set. Yes, he’s bigger than me, but I believe I have more skills, more athleticism, and a higher fighting IQ than he does. The world doesn’t revolve around me, but if it’s a fight that the fans and the UFC wants to make, they’ve got my number, they can call my agent no problem. We can organize to make it happen and make an agreement."" But if the Bisping fight can’t be done, he’s also interested in going up against superstars Conor McGregor or Nate Diaz. ""I love my sport and I still feel I’m at my best right now,"" St-Pierre said. ""The clock is running. I’m not getting any younger.

Contrary to popular belief, Glen says new projects are not a good indicator of whether or not a character doesn't make it on the HBO series. ""They've always been amenable to actors doing other work around it. Your guess is as good as mine as to whether Ser Jorah survives into the future. They keep us painfully in the dark, so well just have to see,"" he said. Even if this season could mark the end of Mormont, fans can take comfort in the fact that Glen's new show is a lot like ""Game of Thrones."" ""Cleverman"" is an Australian-New Zealand fantasy series about what happens when the world of mythology collides with our own. Like ""GoT,"" it explores class and politics, and there's even some monsters and heart-eating, too. Yum, right? Though ""Cleverman"" may not have the same budget as ""Thrones,"" Glen says a big similarity is that the show's supernatural aspects enhance the story rather than distract from it. ""I think in 'Cleverman,' there are these supernatural elements in it, but you never get to the point where they bounce you out of the story and say, 'Well, I don't really believe that situation,'"" he told HuffPost. Glen enjoyed shooting and would be totally up for Season 2 if it happens, which is fine with us. If we don't have to worry about Jorah, then now our ""Cleverman"" watch begins. UPDATE: ""Cleverman"" has been renewed for Season 2, according to Deadline. Production for six more episodes will begin later this year.","Does Glen's participation in ""Cleverman"" hint at Jorah's fate? ""I don't think you can draw that conclusion,"""
1956,"Companies spend lots of time and money trying to climb the ranks of the SERPs, but fully maximizing how many people click on your results can be a difficult undertaking. In an apparent effort to do just that, online travel giant Expedia is employing an unusual tool: Emojis in some of its page titles. Google has supported the display of Emoji characters in search results on mobile since 2012, but only added desktop support last month. Following that, Search Engine Land was tipped off to the fact that Expedia has added Emoji characters to the titles of some but not all of its pages. For example, a search for ""miami hotels"" returns an Expedia page that has a bed Emoji before the text page title, while a search for ""portland flights"" includes an Expedia page that has an airplane seat Emoji before the text page title. Interestingly but perhaps not surprisingly, it appears that Expedia has excluded some of the United States' largest cities from its Emoji test. Results for searches related to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, for instance, don't have the Emoji page titles. Will it work, and long-term? Search Engine Land's Barry Schwartz says he expected companies to experiment with Emoji page titles ""hoping the additional imagery in the search results would lead to more visibility and a higher click through rate."" And, at least initially, there's good reason to believe it will have some effect. After all, results with Emojis do stand out, particularly in browsers that display them in full color. In some browsers, however, the Emojis are solid blue and don't look nearly as appealing. Assuming that use of Emojis doesn't hurt a page's SEO and companies experimenting with them see CTRs increasing, the SERPs could become inundated with Emojis as everyone seeks to capitalize. That, of course, would probably reduce over time the CTR lift that Emoji use could deliver, reducing the value of the technique. And while Emojis themselves are here to stay, if Emoji title stuffing clutters up the SERPs, companies shouldn't be surprised if Google backtracks on its decision to let them into the SERPs in the first place.",Assuming that use of Emojis doesn't hurt a page's SEO and companies experimenting with them see CTRs increasing
1957,"As you wrap up another workday, the last thing you may be inclined to do is sit there and think about what happened. But if you want a more relaxing, stress-free evening, reflecting on the good stuff will go a long way. Findings from a study published in the Academy of Management Journal suggest that taking just a few minutes to reflect positively on the events of the day led to decreased stress -- and a healthier, more relaxed evening. Melissa Korn notes in the Wall Street Journal: It's no surprise that positive thinking can ease tension. But it might prove more practical than employers' current approaches for fighting workplace stress, such as offering flexible work arrangements or creating a new org chart that doesn't actually change daily life at the office, says Theresa Glomb, a work and organizations professor at University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and co-author of the report. The experts at meQuilibrium teach that attempting to minimize or shrink stress isn't enough. You get stronger by flexing your attention muscle -- and controlling where it goes. And while the idea isn't to repress or ignore the bad stuff, it's well worth taking the time to acknowledge the good. Here's three ways to put this into practice before you head home. 1. Don't let one bad event rule the day. Every day has them: an awkward or uncomfortable moment with a coworker, a dressing down by the boss, a slip-up. It happens. But if you let that one moment define the day, you're doing what we call ""magnifying"" -- or exaggerating aspects of a situation and underestimating others. Recognize the discomfort -- and identify what good may come out of it. For every one less-than-stellar moment, think of two other good things that happened. And they don't have to be career changing. Having a great lunch with a friend counts. 2. Ask yourself why. Glomb told Korn that while listing good things is key, ""the real impact comes from writing down why those things led to good feelings. That act highlights the resources and support a person has in their work life -- such as skills, a good sense of humor, an encouraging family or a compassionate boss."" If you felt positive about a meeting you had with a colleague, why? Was it because the exchange felt energized and promising, or was just a lot less painful than you expected? Maybe you felt productive, appreciated. Identify the why and you extend the benefits of the reflection. 3. Make it a habit. Okay, you did it! Now the key is to do this tomorrow. And the next day. Decide what you can do to make this ritual simple, quick, and meaningful. What tools appeal to you? Perhaps you love jotting things down in your Moleskine notebook (I do love the feel of a roller pen across those smooth pages). If you're digitally inclined, there are loads of productivity apps out there. But one I have personally used for years is iDoneThis -- it's the inverse of a to-do list. Your to-DONE list is where you put in what you got done today. The web interface is refreshingly simple and plain. It shoots you an email at whatever time of day you like, and asks you to take five minutes to jot down what you got done. Reply to the email and it populates the cloud-based calendar on your computer or handheld app. Or you can input in the app directly. (You can also use this tool to track team accomplishments.) Don't forget to add the ""why"" or a line or two about why this matters, to get the full benefit of the day's reflection. Building balanced awareness of your day also matters. And that's why another thing worth doing is noting where your emotions and mood take you off the rails (which undoubtedly results in the less-than-stellar moments). Check out meQ's own app, which is designed to let you track your moods and emotions throughout the day. When you're aware of where things go awry, you'll be more capable of addressing them -- and feeling better about it. Want to dramatically reduce your stress? Take our 28-day challenge.

1961,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Pushed left by backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic leaders adopted a draft platform over the weekend that commits the party to a more aggressive stance on climate change—more aggressive, in some areas, than the positions of the party's presumptive nominee. Appointees of Sanders and Hillary Clinton met in Orlando this weekend to hammer out the party's policy goals in advance of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month, where the platform will be formally adopted by delegates. ""Democrats believe that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities."" The negotiating sessions went past midnight and were described by committee members as the most contentious in decades, due to Sanders' stronger-than-expected showing in the primaries, which resulted in the party giving him unusual influence over the platform. The draft language agreed to Sunday morning includes an endorsement to support ""every tool available to reduce emissions now,"" which most significantly includes an endorsement for pricing carbon. ""Democrats believe that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases should be priced to reflect their negative externalities, and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and help meet our climate goals,"" the draft reads. A carbon tax was part of Sanders' big push on climate policy during the primary race, while Clinton has resisted calling for anything that can be misconstrued as a tax hike in an election year. Putting a price on carbon isn't controversial policy if you're talking to an economist. But Clinton has justified keeping its distance by saying climate change ""is too important to wait for climate deniers in Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation,"" i.e., a carbon tax. Clinton will be sticking to that reasoning regardless of what the party platform says. ""Her plan is clearly articulated on her website,"" Clinton Energy Policy Adviser Trevor Houser said this weekend, according to the Associated Press. ""It's not her plan."" The campaign did not return a request for comment. That indicates the limited reach of the party platform. Although it's designed to articulate the positions of the party as a whole, individual politicians—even the party's standard-bearer—aren't bound to it. But Sanders has indicated that one of his main goals is to push the party as a whole toward more dramatic action on issues like climate change, and the platform provides the best articulation yet of that direction. The draft platform hammered out over the weekend includes a few other small nods to Sanders' climate positions. It marks the official death among Democrats of the once-popular talking point that natural gas can be ""a bridge fuel"" to renewables. The platform now pits clean energy against gas, by incentivizing wind, solar, and renewables over new natural gas-fired power plants. The draft also reflects a change in the left's thinking reflected in President Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline last year, stating that Democrats should ""ensure federal actions don't 'significantly exacerbate' global warming"" before supporting new infrastructure projects. Progressive Democrats hardly got everything they wanted, particularly on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Obama strongly supports over the objections of many environmentalists, and a nationwide ban on fracking. The platform committee settled on Clinton's proposal to regulate fracking's methane emissions and impact on water quality, instead of calling for the Sanders-preferred nationwide ban. Despite some mixed outcomes, Sanders feels he has won enough in the party's platform to finally take himself out of the running for the Oval Office. He's expected to endorse Clinton on Tuesday.",push the party as a whole toward more dramatic action on issues like climate change
1963,"I couldn't wait to put the trick to the test, and to my complete disbelief, I woke up the next morning unable to even remember getting to the eighth second of the exhale because it knocked me out that fast. For the next four nights leading up to the big day, even as my stress increased, I was able to fall asleep the minute I tried the 4-7-8 trick. I also used it to relax in the moments leading up to the speech. When you feel stressed or anxious, adrenaline courses through your veins, your heart beats at a rapid rate, and your breathing becomes quick and shallow. So before I get into the specifics behind how the trick works, I wanted to explain in my own words what it feels like when you try it. To me, the effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eight—when your breath is so shallow and short—your body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park. When you first start, you'll be desperate to just take in another breath, or you'll want to speed up your counting, but if you stick to the numbers (or at least try to) and don't take any breaks (in other words, consecutively repeat the 4-7-8 without resuming regular breathing), you can literally feel your heart rate slow down, your mind get quieter, and your whole body physically relax. It washes over you like a calming, relaxing drug. I can never remember getting past the first set of 4-7-8. Do you know the feeling of being put under by anesthesia, where you are conscious, and the next thing you remember is waking up? That's what this is like for me: As soon as I start the practice, the next thing I know, I'm waking up in the morning and can't even remember beginning the 4-7-8 count the night before. Crazy. Now to the more technical details: People who are stressed or anxious are actually chronically under-breathing, because stressed people breathe shortly and shallowly, and often even unconsciously hold their breath. By extending your inhale to a count of four, you are forcing yourself to take in more oxygen, allowing the oxygen to affect your bloodstream by holding your breath for seven seconds, and then emitting carbon dioxide from your lungs by exhaling steadily for eight seconds. The technique will effectively slow your heart rate and increase oxygen in your bloodstream, and may even make you feel slightly lightheaded, which contributes to the mild sedative-like effect. It will instantly relax your heart, mind, and overall central nervous system because you are controlling the breath versus continuing to breathe short, shallow gasps of air.","By extending your inhale to a count of four, you are forcing yourself to take in more oxygen, allowing the oxygen to affect your bloodstream by holding your breath for seven seconds, and then emitting carbon dioxide from your lungs by exhaling steadily for eight seconds."
1970,"You should be peeing in your shower – not just for the liberating, rebellious adrenaline rush that you may or may not get from it, but because you could save the planet, just a little bit, by doing so. Let’s think about it for a moment, mathematically. Every single time you pee, you have to flush the toilet. Whereas those foul smelly poops do need considerable amounts of water to send them off to the mysterious aquatic underworld below, urine barely needs any encouragement once the flushing begins. Although many toilet flushes can be stopped part of the way through their noisy waterfalls, most can’t, and that’s wasting a heck of a lot of water. An average flush for a modern, Western-style toilet uses 6 liters (1.6 gallons) of water, and the average adult pees about seven times every 24 hours. That means that each day of weeing takes 42 liters (11.1 gallons) of toilet water to flush away. Assuming that people urinate the same way every single day, this means in just one year, the average person uses 15,330 liters (4,050 gallons) of toilet water. There are 319 million people in the US, so assuming they all pee the same – which they don’t, but we’re making broadly accurate assumptions here – that’s about 4.9 trillion liters (1.3 trillion gallons) of water flushed away in the name of urine every 365 days. For comparison, that’s like flushing away 1.97 million Olympic-sized swimming pools’ worth per annum. Now, if you peed in the shower, you’d massively reduce this figure. Say that this means that you only pee in a toilet six, not seven times, per day. This means that in just one year, you’d save 2,190 liters (579 gallons) of toilet water. Extrapolating this to the entire US population, that’s 699 billion liters (185 billion gallons) of water saved. Partly thanks to man-made climate change, and partly thanks to inefficient use of water resources, water supplies around the world are running incredibly low. So go on, do the planet a favor – pee as you shower.","in just one year, you’d save 2,190 liters (579 gallons) of toilet water"

Adidas, who has manufactured the Colombian team’s jerseys Adidas, who has manufactured the Colombian team’s jerseys since 2011 , is far from the first organization to make the spelling error. In fact, the misspelling is so common it inspired a group of Colombians to start the social media campaign #ItsColombiaNotColumbia in 2013. Back then, Carlos Pardo, one of the men behind the campaign, explained to The Huffington Post why it’s so important that people spell his country’s name correctly. ""More than it being a bother, it’s the fact that a name is a very important part of someone’s identity,"" Pardo told HuffPost. ""If my name is Carlos and they call me something different repeatedly, I’m going to feel bad. We just want people to call us by our name, but the issue goes beyond the name, we want people to be interested in the positive things that are happening here.""

1989,"African American women and white women may not be affected by the same subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a new study suggests, which is troubling considering currently available HPV vaccines do not protect against the subtypes that were most commonly found in African American women. Researchers from the Duke University School of Medicine examined the HPV subtypes present in 572 people who were part of the Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cohort Study, all of whom had abnormal Pap tests. Of those women, 280 were African American and 292 were white. They looked particularly at HPV subtypes present in the women's cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), which are abnormalities in the cervix that are considered precursors to cervical cancer. They wanted to see what differences there may be in early CIN (called CIN1) and more advanced CIN (called CIN2 and CIN3). Among the women with early CIN, HPV subtypes 16, 18, 31, 56 39 and 66 were the most frequently detected among white women. For African American women, though, the HPV subtypes 33, 35, 58 and 68 were most frequently detected. And among the women with advanced CIN, subtypes 16, 18, 33, 39 and 59 were the most common among white women. For African American women, subtypes 31, 35, 45, 56, 58, 66 and 8 were most frequently detected. Right now, the currently available HPV vaccine targets HPV subtypes 16 and 18, which are the subtypes that most commonly cause cervical cancer. But ""we found a much lower prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 in advanced CIN [CIN2 and 3] from African-American women. Rather, their CIN2 and 3 frequently harbored HPV 31, 35, 45, 56, 58, 66, and 68, all of which are linked to cervical cancer,"" study researcher Cathrine Hoyo, Ph.D., M.P.H., associate professor in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at Duke, said in a statement.

1991,"We’re all seen dogs that look like their owners, but our kinship with man’s best friend just got a little deeper. It turns out that dogs can mirror their owners’ personality, according to research published in journal PLOS ONE. More specifically, they pick up on their owner’s anxiety and negativity. Researchers from Austria tested and observed 132 owners and their dogs. They asked the owners about their own, and their dog’s, personalities, and the owner about their social attitudes to their dog and towards other humans. They filmed the dogs and their owners to observe their behaviour in one play session, and two threatening situations. They also measured their heart rate, and tested their stress hormone cortisol through their saliva. They found that owners and dogs influence each other’s stress levels and coping mechanisms, with owners being more influential than their dogs. So the more anxious and neurotic a person, the more likely it is that their dog will be the same. The study states: Dogs are sensitive to their owners ́ emotional states, and emotional contagion between owners and dogs is possible. Thus, dogs may mirror the anxiety and negative expectations of neuroticistic owners.","Dogs are sensitive to their owners ́ emotional states, and emotional contagion between owners and dogs is possible"

1997,"By Andrea Thompson, Planet Earth Editor: As expected, what was Tropical Storm Humberto became the first hurricane of the 2013 season early this morning (Sept. 11), narrowly missing out on becoming the latest-forming first hurricane in the modern record. Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 5 a.m. EDT today, and is currently sporting maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), just above the 74-mph threshold between tropical storms and hurricanes. The hurricane could strengthen more today before weakening on Thursday, according to the latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Humberto's transition into a hurricane occurred on the same day as Hurricane Gustav in 2002, but happened three hours earlier, according to University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy, which meant Humberto just missed out on snagging the record for latest hurricane to form in a season in the era of aircraft reconnaissance and satellites (since about 1944). [Image Gallery: Hurricane Season 2013] After Gustav and Humberto, the next latest hurricanes to form were Diana, on Sept. 10, 1984, and Erin, on Sept. 9, 2001, McNoldy wrote on his blog. Sept. 10 is the climatological ""peak"" of the hurricane season, which means that it is, on average, the date with the most activity in the Atlantic basin. The peak occurs at this time of year because it is the point when ocean waters are warmest, after heating up all spring and summer, and warm waters are the fuel of the convection that drives tropical storms and hurricanes. While the first half of the 2013 season before this peak was fairly busy, with eight named storms (a storm becomes named when it reaches tropical storm status), none of those storms managed to reach hurricane status before Humberto. Storms were hampered by a combination of factors, including strong wind shear, a condition where winds change direction with height, and dry air blowing off of Africa. Those conditions are waning now, allowing activity in the basin to ramp up. In addition to Hurricane Humberto, Tropical Storm Gabrielle re-formed earlier this week, just before hitting Bermuda last night. Gabrielle brought storm surge, tropical storm-force winds and rain to the island. Over the next few days, Gabrielle will roughly parallel the East Coast before potentially impacting Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Forecasters are also watching two other areas for development, one to the east of the Lesser Antilles, which the NHC is giving only a 10 percent chance of strengthening, and one in the Gulf of Mexico, which has a 40 percent chance.

2015,"As professional event designers it is very rare that we have the opportunity to celebrate the birth of a 1-year-old child. We recently had the pleasure of creating the perfect first birthday bash and had some helpful tips and ideas to help you plan a spectacular day for this very special occasion. Photo credit: Peter Bohler - Pick a theme that the birthday honoree loves. For example, for this particular party, the birthday girl loves owls so we decided to use owls as the inspiration for her birthday celebration. or - Pick colors that the birthday honoree loves. For example not only did she love owls, she loves purple and lavendar. Photo credit: Peter Bohler - Timing: Pick a good time for the honoree so they will be alert and happy. The last thing anyone wants is for their baby to be cranky and tired during their soiree. - Location: Pick a location that the honoree is comfortable with. This party was held in the parent's backyard. We did a combination of round tables, long tables and lounge seating to create an interesting layout transforming the yard into a new environment but still staying in the comfort zone for the birthday girl. Photo credit; Peter Bohler - Decor: We played off the owl theme and used rustic tables with moss centerpieces and wove the owls in different sizes into the centerpieces themselves and then used ribbons in different shades of purple, white and green to hang around the party. We also incorporated flowers on the tables and coordinated the chairs and table linens to have a similar color scheme. We also used mini nests and eggs to be decorative touches for both the dining tables and serving tables tying together the owl theme. Photo credit; Peter Bohler - Entertainment: Entertainment is important to keep kids of various ages engaged throughout the party to avoid whining and complaining. Try hiring a kids DJ, an amazing face painter or have a homemade photo-booth which can incorporate the theme such as an owl backdrop and a multitude of props for the kids. The photos from the photo-booth can have a duel purpose and can be placed in a book for the honoree as a keepsake. You can also hire a strolling magician or an entertaining balloon person who could make just about anything. While the kids are being entertained, adults get the chance to converse with each other, eat and drink. Photo credit; Peter Bohler - Menu: Pick a menu that is filling but doesn't feel like a huge meal (i.e. salad, sushi, mini bites, fruit salad, chips, etc so that it is easy), Bring in easy food for the kids (although at 1, most do not each much), and of course BIRTHDAY cake. Photo credit; Peter Bohler - Birthday Cake/Treats: It is great to have the birthday cake be color coordinated with the party. If you want another sweet idea, you can have a custom candy station in which all candy is in the same color palate as the party. For this particular event, the candy bar had owl shaped cookies and cookies shaped as number 1s to commemorate this First Birthday! Photo credit; Peter Bohler Photo credit; Peter Bohler Overall, have fun with the event. Make sure to make it kid friendly but still a unique experience for the parents. Hope these tips help give your little one the first birthday party of their (and your) dreams.",How to Throw the Perfect 1st Birthday Bash
2020,"She Walks Alone Into The Wolf Enclosure... What Could Possibly Go Wrong? Wolves aren't exactly the house pets that we've always dreamed of. They're thought to be vicious, dangerous, and perhaps better off in the wild. While that may be true for some of them, it is possible to train them as pets -- especially if their lineage isn't 100% wolf. In fact, many dog breeds are directly related to the wolf, making certain wolf-dogs totally awesome companions. But just because it's possible doesn't mean that everyone should attempt to keep them. Take, for example, Spruce and Cochise. Spruce and Cochise had owners who couldn't provide a structured environment for them to thrive in, so they made their way to this wolf sanctuary for a chance at a better life. Spruce is the one with blue eyes and is actually a no content wolf-dog, meaning that she has very little wolf heritage. The grey wolf is Cochise, and he has a bit more wolf heritage than his buddy -- but not so much that he's not a total sweetheart when it comes to humans. As you can see, though, both of these wolf-dogs are incredibly sweet, and just needed the right environment -- one that gives them plenty of space to run and play -- to be happy. Their reaction when their new caretaker comes to see them is downright adorable.",both of these wolf-dogs are incredibly sweet
2023,"Peta Bee discovers how to take strain out of screen time Endless hours put into working and commuting mean the average Londoner spends many a waking hour hovering over a mobile phone or tablet. The result, warn experts, is an epidemic of the rounded shoulders and chronic pain that epitomise ""text neck"", the generational body ailment said to be induced by our addiction to technology. Last month, an Australian chiropractor revealed an alarming increase in the number of teenagers developing abnormally curved spines due to the hours they spend daily with necks bent over their smartphones. It follows several studies that have warned of the damage that can be caused by spending too long in a hunched position, with your head hanging forward. One New York-based expert went so far as to suggest that the undue pressure placed on our necks and upper backs by bad habits is so excessive that it causes wear and tear that could eventually necessitate surgery. In his study, published in the journal Surgical Technology International last year, Dr Kenneth Hansraj, head of spine surgery at New York Spine Surgery & Rehabilitation Medicine, said texting, typing and playing endless hours of Candy Crush Saga puts as much as 27kg worth of pressure on the cervical spine — or the equivalent of more than four stone in weight or the weight of an average seven-year-old child. It’s enough to make you sit poker-straight. Or at least think about how you can lessen the risks that come with using electronic devices. What can be done? Here are some of the best ways to prevent the dreaded hunchback: Get appy Your phone itself can give you the message to straighten up if you download the Text Neck Indicator, an app created by the Text Neck Institute in Florida (text-neck.com). Dr Dean Fishman, the chiropractor who founded the institute, designed the mobile app to remind users when they are, or are not, using good posture. If your phone is held at an unacceptable angle, a red indicator light appears in the top corner and the device beeps to warn you that your neck is under strain. It’s currently available for Android phones, but not yet on iPhones. Hang around Inversion tables and gravitational boots in which you can hang upside down are making a comeback among a generation plagued by back and neck pain. Sammy Margo, a spokesman for The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, describes inversion therapy as ""like a subtle form of traction for the back"" but stresses that it needs to be done properly. ""Our discs become compressed in everyday life and hanging therapy is a way of completely stretching the back out again,"" Margo says. Lying on a table or flat surface and allowing your body to hang down can help, as can hanging by your fingertips from a sturdy door frame. Or try a Teeter inversion table (from £395 johnlewis.com or backinaction.co.uk). Head back Garry Trainer, the Primrose Hill-based osteopath who counts Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Emma Thompson among his clients, says that, since many of us are tied to computers, mobile phones and tablets through our work, the key is to minimise tension in the neck area as much as we can. ""Being stuck in the same position for a long time isn’t good for your posture. You need to adopt more or less the opposite position every now and then to offset the risks,"" he says.  ""If you’re always looking down that means you need to tilt the head backwards, supporting it with lightly clasped hands, to reverse the effects every so often."" Self-monitor If you don’t have the luxury of an off-the-scale expensive ergonomic chair, the PostureMinder software (£24.98 backinaction.co.uk) is a cheap option to keep tabs on any desk-based slumping. Using any webcam, the system continually checks your posture as you work, monitoring keyboard and mouse usage as well as prompting you when you need to take a screen break. Couple it with a Lumo Lift (£80 lumobodytech.com), a small sensor designed to be worn just below the collarbone that will buzz a reminder every time you slump your shoulders or next, and you are sorted. Work lying down If standing desks are not your thing, the latest innovation is a desk that allows you to lie down with your monitor positioned above you. Designed in California, the Altwork desk has a control panel that allows you to switch the position of your chair from sitting to lying or standing and to work in a posturally-perfect way.  Its manufacturers say your ""computer seamlessly moves with you, instead of forcing you to conform to it"", although the technology doesn’t come cheap. It goes on sale next year for £3,850 — but advanced orders costing £2,540 can be placed now at altwork.com.",alarming increase in the number of teenagers developing abnormally curved spines due to the hours they spend daily with necks bent over their smartphones
2025,"Ah, Valentine's. Shower your spouse with chocolate. Woo your love with charm. Cheat on one with the other. It's not surprising the days around Valentine's would keep private investigators busy. When both spouse and lover want attention and affection, what's a busy Casanova to do? It's easy to slip up. But that's not why investigators are busy. Lately, the ones who hire them aren't spouses who fear they're being cheated on -- but those who're doing the cheating. Not the cheated on ... Tom Ham is a private investigator out of Tennessee and he'll tell you his work has changed. ""Ten, 15, 20 years ago, infidelity cases were a much bigger part of investigations,"" he says. But he's seen that go down in the last five years. ""Especially around the big 5 holidays, including Valentine's Day, we are getting about a tenth of the calls [from suspicious partners]."" Why? Because spurned lovers no longer need a professional's help to snoop. There are plenty of DIY tools available. If you have access to your partner's smartphone, you likely have access to their calls, texts, emails, pictures, online banking, and even their location (thank you, Find My Friends). Download apps like CallerSmart Reverse Lookup, mCouple, and Couple Tracker -- and suddenly, a mysterious number has a name, the strange text messages have a face, and the quiet disappearances have an exact place. ... but the cheaters Which brings us to the cheaters - and the business they bring to PIs. Jimme Mesis, a private investigator in New Jersey, is the founder of the United States Association of Private Investigators and the editor-in-chief of PI Magazine. What keeps him busy these days is bug sweeping - looking for electronic eavesdropping equipment. They're cheap, effective ... and inconspicuous. ""The general public is doing a lot more of their own investigations,"" Mesis says. That's why Mesis and others like him are getting more and more calls from men (and, yes, women too) believing their suspicious partners may have planted bugs in their homes, offices, and cars to catch them in their affairs. ""I'm almost 90% bug sweeping,"" Mesis says. ""It's increased over the last three years or so."" Depending on the laws in your state, audio and video surveillance could potentially be illegal. But that doesn't stop those suspicious partners to ""buy them for 50 bucks online from Russia or China and have them shipped to their door."" It's such a lucrative market that Mesis has started a company called USABugSweeps.com. Ham Investigations now also offers professional bug sweep. ""It's almost an epidemic,"" said Ham. But it's a profitable one.","Lately, the ones who hire them aren't spouses who fear they're being cheated on -- but those who're doing the cheating"
2026,"A series of Martian craters assumed to have been formed by meteorites may actually be extinct volcanoes so massive that, when they were active billions of years ago, they could have buried Mars in ash. The craters pepper the surface of Arabia Terra, a geologically ancient region of northern Mars. They appear as several huge circular pits that resemble Earth's calderas, in which magma beneath a volcano drains after a volcanic eruption, causing the ground above the magma chamber to collapse. The best example on Mars is a feature called Eden patera, a depression about 85 kilometers long, 55 kilometers wide and 1.8 kilometers deep, says Joseph Michalski, a researcher jointly at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and at the Natural History Museum in London. Using data from several satellites orbiting Mars, Michalski and his colleague Jacob Bleacher, a volcanologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, mapped Eden patera in detail. Eden patera is the best example of suspected supervolcanoes on Mars. Its caldera is shown here as a gray bullseye. In a report in Nature today, they describe three separate calderas within the depression, along with possible signs of a lake of solidified lava and a volcanic vent where lava could have oozed out. ""I just don’t think it’s an impact crater,"" Michalski says. Another possible explanation is that underground ice could have melted and formed the depression, but ice typically isn’t known to form such big features. Rubble raisers Rather, Michalski and Bleacher argue that an entirely new category of volcanoes once existed on Mars: ones that rivalled supervolcanoes on Earth, such as that underlying Yellowstone National Park in the western United States. Researchers suspect that Eden patera and other extinct supervolcanoes may have once spewed out enough ash to cover much of Mars in their rubble. Supervolcanoes are loosely defined as those that erupt at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock, ash and other debris in a single blast. Given their dimensions, Martian supervolcanoes such as Eden could have spewed out enough ash to cover much of Mars in their rubble, Michalski says. No one had recognized these features as supervolcanoes until now because researchers thought that the giant depressions were just eroded impact craters, Michalski says. The idea is likely to stir controversy. ""I wouldn’t say I’m convinced, but it’s certainly a plausible idea worth getting out there,"" says Brian Hynek, a planetary geologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who has studied how volcanic material is spread around Mars. A close-up view of Eden patera's floor shows layers that formed when lava in an ancient lake attached to the floor of the volcanic crater, froze against the bedrock and then broke away as the lake drained. These ancient volcanoes would have been fundamentally different from others on Mars. The planet’s famous Olympus Mons, one of the biggest volcanoes in the Solar System at 625 kilometers across, would have quietly oozed lava for billions of years. By contrast, the ancient Arabian volcanoes would have blasted out ash ferociously, perhaps because their magma was wetter or rose through the planet's crust more quickly, Michalski suggests. Either way, the Arabian volcanoes were probably active only in the first billion years of Martian history, and then ceased to erupt. They are likely to have played a big part in the early evolution of Mars, says Hynek — maybe even helping to create environments that were conducive to life. Researchers suspect that Oxus patera, shown here, is a Martian supervolcano.",A series of Martian craters assumed to have been formed by meteorites may actually be extinct volcanoes

2028,"As a writer covering the weed beat, I hear about lots of quirky ideas and concerns, some of which I've affectionately characterized as ""cannabispiracies."" The latest involves a backlash over words that have long been a part of the weed lexicon—""weed"" being one of them. ""Can you stop using the word 'weed' and replace it with cannabis. Especially within the context of law and medicine. It sounds awful not edgy,"" wrote one commenter in reference to a recent story of mine about the Toronto dispensary raids in which I'd written. ""In February, the MMPR program was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, who said patients should be able to grow their own weed."" Another added, ""It's cannabis people... Let's be grown ups about this shit."" I was informed that saying ""weed"" invokes a negative connotation. Instinctively, it struck me as uptight that a word as banal as ""weed""—akin, in my mind, to describing alcohol as ""booze""—is now considered offensive. But a survey of activists in the cannabis community revealed there is a legitimate debate over the term, as well as words like ""dope,"" ""stoner,"" and ""pothead."" ""I say weed all the time, and people are offended,"" said Lisa Campbell, chairwoman of Women Grow Toronto. ""Apparently words like 'weed' and 'pothead' have stigma associated with them. I like to reclaim them."" Medical cannabis patient advocate Tracy Curley, who goes by the moniker ""Weed Woman Canada,"" said the concern over the term ""weed"" comes from the ""Reefer Madness"" prohibition era, when marijuana was dubbed ""Mexican locoweed."" ""That propaganda is part of our history, a long fought one,"" she said. Still, she personally embraces the term ""stiletto stoner,"" and as for ""pothead,"" she said, ""I don't find 'pothead' to be any more derogatory than drinker... I know which one will get home safely at the end of the night."" Others feel much more strongly about it. ""My issue is your use of 'stoner' as a rather pejorative term, whether derogatory or not, like the words 'faggot' or 'queer,'"" one reader wrote me in an email, while accusing me of ""painting all enjoyers with the abuser paint brush"" and setting back the legalization movement. Vancouver-based advocate Dana Larsen, who recently gave away 2 million pot seeds on a cross-country tour, told VICE the media does often ""denigrate"" cannabis users with these terms. ""We don't see regular beer drinkers being called 'drunkards' or wine drinkers being called 'winos' in media stories, but cannabis users get called 'stoners' and 'potheads' regularly,"" he said, noting he'd prefer to be called a ""cannabis enthusiast."" But he's admitted he gets heat from ""purists"" who object to the word ""marijuana"" over ""cannabis."" He uses both but said the former is more widely recognized. That sentiment was echoed by Cannabis Culture owner Jodie Emery, who recently opened two fully recreational dispensaries in Toronto. She pointed to a recent Toronto Star article, in which marijuana was referred to as ""dope"" as offensive. ""'Dope' is a term straight from the Reefer Madness era, equivalent in ridiculousness to calling cannabis 'the reefer'."" Emery herself has likely offended people with some of the analogies she's used to describe the plight of the cannabis community. In a recent police press conference about the dispensary raids, she responded to a complaint about dispensaries breaking the law by referencing civil rights icon Rosa Parks, who refused to give her seat on a public bus to a white guy. Emery's husband, Marc, was later quoted in an article comparing the dispensary raids to Kristallnacht, the night in 1938 when many Jews were moved to concentration camps. When asked by VICE if those comparisons were not insulting, Emery said, ""I want to make it very clear that I'm not comparing the experience of the two oppressed groups, but I am comparing the strategy used—that of civil disobedience."" She said her husband was likening the Toronto police's ""smash-and-grab"" tactics to the government-sanctioned strategies used during Kristallnacht. On a personal level, she said she's been called a ""pothead in pearls"" and ""weed princess,"" neither of which bother her. A few years ago, when cannabis culture was still very much underground, this debate probably would have been laughable. But as the movement gains momentum, conversations we'd once dismiss as ""stoner talk"" are likely to become a part of the mainstream.",use of 'stoner' as a rather pejorative term
2031,"Whether you're hiring a partner, sizing up a colleague, or just trying to get to know someone, asking a very simple question will tell you more about how innovative the person is than virtually anything else you can ask. Innovation Is Not Just About Talent I have to admit at the outset that when I hire senior-level people whom I expect to be innovative it is never just because of talent, brains, or even skills. Figuring out if they have the competency to do the job is actually pretty easy (see my article "" 6 Interview Questions You Must Ask if You Want to Hire the Best People ""). What is infinitely harder to judge is the degree to which they are truly innovative and committed to their ideas. The challenge, of course, is that many people can make a great first impression--but end up being someone totally different when you have to live with them eight to 12 hours a day. I've seen the strain that the wrong partnership can have. What starts off as a blissful union can turn into a nightmare when the underlying values and ambitions of partners don't align. Bringing on board a senior-level individual in a small business is crucial and will have a deep, long-term impact on your company. And partnerships are so hellish to untangle that companies can be ruined in the process. So you really need to get it right from the outset. But you can only assess compatibility and a commitment to innovation through experience, right? Wrong! You can get immense insight into a person's drive, commitment, innovative ability, and even loyalty by asking one utterly simple question. And here's the key: The actual content of his or her answer is interesting but irrelevant! What counts is how someone answers the question. In fact, this technique is so powerful that I've often used it when talking to people I've just met to get a sense for who they are and how they operate. Yes, I'm not much for small talk. Let's just dive into the deep end! The Commitment to Innovation Lie Detector Test I call this my commitment to innovation lie detector test. It's not foolproof, but it's good enough to give you what you need in order to understand how committed someone is to achieving his or her ambitions rather than just dreaming about them. First, here's the question I lead with (Stick with me after you read it, because there is a plot twist here that's critical if you're going to use this technique effectively): ""What are three things you have not yet accomplished that you would never forgive yourself for not having accomplished during the remainder of your life?"" Before you read on, stop and make a mental list of those three things for yourself. Got them? Now read on. Here's the twist. It's a follow-up question. OK, I know I said one question, but I wanted to set you up in the same way I'd set this up in an interview. I don't want the candidate to know that I'm going to ask a follow-up because it's the answer to the follow-up that I care most about. Frankly, within this context, the three things someone has listed are interesting but meaningless to me. Not because they're unimportant, but because we're all entitled to have whatever dreams of grandeur we want. It's the intentional strategies and tactics to achieve them that I want to hear about--that's what tells me who someone really is, how well he or she deals with uncertainty, how sincere the person is about his or her ambitions, and ultimately how innovative the person is. We can all dream; coming up with new ideas is simple. The world does not lack in dreamers, but some of us actually do something about those dreams. And, by the way, doing something isn't just about making a decision; those are easy too. Anyone can decide, but just because you've decided to start a business, become rich, get married, or have kids doesn't make you an entrepreneur, a millionaire, a good spouse, or a good parent. It's what you do after the decision that counts. So here's the follow-up question: ""Specifically, what have you done in the past 30 days to realize each of those three ambitions?"" What I'm looking for are specifics. If you respond immediately with actual tasks, projects, and measurable, tangible efforts, then I'm impressed. I want to see the numbers! How much are you doing? How often? If you have to think about it, then I'm worried, because, after all, you just told me that these were the three most important things in your life. And you're not doing anything specific to realize them? Really? Anything less than direct quantifiable and tangible effort to achieve these three ambitions tells me that the person I'm talking to lacks adequate discipline and self-direction. Most important, it tells me that this is someone who isn't accustomed to doing the hard work it takes to realize his or her dreams. Instead, the person expects that just deciding on having the dream is sufficient. By the way, there's a name for that. It's called entitlement, and it's the last thing I want from someone on my team, especially a senior-level hire! I want the person to know what it means to earn success rather than expecting it to be handed over! Entitlement is what destroys relationships and partnerships. Entitled people simply expect to be right, are regularly frustrated and blame others for their shortcomings, rarely take ownership of their actions, anger, temper, and reactions to others, have a short fuse and get exasperated easily, and are not transparent--in short they make lousy partners because they're usually too busy arguing about who's right rather than what's right. Innovative people don't care about who's right; they care about what's right. My suggestion is that you start using this technique not only in interview settings but with your interpersonal relationships as well. You'll find that it provides an incredibly powerful way to determine if your ambitions and commitment to a shared vision of the future are aligned with a colleague, friend, or partner or your spouse. Oh, by the way, you did have quantifiable and tangible activities that supported the three items you said would never forgive yourself for not accomplishing, right? Please, tell me you did.","Specifically, what have you done in the past 30 days to realize each of those three ambitions?"

We've all been there before: You spend what seems like hours trying to fall asleep, tossing and turning and growing increasingly frustrated. You look at the clock and realize it's three in the morning, meaning you only have a few more hours to sleep before it's time to get up to go to work. No matter what you do, you just can't seem to get yourself to the point of relaxation you need. It might be the worst feeling in the world. If that sounds familiar to you, don't fret: We've got some interesting ways to get yourself relaxed and ready for sleep, so you never have to go through that scenario again. From tongue techniques to deep stretching to intense deep breathing exercises, this is how you prepare your body and mind for a full night of uninterrupted, gloriously refreshing sleep. Try them tonight -- and don't forget to thank us tomorrow. In the beginning, it's important to get your mind into a slower place. Focus your mind and body on taking slow, deep breaths. This will help reduce your heart rate and blood pressure. When you deep breathe, what's really going on? Deep breathing also allows the parasympathetic system (which is responsible for your ability to relax) to override your sympathetic system (which controls your automatic stress response). Then you could always try the 4-7-8 technique. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, you should sit up in bed with your back straight, and press the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth right behind your front teeth. Maintaining that position, close your mouth and inhale through your nose for four counts, hold that breath for seven counts, and then exhale through your mouth around your tongue for eight counts. Repeat this pattern until you have completed four full breaths. Engaging your tongue in the process is actually pretty important. Read this set of instructions carefully and try it for yourself.","According to Dr. Andrew Weil, you should sit up in bed with your back straight, and press the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth right behind your front teeth."
2036,"HBO This season of Game of Thrones has been already been an emotional roller coaster. And if you’re not caught up on the ride (aka the season) be aware that this article will have some Season 6 spoilers. Here’s Melisandre with a Bravos-style greeting as you happily go about your day. HBO/Giphy At this point in the series, fans of both the show and the books know there’s one major character who hasn’t yet been introduced at all. Well, to be fair, there are lots of major characters who haven’t (and won’t) be introduced, this one is different. Her name is Lady Stoneheart and we already have met her. Sort of. Lady Stoneheart is the resurrected corpse of everybody’s favorite Tully turned loving Stark, Catelyn. In the books, the brotherhood without banners takes the Lady’s corpse (Thank you, Red Wedding) and brings it back to life (and we know from Arya’s time with them that they totally have the capability to do it). Many fans of the books were surprised that the character hasn’t yet shown up in the series since she has a major hand in the fates of other characters. There was some speculation that the show may just skip over the character altogether and find other ways of getting to the same fates. People also thought that maybe the showrunners didn’t want to show a major character’s resurrection because it would take away from the (year-long) speculation about Jon Snow’s death. But now that Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are both headed to Riverrun (where Lady Stoneheart, aka Catelyn Stark, happens to be from) to deal with her brother the Blackfish, all the dominos are finally in place for the character’s big reveal. And, from what we know of Lady Stoneheart, she will definitely make an entrance (you know, if the show decides to bring her in). HBO/Giphy This season has already been filled with tons of stories of resurrection, both literal and metaphorical. From Jon Snow’s most obvious return to the resurrection of Arya Stark (with her reclaiming Needle and seemingly giving up her quest to give up her identity and serve the Faceless God) to Daenerys’ return to her rightful place as Khaleesi, it would definitely fit with the season’s overall theme. And it’s likely no coincidence that another Stark we thought was dead just happened to pop up, resurrected and transformed, in the last episode. Hopefully we can see this badass character make a memorable appearance. And, while they’re at it, maybe we can bring back Robb Stark just, you know, because?

2038,"If cities were to turn off all their lights — all their street lamps, billboards, neon signs, car headlights — a clear night sky would look something like this: That shimmering river of stars is, of course, the Milky Way. Most of us living in urban areas can’t see it because of all the light pollution. In big cities, we’re lucky to even glimpse the Big Dipper. It’s becoming harder and harder to pick out our place in the universe. How hard is it? In a new study for Science Advances, an international team of researchers created the most detailed atlas yet of light pollution around the world. They estimate that the Milky Way is no longer visible to fully one-third of humanity — including 60 percent of Europeans and 80 percent of Americans. Artificial light from cities has created a permanent ""skyglow"" at night, obscuring our view of the stars. Here’s their map of artificial sky brightness in North America, represented as a ratio of ""natural"" nighttime sky brightness. In the black areas, the natural night sky is still (mostly) visible. In the blue and green areas, stars start fading from the horizon and zenith. In the yellow areas, the natural sky is lost, drowned out by street lamps and lit-up buildings. In the red and white areas, it’s usually impossible to see the Milky Way with the naked eye — in many places, there are often fewer than 100 stars visible. Here’s their map of Europe. Note that there are very few dark-sky regions anywhere on the continent: And here’s the entire world: The research team, led by Fabio Falchi of the Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in Italy, used low-light imaging data from NOAA/NASA's Suomi polar-orbiting satellite to create the map, calibrating the data with thousands of ground readings. ""I hope that this atlas will finally open the eyes of people to light pollution,"" Falchi said in a statement. It’s not just cities — dark-sky refuges are becoming rarer and rarer Dan Duriscoe of the National Park Service, a co-author of the paper, told me he wasn’t surprised by the level of light pollution in cities themselves. We’ve known that for a long time. ""What’s surprising,"" he said, ""is how far the glow from these lights reaches out into outskirts and unpopulated areas."" That matters, because for those who do want to see the stars in all their glory (or for astronomers trying to use telescopes), it’s harder to find skies unblemished by artificial light. ""If you lived in Switzerland, you’d have to travel more than 1,000 kilometers,"" Duriscoe says. The United States still has a few dark-sky areas — particularly around southeastern Oregon, western Utah, and northern Arizona. But even those are being encroached upon by light from nearby cities like Las Vegas. ""Most people are happy not to live in wilderness so long as there’s someplace they can go,"" Duriscoe says. ""But the problem is that with the expansion of light pollution, these places are becoming more and more remote."" That said, there is an optimistic side to this story. As scientists have piled up evidence of the dangers of too much light pollution — from energy waste to sleep disruption — more cities are finding ways to cut down the glare. And many US parks are taking new measures to preserve what remaining dark skies we have. (More on this below.) ""We're definitely seeing a growing interest in night sky protection,"" Scott Kardel, the public affairs director for the International Dark-Sky Association, a nonprofit that works to reduce light pollution, told me last year. While it's implausible that cities will ever go totally dark, there are ways to reduce the harm from light pollution — and preserve what dark spots we have remaining. Does it really matter if we can't see the stars? At first blush, it's hard to imagine why light pollution is a problem. Sure, it's nice to gaze at the constellations. But artificial lighting is also incredibly valuable. We no longer have to squint to read by candlelight or hold up a lantern to walk down streets at night. Put another way: No one looks at that famous satellite image of North Korea enshrouded in darkness at night and thinks they're better off than brightly lit South Korea next door. But we’ve also arguably gone overboard with modern-day urban lighting. As Christopher Kyba of Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum in Germany, another co-author of the Science Advances paper, explained to me, scientists have found that excessive artificial lighting at night can have a number of adverse consequences: 1) Light pollution can disrupt our sleep. Some research suggests that exposure to certain wavelengths of light at night can suppress our bodies' ability to produce melatonin — and disrupt our slumber. This is why it's harder to fall asleep right after staring at your computer screen all evening (blue light is particularly disruptive). But light pollution in cities coming through bedroom windows may also play a role here. 2) It messes with wildlife. In the last decade, scientists have begun to realize that artificial lighting at night affects animals and ecosystems in all sorts of unexpected ways. Sea turtles get confused by the lighting from coastal cities and lose their ability to navigate in the ocean. Migrating birds often get bewildered by tall buildings that are lit up and smash right into them. Some scientists even suspect that artificial lighting at night makes it harder for fireflies to find each other and mate. These ecological impacts can trickle over to humans, too. There's some evidence that artificial lighting can, for example, make it harder for zooplankton to eat away at harmful algae in lakes, which lowers drinking water quality. (Kyba is currently involved in a follow-up study in Germany on this topic.) 3) It's a big waste of energy. Lighting at night is useful. But do we need so much of it? Many street lamps are built so that they shine light in every direction (including up at the sky) rather than focusing purely on the ground. And many streetlights shine even in the wee hours when no one actually needs them. By some estimates, 40 percent of a city's electric bill goes toward street lighting — and about half of that is simply wasted. That would imply the US squanders about $3.5 billion on excessive lighting each year. 4) It can diminish our sense of the universe. Okay, this one's more abstract. But many astronomers really do think it's a tragedy that we're cut off from the stars. ""Increasingly, urban youth only see constellations on computer screens or in planetariums,"" one scientist lamented at a 2012 AAAS conference on the subject. ""The lack of the night sky may therefore affect their sense of the scale of the universe and their place in it."" To Duriscoe, the loss of the night sky is a profound one. ""I don’t think it’s a coincidence that astronomy is the oldest science,"" he says. ""It’s because people have been looking at these lights in the sky and these comets and planets and wondering what’s going on up there. It’s really stimulating. When you see it for yourself, when you see the real universe for yourself, there’s nothing like that firsthand experience."" More cities are trying to cut back on artificial lighting Now here’s the good news: As light pollution becomes a bigger issue, some countries are starting to cut back on excessive lighting. France, for instance, recently passed a national law cracking down on light pollution,with steps like restricting the hours of storefront lighting. In the United States, the best-known example is Los Angeles, which is replacing its old bulbous street lamps that scattered light in every direction with newer, more efficient LEDs that only send light downward. As Ucilia Wang illustrated in Forbes, the reduction in glare has been dramatic, and the skies overhead are now noticeably darker. (That said, cities interested in reducing light pollution need to be careful about color selection. Many LEDs largely emit blue light, which actually brightens the night sky more than any other color.) There are other lighting technologies cities could adopt, too. ""We now have the ability to dim lights in ways that we couldn't before,"" Kardel told me. ""And we can even equip streetlights with sensors so that they only turn on when traffic or people are nearby."" Kardel noted that more and more cities are taking a closer look at these technologies. The catch is that this is usually done to save money, and not necessarily to bring back the night sky. And that can have unexpected consequences: Kyba, for his part, warns of the ""rebound effect"": if businesses or municipal governments save money by installing more-efficient lighting, they may end up ploughing the savings into lighting more structures overall. There's also a big push to preserve ""dark-sky places"" Obviously a city like Los Angeles is always going to be too big and bright for people to be able to see all of the stars or the Milky Way. For that, people will still have to travel out to rural areas. But there's also increasing interest in protecting these ""dark-sky"" regions for astronomers, nocturnal wildlife researchers, and the growing number of tourists who want to see what the night sky actually looks like. A number of parks and communities — both in the United States and elsewhere — have applied to be ""international dark-sky places."" For communities that apply — like Sedona, Arizona — this typically means following stringent lighting codes at night (like shielding lights under a canopy, dimming them when possible, and even turning them off after a certain hour.) The National Park Service, too, is now working with communities around the Colorado Plateau to try to preserve the nighttime sky in this region — which is both a popular tourist destination and an important area to astronomers. As Megan Finnerty reported in the Arizona Republic in 2014, however, this isn't always easy to do. In theory, northern Arizona has plenty of reason to protect its dark skies, since its astronomy and tourism programs bring in millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. But the responses from different cities has been mixed. On the one hand, Tucson implemented lighting codes 30 years ago and hasn't gotten any brighter at night since, despite growing rapidly. On the other hand, light from Phoenix remains a problem, since it can travel 200 miles in every direction. And the city has been slow to update its lighting codes — or enforcing the ones on the books. Kardel, for his part, notes that most of the biggest dark-sky preservation efforts are still taking place within the Colorado Plateau — campaigners haven't yet focused on how to deal with light from surrounding metropolises like Phoenix and Las Vegas. ""This place is already world-recognized for its dark skies, and many places are taking an increased interest in ways to preserve that resource.""

""Skip, they wouldn’t want to ask me that,"" Carter said. ""They wouldn’t want my answer to represent them because God knows I have been nothing but blessed. These 33 years have been nothing but a blessing. I have never — and never is a strong word — never dealt with racism."" While the rapper admitted he wasn’t sure if it’s because racism really isn’t that common or if it’s the result of the ""blessings"" God has bestowed upon him, he said, ""it is my reality."" ""So you’ve never experienced any offensive behavior from any other color?"" Bayless asked again. ""Never,"" Carter repeated. Later in the interview, Carter also acknowledged the fact that there are a lot of white people who show up to his concerts — a fact he said goes to show ""there is no such thing as racism"" anymore. The popular performer also weighed in on the recent rash of police officer-related shootings of black men, telling Bayless’ co-host Shannon Sharpe it’s important to ""figure out what’s going on first,"" adding that the solution might be as simple as ""coming together"" as a country.

2044,"Why are some voices more attractive than others? It's complicated. Previous studies showed that men tend to prefer women with high-pitched voices, which are associated with high levels of estrogen. And women? They tend to prefer men with deep voices, which are linked with more testosterone. But new research suggests that we're also attracted to voices that are similar to our own -- because the similarity makes us feel that we're part of a certain social group. ""The voice is an amazingly flexible tool that we use to construct our identity,"" Dr. Molly Babel, a linguistics professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada and the lead author of the new study, said in a written statement. ""Very few things in our voices are immutable, so we felt that our preferences had to be about more than a person’s shape and size."" For the new study, Babel and her colleagues asked college-aged men and women in California to rate the attractiveness of 60 different voices (30 male, 30 female) belonging to people living west of the Mississippi River. The researchers found that many men and women preferred voices of people from their own regional area or community. ""The speakers we used were mostly from California, but some were from neighboring states,"" Babel told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Three of the voices came from as far away as Minnesota. The voices were variable because they covered this geographical and therefore dialectal range, but they were not immensely variable. There weren't any easy to (at least generically) identify southern U.S. accents or New York/New Jersey accents. The words that we used in our study also helped narrow down the variability, and were useful in illustrating the dialect range of our voices."" For instance, the study subjects preferred female voices that pronounced the ""oo"" sound — as in the word ""goose"" — further forward in the mouth. That's typically a characteristic of West Coast speech. ""All of the listeners in our study were born and raised in California since at least toddlerhood, and were students at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the time of the study,"" Babel said in the email. ""So, our study is as much about the listener population as it is about the speaker population. What we found is that these Californian listeners had a preference for voices that exhibited typical sounding voices, but what exactly this means is different for the male and female voices.""

2052,"Chaos erupted at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday as supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed over the awarding of the state’s 35 pledged delegates. Clinton edged Sanders in the Nevada caucus on Feb. 20th (52.6 percent to 47.3 percent). On April 2, however, the state party held its Clark County convention and Sanders mobilized more delegates than the Clinton campaign (1,613 to 1,298), which swung the delegate count in his favor. At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion’s share of the remaining 12 delegates. Instead, the delegate allocation rules were abruptly changed and Clinton was awarded 7 of the 12 delegates. State party chair, Roberta Lange, told caucus-goers that the ""ruling by the Chair is not debatable; we cannot be challenged and I move that...and I announce that the rules have been passed by the body."" Predictably, a chorus of boos followed and the convention was forced to end on a frenzied note. What happened in Nevada is likely to happen elsewhere. The perception that the DNC has thrown its institutional support behind Clinton has only deepened the internal divide within the party. The Sanders wing is pissed off, and rightfully so. The establishment support for Clinton was apparent in the superdelegate gap. Superdelegates are a noxious device to begin with, but they’re part of the process and, however objectionable Sanders supporters find them, no rules have been broken on that front. In New York, however, where the process wasn’t so much rigged as designed to make it uncommonly difficult for non-incumbents or Democratic challengers to compete are problematic at best, particularly in this climate. Then there’s the Hillary Victory Fund, which has become a massive fundraising vehicle for the Clinton campaign. The HVF was created by the DNC and Clinton’s super PAC Hillary for America as a means of raising funds both for the Clinton campaign and down-ballot races across the country. Individuals can give over $350,000 to the joint committee if they donate the maximum amount to Clinton, the DNC and the state parties. Federal elections laws, however, do not allow individual donations to specific candidates to exceed $2,700.","At the state convention this weekend, the final step in the process, Sanders supporters hoped to secure the lion’s share of the remaining 12 delegates.

2066,"The hole in the space station is superficial but a little unsettling for Earthbound folk. When you sit around imagining life aboard the International Space Station (we all do that, right?) one thing you probably don’t want to think about is space junk slamming into your vessel. And you almost certainly don’t want to imagine a piece of that junk taking a chunk of your spacecraft’s window with it. Especially not when the chipped window in question is the one that provides some of the best views of Earth. [NASA reminds us that astronaut poop burns up ‘like shooting stars’] But that’s exactly what happened last month in the space station’s Cupola, a European-built 2010 addition that you’re sure to recognize — it’s where those great pictures and videos showing stunning shots of our planet are taken. ""I am often asked if the International Space Station is hit by space debris,"" British astronaut Tim Peake, who took the freaky photo of the damaged window, said in a statement. ""Yes — this is the chip in one of our Cupola windows, glad it is quadruple glazed!"" Um, yeah. You can say that again. NASA released an animation depicting space trash in motion around Earth. (YouTube/NASA) The astronauts, of course, are perfectly safe — they generally don’t tweet photos during life-threatening station crises. And the views are safe, too — the chip is less than a centimeter across. According to the European Space Agency, the damage was likely caused by something as unassuming as a flake of paint or a metal fragment just a few thousandths of a millimeter across. A FLAKE OF PAINT. Let that sink in. Because of the incredibly high speeds of these orbiting pieces of debris, something 1 centimeter across could disable critical instruments on the space station, and anything larger could penetrate the sturdy shields that protect crew modules. Debris 10 centimeters across could shatter the spacecraft into pieces. In 2013, experts estimated that there were at least 29,000 objects of this size orbiting Earth. The danger posed by errant space debris were dramatized in the 2013 film ""Gravity,"" in which astronauts on a shuttle mission are terrorized by speeding chunks of space junk. Space junk is definitely a real concern. Mashable reports that NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of. These days space agencies try to be more mindful of the waste left behind by missions, but no one has found an ideal solution for cleaning up the junk that’s already there.","NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites and old rocket bits orbiting Earth, some no larger than marbles, so that the space station can be maneuvered away from close encounters — but many small pieces, like the one that hit the space station, are too difficult to keep track of"

When it comes to good gym etiquette, our Facebook fans and Twitter followers told us wiping sweat off of shared equipment and machines is basically their Golden Rule. But even though it's gross to lie down into a puddle of someone else's perspiration on the bench press, there's not actually anything inherently germy about sweat. So what's the deal? Turns out, our health-minded community is on to something. Warm, moist environments are where bacteria really like to grow, says Dr. Pritish Tosh, M.D., infectious diseases physician at the Mayo Clinic. And if the gym isn't a warm, moist environment, we don't know what is. ""There is certainly a potential for transmission of certain kinds of infections,"" he says. One biggie is community-acquired MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), Tosh says, an infection ""caused by a strain of staph bacteria that's become resistant to the antiobiotics commonly used to treat ordinary staph infections,"" according to the Mayo Clinic's website. MRSA outbreaks have been documented among athletic teams that share equipment, especially wrestling teams, he says. Porous materials -- like machine padding and yoga mats -- are probably more problematic than something like dumbbells, since bacteria will thrive on those soft, squishy materials when they get damp and warm. ""With things like athletic pads worn by hockey players, you can see people who are unable to get rid of their own skin infections,"" says Tosh. ""They keep getting reinfected, because it lingers in the pads, so it's important to keep those things as clean as possible."" Other germs that may linger on shared equipment could cause urinary tract infections, E. coli, fungus growth (athlete's foot, anyone?) and warts, including those caused by human papillomavirus, Men's Fitness reported. And let's not forget about cold and flu viruses. If you know you're sick with the flu, as a common courtesy to your fellow gym rats, maybe skip a couple of your public sweat sessions, says Tosh. ""It's best to avoid those situations in a public area in close proximity to others so you don't spread your illness."" And if you do feel a cough or sneeze coming on at the gym, do us all a favor and unleash that spray into the crook of your elbow rather than all over the treadmill. Bottom line: Even though your risk is relatively low of actually catching a really nasty bug at the gym, says Tosh, wiping up is more than just polite.",wiping up is more than just polite

To paraphrase the academically dense and pedantic paper, reducing the alcohol content in beer, liquor, and wine presents a solution to harmful drinking habits and patterns. It ensures liquor companies won't lose any profits by selling less alcohol, and the rest of us would still be able to indulge in as many alcoholic drinks as we desire. The logic is sound... in theory. If people are going to keep drinking in excess, let's reduce the amount of alcohol in their drinks. It's the same! Just less.

2072,"6 Shares Share Tweet Share Share Email Cheap, easy to prepare and undeniably delicious, instant noodles have become a favorite food in many countries around the world despite its reputation for being unhealthy. Also called instant ramen, the pre-cooked dried noodles packed with flavoring powder and seasoning oil, has often been criticized as a meal devoid of nutrients. Despite the meal being notoriously known to be high in carbohydrates and fat but very low in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, it has somehow retained its global popularity, According to the World Instant Noodles Association (WINA), 52 countries consumed 97.7 billion servings last year alone. Among its highest consumers are China and Hong Kong, which together consumed 40.43 billion servings, followed by Indonesia, with 13.20 billion servings consumed. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. is not too far behind with 4 billion instant noodles consumed in 2015. But its reputation for being a ""junk food,"" actually gets worse. A Baylor University and Harvard study published in the Journal of Nutrition revealed that eating instant noodles may increase risks of heart disease and stroke, according to Washington Post. The researchers analyzed the health and diet of 11,000 South Koreans between ages 19 and 64. The study showed that South Korean women were at high risk of metabolic syndrome due to the large amounts of ramen they consume. Curiously, the result was not found on male participants, which the scientists attribute to biological differences between the genders.Metabolic syndrome often lead to increased blood sugar and blood pressure levels, causing a higher risk of diabetes, stroke or heart disease. The culprit identified was the substance found in ramen called Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), a petroleum industry byproduct used to preserve cheap processed foods. ""Although instant noodle is a convenient and delicious food, there could be an increased risk for metabolic syndrome given [the food’s] high sodium, unhealthy saturated fat and glycemic loads,"" said Hyun Shin, Harvard School of Public Health doctoral candidate and co-author of the study. Separate studies conducted elsewhere have revealed other potential health hazards. In India, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) found lead contamination in Nestlé’s Maggi brand instant noodles containing 7 times the allowed limit. The agency immediately ordered banning of all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles in India, calling them ""unsafe and hazardous for human consumption."" In South Korea, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) found a cancer-causing substance known as Benzopyrene in six brands of noodles made by Nong Shim back in 2012. The discovery led to a massive recall of the products both local and abroad. (Visited 321,625 times, 60 visits today)",may increase risks of heart disease and stroke

Lansing City Council voted 5-2 to reverse a decision made April 3 in a 6-0 vote that deemed the city a ""sanctuary city"" in writing, the Detroit Free Press reported. A letter the city council received from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging the council to remove all references to ""sanctuary city"" from its resolution is behind the change in course, the Associated Press reported. The term ""sanctuary city"" has sparked much debate as some cities decide to fight President Trump’s decision to crack down on cities that refuse to have their law enforcement agencies cooperate with U.S. immigration authorities. ""The term ‘sanctuary’ in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting — so distracting in my opinion that’s it’s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,"" said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.

2077,"How does a half-million dollar Kickstarter fail? And why would another company step in and spend six figures to raise it from the dead? Chaosium, Inc . is one of the grand old ladies of the role-playing game industry. The company was founded in 1975 by gaming mastermind Greg Stafford, creator of the world of Glorantha and the Pendragon RPG . The company went on publish the seminal horror RPG, Call of Cthulhu which is based on the works of HP Lovecraft. The company, while never a giant in size, punched above its weight and had a devoted fan base. So when Chaosium began a Call of Cthulhu 7th edition Kickstarter in 2013, it did very well, bringing in over $500,000 from thousands of backers. The campaign smashed through stretch goals, which mandated the creation of a further four books. Fans of the game and other non-Euclidean horrors all gibbered in ecstasy, both with the sense that they had contributed in making a beautiful game by backing the Kickstarter, and in anticipation of the sanity-shattering volumes that would soon be in their claws. This was the company’s second six-figure Kickstarter; the previous Horror on the Orient Express campaign having raised $207,804. The expected delivery was October 2013, a deadline which came and went. A new deadline was announced, which was similarly blown through. PDFs of the core books were released in 2014, and many promises were made about printing and shipping. In March of 2015, nearly two years after the end of the campaign, backers were told, ""Following on from our previous update, the printer has the final files and has begun the printing process. We look forward to receiving printer’s proofs in due course."" This too would prove to be a lie. Files had been sent to the printer, but unfortunately, not funds needed to pay for printing. On June 2nd, 2015, Chaosium announced that founder Greg Stafford had returned to the company as president. Fellow genius Sandy Petersen , the original designer of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, returned with him, and the pair made the fulfillment of the company’s Kickstarter orders its number one priority. When Stafford and Petersen returned, Chaosium had less than $10,000 in the bank. Where’d the money go? How does a company that had raised over $750,000 on Kickstarter in two years come to have less ten grand in the bank? In an extensive email interview with Chaosium’s new management, the company’s current president, Rick Meints laid out a tale of mismanagement, poor business strategies, and nigh unethical practices by the company’s prior management. The problems began with the Horror on the Orient Express Kickstarter. The previous management only charged international backers $20 to ship a ten pound game. The actual cost of shipping was vastly higher, sometimes as much as $150 for backers in Japan. Meints said that this Kickstarter alone likely lost Chaosium $170,000. When Greg Stafford took over the company, there were still a number of backers who had yet to receive their products. The Call of Cthulhu Kickstarter compounded these problems. The Kickstarter committed Chaosium to producing eight books, as well as four card decks, and a CD. Then, these products needed to be shipped to backers all over the world. Horror on the Orient Express returned to haunt the company. It was offered as an add-on to Cthulhu backers, who could purchase a copy for a mere $65 (the product is $119.95 on Chaosium’s website) and the company only charged a dollar for shipping. A half-million-dollar Kickstarter seems small when weighed against that stack of product and shipping costs, and it proved as much. The magnitude of the error can be seen in a simple glance at the shipping. At the ""Nictitating Nyarlathotep"" level of pledge, backers would end up having eight books shipped to them. International backers had to pay a total of $355 for all their rewards plus shipping, which sounds like a lot, until you consider that’s only $15 more than customers in the continental US were paying. The idea that shipping eight books to Japan would cost a mere $15 more is a madness not even Lovecraft could have conceived. Meints said that tens of thousands of dollars went to layout, art, writing, and editing the volumes. Furthermore, Chaosium was located in Hayward, California, a suburb of San Francisco. The cost of running a warehouse and office there was also taken out of the Kickstarter funds. Chaosium fell behind in paying artists, editors, and authors. The new management discovered as many as a hundred were owed payment by Chaosium, and some had been waiting for over a decade for their money. When Stafford returned to the company in June of 2015, he found the company was cash poor, with extensive outstanding obligations, and appeared to have no way to meet them. Stafford had birthed Chaosium. Would he also bury it? The Stars Come Right for Chaosium In August, Stafford announced the award-winning team of Moon Design Publications would take over management of Chaosium. The Moon Design team handled the crisis in a bold and time-honored way: they threw money at it. The Moon Design team spent six figures out of their own personal pockets to have Call of Cthulhu 7th edition printed and shipped. Meints estimates that by the time all the backer rewards are shipped, they will have spent more than $100,000 on shipping alone. At long last, the printer was paid, and the books were printed. Eager fans using the hashtag #ShipsofCthulhu tracked the ships bearing the long-awaited volumes into port, taking pictures and posting them on social media. Vice-President Michael O’Brien said, ""The response from Chaosium fans has been overwhelmingly positive – even the Call of Cthulhu fans who’ve had to be very patient."" Moon Design brought on editor James Lowder. Lowder, who is known for what Meints described as, ""His strong and long-standing advocacy for creators,"" became the consulting editor for fiction and immediately began to settle outstanding debts with writers and artists. Lowder said of the situation, ""Where other publishers in similar rough straits have walked away from their obligations, Greg, Sandy, and the new Chaosium management team have consistently done the right thing by their writers and editors, and the backers for the long overdue Kickstarter, a group I also belong to. They brought me on as a consultant to help them identify debt and pay the fiction creators what they are owed. That’s just what we’ve done. I’m proud to be part of those efforts."" Matthew Sanderson , a Cthulhu writer who worked with both old management and Moon Design, said that the new team is much more communicative. He added, ""They’ve been great (in person and in writing) whenever I’ve had any dealings with them."" Chaosium seems to have risen again from the dust, like a Lovecraftian wizard summoned forth from his essential salts. A Kickstarter for the classic RuneQuest game funded in January, and backer rewards were printed and ready to ship in three months, which certainly raises confidence in the Moon Design management team. However, a question lingers. Why would Moon Design Productions invest such considerable time and even more considerable amounts of money, in reviving another company’s dead Kickstarter? Paying Old Debts President Rick Meints explained their actions, saying, ""[We] decided to help save Chaosium for a number of reasons. All four of us grew up with the company and have loved their games for decades. We also approach this as a long-term investment that can succeed with a great deal of hard work. The world of tabletop gaming is far richer with Chaosium in it, and we are proud to help ensure it continues doing so."" CFO Neil Robinson explains that the success of Chaosium is personal for Moon Design. He said, ""The four of us would have never met without RuneQuest, the first Chaosium RPG... [When] we met, we were living in four different countries across three continents."" And so Chaosium, while under new management, stays in the family. Special thanks to the Chaosium/Moon Design team.

2083,"Premium gas sounds like it’s something special, but it actually translates into paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars. That's what we found after running tests at our 327-acre track. While some cars require premium gas, many others simply carry a recommendation to use it. We wanted to see whether you can save money by using regular gas in cars that merely carry the recommended premium fuel label. Testing at the Consumer Reports Track To find out whether using regular gas in a vehicle that recommends premium gas had any effect on fuel economy or acceleration, we evaluated two models: the 2015 Acura TLX four-cylinder and the 2016 Nissan Maxima V6. Each recommends but does not require that the owner put in premium gas—guidance found on the placard on the backside of their fuel-filler door and often explained in greater detail within the owner’s manual. So long as you fuel the vehicle in accordance with the manual, you are protected by the powertrain warranty. In order to purge the cars of premium that could be in the fuel system, we drove them nearly dry, then ran through a full tank of regular gas before starting testing. All tests were conducted following our stringent fuel economy test protocol, with consumption measured through an inline fuel meter. Both sedans achieved the same fuel economy when tested with regular fuel as with premium. During this testing, the cars felt and sounded the same; we did not experience any engine pinging or knocking noise in either car when using regular fuel. The owner's manuals indicate that you might notice a decrease in performance when running on regular, but our test results say otherwise. The 0-60 mph acceleration times were identical in the TLX and Maxima on regular and premium gas. We contacted Acura and Nissan, asking both why they recommend premium gas. An Acura spokesperson referred us to the TLX’s owner's manual, which states, ""Use of lower octane gasoline can cause occasional metallic knocking noise in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance."" A Nissan spokesperson wrote in an email that ""it is possible for the same performance to be realized using non-premium fuel."" But the spokesperson did add that there could be some conditions where performance—which includes fuel economy—might be compromised, such as on extremely hot days. Nissan goes on to say that it is recommended to use premium fuel to guarantee advertised performance. Money in Your Pocket While gas prices remain historically low, the cost difference between regular and premium gas has increased over the past year. In 2015, there was a 39-cent difference between regular and premium, according to fuelgaugereport. But as of this writing, there is a 47-cent difference in the national average price of regular and premium gas. And given the lower pump prices overall, that 8 cents is an even greater percentage. Below we highlight the potential savings using regular instead of premium fuel assuming 12,000 miles per year and current gas prices. Fuel Economy Savings Per Year 30 mpg $188 25 mpg $226 20 mpg $282 15 mpg $376 What's the Downside? So it's okay to use regular even if the manufacturer recommends using premium gas. But check your car owner’s manual before making the switch, and remember that some automakers say premium is required. Wondering about the long-term effects of switching to regular fuel? Here's what we know: In conversations with manufacturers, never was there a connection made with using premium fuel for reliability reasons. The manufacturers only talk about higher octane in terms of performance. What's more, in the Acura owner's manual, Acura only recommends using ""top-tier detergent gasoline""—which can be of any octane grade, regular or premium—for performance and reliability reasons. But there is nothing in the manual that equates premium gas with improved reliability. That said, if you make the switch and think your car is performing sluggishly, or you hear knocking or pinging, go back to premium fuel. Beyond these test findings, it is key to note our car reliability data consistently show that the most dependable cars tend to be those running on regular fuel.",paying extra for a higher octane without a performance or fuel economy benefit for many cars

2090,"It’s every high schooler’s dream. But when this popular football player was voted homecoming king, he rejected the crown for a very unexpected reason. Now, this young man’s unorthodox response is sending shockwaves throughout his high school and around the world. This is powerful. Max Akin is Fossil Ridge High School’s favorite quarterback — and he’s a good one at that. In the first half of Friday’s homecoming game, the senior quarterback secured an impressive 200 passing yards, 60 rushing yards, and four touchdowns. But what this talented young quarterback did at half-time trumped his impressive performance on the field. And it’s simply beautiful. Seconds after Max Akin was crowned homecoming king, he took a knee to present his crown to fellow nominee and friend, K.L. Norwood, who has cerebral palsy. ""I think it should’ve gone to the person who positively uplifts the school and everybody around him,"" Max said, ""and that person is K.L., for sure."" ""I didn’t know when I would have the right time to do it,"" Akin told WFAA. ""But I saw K.L., came over and gave him a hug, and I knew that he wanted that crown more than anything."" Since then, Max Akin’s unusual gesture has taken the internet by storm. And it’s a beautiful sight to behold as the shared crown reminds the world that inviting someone into the spotlight is always sweeter than hogging it.

2102,"How to Not Betray Your Introverted Self When Searching For Love There was a pick up line I was told to use years ago when I was first figuring out my dating life as an introvert. It was in an Night Club I visited when I was in Africa for work. The line was supposed to be funny, but also convey ""my higher status simply because I was an American"". I wish I could say I felt like a douche saying it back then. But at the time I had no other alternatives. I wanted to impress her and figured everyone outside of the United States loved us. But I do feel like a douche now admitting that I said that line. Back then, the concept of accepting my natural personality wasn’t a concept. No one told me I by simply working on enhancing my own characteristics and accepting who I was, I wouldn’t have to rely on tactics or lines. The frustrating part is that this uncertainty drives many introverts insane because they pretend to be an extrovert when attempting to find love. They go to parties or environments that pushes them out of their comfort zone and make them do things they’re not comfortable with. They struggle with simple decisions such as determining who ‘exciting they should by’, ‘how to show they’re exciting’ and ‘how to impress an entire room’. Should it be the night clubs? Or perhaps Julie’s party? As introverts, it’s not the problem that we assume we’ll find love in an environment filled with people. It’s believing we have to change ourselves and our daily routines just to find the love of our life. I once made the mistake of pretending I was a party animal to get a girl’s attention. Sure, I managed to date her. But at the cost of going out every night and spending more energy than what I could afford. Let me ask you this: Why would you ever want to change the way you behave just to get someone’s affection? If they’re happy with you but you’re not happy with yourself because you know you’re living a lie, can you really consider that happiness? Why would you put in the effort to change the way you naturally behave in exchange for someone who’s naturally living an extroverted lifestyle? The idea of finding a girlfriend at a Nightclub seems amazing. But let’s say you won a girl’s heart from a Nightclub called ‘Scream N’ Go’. Although you assume you won the battle and it’s all over, the love of your life is going to expect to go out with you Friday and Saturday night. And there’s three routes you’re going to find yourself facing. A. You tell her you don’t want to go and possibly endanger the relationship because you’re not giving her the excitement she assumed she’ll receive dating you. B. Make her realize you’re not the party animal she hoped for and cause her to possibly leave you. C. Allow her to accept you for who you are and watch Netflix that night. Although the majority of us would love for scenario C to happen, deep in our hearts we know there would only be a 5% chance of that happening. How would this decision affect your life? That you choose to betray your introverted self in exchange for a chance to find love and lose it just as fast. Before you shoot the messenger, don’t get me wrong. There’s nothing wrong with dating an extrovert. My partner is an extrovert and we manage to make it work extremely well. She respects my boundaries as an introvert as I respect her boundaries as an extrovert. While I’m reading or surfing the net, she’s exploring the Safaris or Los Angeles. I act as her reminder that it’s okay to stay in the house and relax as she acts as the reminder I need that there’s an outside world. The problem I see are introverts who believe they have to act a certain way to gain the affection they desire. I love quiet places, but if I’m going to find love, I need to go to a Nightclub called ‘Hot and Heavy’ and hope some girl falls into my arm so I can charm her with my listening skills. Or, I want to find love at this Museum I like to visit but every woman there might be too busy, so I’ll just visit this Dubstep concert. These excuses we give ourselves pushes us away from our own environments and can really screw our chance of actually finding love. Because the way we find love is usually through our ability to listen and charm others with our natural witty comebacks. It’s not playing the charisma king who can charm 10 people simultaneously. Chasing the extrovert lifestyle is something we do when we assume our introvert selves aren’t good enough to attract anyone. Which is why I wanted to point out some heavy reminders to give yourself the next time you’re at home questioning your next decision. Not Giving a Duck You may be more familiar with the phrase, ""Not giving a Fu#$,"" but I’d rather stay away from that word and keep this rated PG. So I’m going to use Duck in its place. ""Not giving a Duck"" is a popular tactic because when you decide you are ""not going to give a Duck"" what you are really doing is not internalizing a woman’s lack of interest. When a girl isn’t into you, it stings. So what does not giving a Duck do? Makes it sting less. Such as the way I replaced the F-bomb for a cute diction, you can replace a woman’s lack of interest as a Duck’s face. But somethings not giving a duck works. It often doesn’t work for me. In fact, I do give a Duck more than I’d like to admit. I certainly give a Duck when a girl wants to go on a date with me. I want her to know I’m happy to share that moment with her. I’m also happy to be brutally honest with her and be clear on what I want in life. If that matches with what she wants, awesome, if not, that’s ok too. ""Not giving a Duck"" can have negative effects. If you ""never give a Duck"" you are lacking the capacity to connect on a deeper human level. You subconsciously push people away. Sometimes it’s required to ""give a Duck"" and put yourself on the line. ESPECIALLY introverts. Doesn’t it seem silly that we really shine with one on one connection, but we’re also supposed to ""not give a Duck"" when given the chance? The Art of Being Tactical I know a lot of you are pretty young here. High school and college age. I’m not too far ahead of you, I’m only 25. I see a lot of stuff in the world of dating advice that is very tactical based. Truth be told, a lot of tactics do work. I’ve actually tested out a few of them. You can ""neg"" a girl and she will think your higher status, and maybe you can hook up with her later. Except intelligent women who value and hold themselves to a higher standard. That’s what you aren’t taught. Sure, you can hook up with as many emotionally empty, approval seeking women as you want. If that’s your goal, you’re probably on the right track. I’m not here to say who’s right and wrong. What didn’t work for me with pick up artist material is that I’m an analytical introvert. Sometimes I get TOO MUCH in my head. I don’t feel natural walking up to large groups of people and starting a conversation. I also felt like a total tool using other people’s words and routines. But you know what? I found a lot of success with not only dating and women, but my social life. The Art of Rejection The term ""rejection"" is completely ridiculous when it comes to dating or relationship advice. Rejection is a term used in business. What High School seniors face when their college admission deny them. Authors trying to get their book published get rejected because it needs improvement. Networks who pitch their reality show idea in LA get rejected because it’s not trashy enough for MTV. When a girl isn’t into you. she’s not into you. No big deal. Rejection is a choice YOU make about the event. If you want to decide that you are ugly, not funny enough, or not confident enough because a girl simply wasn’t interested, that’s your choice. Or you can wake up and realize the world doesn’t revolve around you and stop taking it personally. She’s not into me? Thank you for not letting us waste each other’s time. The LAST thing I want is a date out of pity. Trust me, it isn’t worth it. The Act of Desperation The interesting thing about desperation is that it creeps into our lives one hit at a time. Just like a crack addict slowly sacrifices who they are just to get one more hit. It’s no different for guys wanting to figure out how to connect with women. It’s not easy to admit desperation. It feels dirty, and we want to keep up our appearance of being strong and holding it together. After all, that’s being ""alpha"" isn’t it? When I was still single and I found out my friend had just gotten laid, I felt incredibly jealous. Of course I cheered him on like any good friend should but it ate me alive. ""Duck! What am I doing wrong? I HAVE to get laid soon or else I will fall behind."" I started reading more pick up artist material, watch people from Real Social Dynamics and I started treating getting girls like it was some kind of numbers game. ""Tonight it will happen. I just need the perfect line and mix of whiskey and I’ll nail it!"" I never nailed it. It’s a numbers game Actually, no it isn’t. It’s a numbers game if you are desperate, try the same thing every time and spray and pray when you go out to parties. These are the common mistakes that I see the most. Using the same line and routine every time is a numbers game Getting really hammered hoping you say the perfect string of funny lines and witty remarks is a numbers game. Logging onto Tinder and following a copy and pasted formula that some other guy used on his vacation in Hawaii is a numbers game. It’s NOT a numbers game when you have value to add to the world and to women. It’s NOT a numbers game when you find out what kind of women you’re into, and what kind of women are into you. Maybe you like to joke and prefer a woman who doesn’t have a strict attitude and no humor. Maybe you’re more comfortable with someone who likes to spend their time at home watching Netflix instead of stumbling out of some random nightclub. It’s NOT a numbers game when you stop treating social interactions with other people as if it’s a zero sum game. If you’re always looking to gain or add another notch to your belt with women, you will never win. Create An Environment You Thrive In Get involved with group environments where you have common interests. List all the activities you like to do, then search for groups on sites like meetup.com. And if you’re searching for environments to find potential partners, check out: How to Find a Date as an Introvert If you can’t find a group for something you like, then start one. If you like going hiking, find a hiking group. If you like playing video games, go to the next Comic Con. Whatever it is, find a group that you can connect with. For You Analytical Introverts You know you’re good at one on one connection. You know you aren’t the best at the first wave of conversation. There’s nothing more annoying than being in a group environment where you have to share your attention span with several other people. For introverts, all it takes is for you to get in your zone. The zone where it’s one on one, and you’re sitting with her at the coffee shop, and she realizes that you can listen and connect in such a unique way she hardly ever experiences. It’s not approaching someone in a bar or nightclub and persuading her to like you over the sound of loud music and obnoxious people. It’s approaching someone where your amazing personality and interest in her is the main attraction. You don’t have to change who you are. You don’t need to become more outgoing or extroverted. You just need to set yourself up for success. Stop Doing Things YOU Don’t Want To Do If you hate going to the bars or networking events and go because you feel like you have to meet women there, stop. Create the life that you want. I am still terrible at meeting people in loud environments with excessive alcohol. For a while I tried to improve. Then I realized that I’d rather put my head through a window than try to talk to one more drunk girl about her psychology major. Now I do activities I like. It’s a lot easier for me to meet people when I know they are there for similar reasons. There was a time where I joined a writing group, a group of artists, and even a dance group.

2103,"HANOI, Vietnam — Four prison guards in northern Vietnam have been suspended for alleged negligence after a female inmate, on death row for drug trafficking, became pregnant, which means her death sentence will be commuted to life in prison once her child is born, state media reported Tuesday. The Thanh Nien newspaper said Nguyen Thi Hue, 42, was arrested in 2012 for drug trafficking and sentenced to death in 2014. A court rejected her appeal the same year. The paper reported that while in prison, Hue paid a male inmate $2,300 to help her get pregnant. It said the 27-year-old male inmate twice put his sperm in a plastic bag with a syringe in a mutually agreed place and Hue inseminated herself. She became pregnant and is expected to give birth in about two months. Under Vietnamese law, Hue will have her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment for having a child under 3 years of age. Police in Quang Ninh province were not available for comment Tuesday. In 2007, two prison guards in the northern province of Hoa Binh were sentenced to up to five years in prison for abuse of power for allowing a female inmate to get pregnant with a male inmate.",It said the 27-year-old male inmate twice put his sperm in a plastic bag with a syringe in a mutually agreed place and Hue inseminated herself.

Last summer, the ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star was dating Houston Rockets stud James Harden, but they split shortly after her estranged husband, ex NBA stud Lamar Odom, nearly died of an overdose at a Nevada brothel. She was also linked to NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. earlier this year after they both attended Drake's Memorial Day bash. Photos emerged of Khloe sitting on his lap, and they were in Las Vegas together a few days prior to that. A source at the party said they definitely seemed into each other. They both denied any kind of romance, which many people on the Internet think could be a blessing for Odell, considering the so-called ""Kardashian Curse"" -- James Harden had a dismal season last year after their romance; Lamar's drug issues are well documented; former Minnesota Timberwolves basketballer Rashad McCants, who she also dated in 2008, is a free agent these days; and former running back boyfriend Derrick Ward has left the NFL altogether.

2107,"It’s no wonder so many parents dread flying with young children. Caring for babies in ridiculously tight quarters while trying to avoid disturbing fellow passengers is a tall order in and of itself. Combine that with the fact that few aspects of air travel, with the exception of pre-boarding the plane, are designed for the comfort of parents traveling with children, and the whole experience seems understandably challenging. But one stranger’s kind act demonstrated how easy it is to make the situation far more pleasant for everyone. On a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month, a passenger sitting next to a pregnant mom traveling alone with her 20-month-old son offered to help soothe the toddler by walking the aisles of the plane. Another passenger who witnessed the act said she was moved to tears. ""...Her son was upset and fussy. [The man] did not complain, he just told her that he was a DAD [sic], and wanted to help her so she could rest,"" passenger Andrea Byrd wrote in a Sept. 5th Facebook post, which was shared over 100,000 times. In an interview with ""Today,"" the mom, Monica Nelson, said she was surprised when her fellow passenger offered to help, but she was grateful because flying without her husband makes her nervous.

In laying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's first goal against Swansea, this afternoon, Rooney registered his fourth assist of the season, which is double the amount Mesut Ozil currently has to his name for the current campaign. Ozil has made a name for himself with his ability to assist his Arsenal teammates, claiming his second of the season during the North London derby, today.

2112,"On Thursday night, 13-year-old Jairam Hathwar and 11-year-old Nihar Janga were declared co-winners of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, making this the ninth bee in a row to name an Indian-American victor. In honor of their victory, Slate revisits Ben Paynter’s story, originally published in 2010, which explains Indian-Americans’ prowess in spelling competitions. It is reprinted below. This April's North South Foundation bee in Shawnee, Kan., might seem like an obscure place to find the spelling world's two biggest stars. Mostly, it looked like the sort of geeky local bee I might have attended as a kid—except everyone there was Indian. Inside Shawnee's Hindu Temple and Cultural Center, 23 awkward kids took turns passing a microphone back and forth in a hushed beige auditorium. No spotlights, no podium, just cringe-inducing feedback on the P.A. system. And for the record, the spelling was a-t-r-o-c-i-o-u-s. Just three of the first 10 contestants spelled their words correctly. At one point, a poor kid paced in circles and clutched his crotch before misspelling beleaguered and sprinting off to the restroom. Amid it all, 13-year-old Kavya Shivashankar pronounced words from a fold-out judging table as her father, Mirle, emceed in a sharp dark suit. Kavya, the 2009 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion, is a spelling superstar complete with signature move: She air-writes each word across her palm before speaking it. Kavya and Mirle—her innovative, ever-enthusiastic coach—were at the small-time competition to pay homage. Over the past two decades, tournaments like this one—a regional qualifier for the North South Foundation's spelling league—have become a breeding ground for Scripps contenders. These minor-league competitions help kids as young as 6 years old work out the spelling kinks at an early age. The result has been an Indian-American dynasty at the National Spelling Bee. Consider the facts: Indian-Americans make up about 1 percent of the U.S. population; this year, an estimated 30 NSF-ers will compete at Scripps, 11 percent of the 273-kid field. Recent winners include Sai R. Gunturi from Dallas, who nonchalantly reassembled pococurante for a national title in 2003. Sameer Mishra from West Lafayette, Ind., nailed guerdon in 2008. And four-time finalist Shivashankar made it back-to-back titles for North South Foundation competitors last year, air-writing Laodicean for the win. If Shivashankar hadn't come through, it's possible another North South graduate would have: Four other NSF kids cracked the top 10 behind her. The NSF circuit consists of 75 chapters run by close to 1,000 volunteers. The competitions, which began in 1993, function as a nerd Olympiad for Indian-Americans—there are separate divisions for math, science, vocab, geography, essay writing, and even public speaking—and a way to raise money for college scholarships for underprivileged students in India. There is little financial reward for winners (just a few thousand dollars in college scholarships) compared with the $40,000 winning purse handed out each year by Scripps. Still, more than 3,000 kids participated in NSF's spelling events this year due in part to what NSF founder Ratnam Chitturi calls a sort of Kavya Effect. ""Most American kids look up to sports figures,"" he says. ""Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model."" Just as Kavya Shivashankar has inspired the next wave of Indian spellers, Kavya found her bee mojo during the post- Spellbound boom. Before Spellbound, the 2002 documentary that featured Indian-American Nupur Lala's run to the 1999 Scripps title, many first-generation South Asian parents saw NSF as a way for their children to assimilate—the best way to understand a culture, after all, is to learn its language. They used the North South Foundation events as a sort of SAT prep, teaching their children to use phonetics, etymology, and word roots to suss out answers. ""Our focus is not on competition,"" says Chitturi. ""Winning becomes an outcome of you focusing on learning. You are competing against yourself, not these other people."" After Spellbound, that changed a bit. After Balu Natarajan (winning word: milieu) became the first Indian-American to win Scripps back in 1985, he went on to a career in sports medicine. When Lala did it in 1999 with logorrhea, she became a movie star. (OK, a movie star and a neuroscientist.) Kavya has called Lala an inspiration—the license plate of Mirle's teal minivan reads ""SPL BND."" She's far from alone. In 2002, NSF had less than 20 chapters pulling in about 500 mostly middle-school-age spellers. Then pop culture galvanized an expansion to elementary schoolers; today, six times as many students compete in North South Foundation spelling events. ""The parents were just excited,"" Chitturi says. ""They saw that it was a possibility [to win the National Spelling Bee]."" It's no coincidence, then, that in the last decade North South Foundation has transformed from an SAT prep course into a training ground for Scripps. It wasn't too long ago that NSF standouts like Kamran Riaz and 2000 champion Ashley Thakur didn't compete at the National Spelling Bee. Riaz, for one, remembers NSF as a nice ""alternative"" to Scripps. Thakur's thoughts on the National Spelling Bee: ""Not to brag, but I don't think it would be a hard cake to cut,"" she once bragged to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It's not quite right to say that Riaz and Thakur didn't go to nationals because they didn't think it was a big deal. The more significant reason is that they simply weren't eligible. You have to be more than a great speller to qualify for the National Bee—you also have to live in a school district with a sponsoring newspaper or community organization. These days, parents seem to be paying a lot more attention to such logistics. When Mirle Shivashankar realized in 2005 that there was just one Scripps sponsor in all of Kansas, he beat the bushes to ensure that more kids from the state—his daughter, for one—would have the chance to go to nationals. Kavya subsequently gained all of her berths to the nationals by virtue of a brand-new sponsor, the Olathe News. The North South Foundation could dominate Scripps even further, if more of its spellers were eligible to compete. In areas with more gifted NSFers than competition zones, the battle to get into Scripps can be intense. Whereas regional North South Foundation competitions are run like standardized tests—the best scores get weighted against a national average to determine the national finalists—Scripps operates more like a crazy single-elimination tournament. The winner in each local bracket funnels into a pool of finalists, who repeat the same process to pick a winner. That can lead to some powerhouse regional showdowns. In San Jose, Calif., for instance, eventual 2009 NSF senior co-champion Ramya Auroprem had to beat out 2009 NSF runner-up Sidarth Jayadev just to make it into last year's National Spelling Bee finals. North South Foundation winners don't have to worry about Kavya Shivashankar anymore—she has retired. At the Shawnee NSF contest this April, Swetha Jasti placed first, with a perfect score that qualified her for NSF nationals later this summer. But unfortunately for Jasti, she won't make it to Scripps this year. When the National Spelling Bee starts up this week, their region will be represented by a surprise challenger: Kavya's 8-year-old sister, Vanya, who drubbed Jasti in the National Spelling Bee's Olathe qualifier.","""Most American kids look up to sports figures,"" he says. ""Indian kids are more interested in education, and they finally have a role model."""

Prepare to be amazed as the two megastars share in an awesome duet of ""Driven To Tears,"" a 1980 track from Sting’s band, The Police. Downey Jr. was a bit nervous to stand alongside his musical hero, not wanting to disappoint him on his birthday, but the second he opens his mouth it’s clear there’s nothing to be nervous about.

2117,"Masturbation isn’t only enjoyable by yourself (although let’s be honest, it’s fun alone, too.) You can also utilize what you learn in your alone time to help you have more fun (and more orgasms) with a partner. Let’s talk about how! Train Your Clitoris to be more Responsive The clitoris is supremely sensitive, and can essentially be ""trained"" to orgasm from different types of stimulation. If you want your partner to be able to make you orgasm when you’re together, you can try exposing your clitoris to a wider range of sensation when you masturbate. The more ways you can teach yourself to reach orgasm, the easier it will be to get there with a partner. Just like with male masturbation, there are an endless number of ways to masturbate. A trip down the internet rabbit hole turns up suggestions that require everything from molding clay to turkey basters to Mardi Gras beads, but this Reddit thread has more approachable tips. Here are some of easy things to try: Try new strokes. Change the speed or pressure that you usually use. Use a different number of fingers. Get into new body positions. On your stomach or on your hands and knees are popular with a lot of women. Grind up against soft objects like pillows or blankets, or hard ones like your heel or the edge of a desk. Use a handheld showerhead or the bathtub faucet. Having a tried-and-true method is great, but it can be a ton of fun to learn new ways of pleasuring yourself. If you have a hard time making the switch to a new technique, there are a few things to try. First, try alternating between your old stand-by and a new technique of your choosing in one or two minute cycles. Try getting yourself right to the edge of orgasm with your usual method, then changing to the new one at the last possible second. Each time you give this a shot, try to lengthen the time you spend with the new technique. Another way to do it is to go cold-turkey on your typical routine. Knowing that you can’t rely on Old Faithful on can give you more motivation to make it work with the new technique. Show Your Partner how to do It There’s no need to be shy about your masturbation habits! If you want your partner to make you orgasm, one of the best things you can do is show your partner how you masturbate. Women who masturbate on their stomachs or by grinding against objects tend to be a little more embarrassed about masturbating in front of their partners than women who masturbate on their backs, with their hands, but there’s no reason it should be this way. Truly, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way of masturbating, and there’s no reason to be ashamed of what you need to give yourself pleasure. Your partner would be crazy not to enjoy the show! Start off by masturbating on your own for a few minutes while your partner watches. Then have your partner put their hand over yours so they can get a feel for what you’re doing. You can do this whether you’re using your hands or a vibrator. Give them verbal feedback, like ""go in a circle"" or ""just a bit more pressure"". Once they’ve got a sense of what you’re doing, you can try tag-teaming your clitoris. Touch yourself for a few minutes, then let your partner take over for a few minutes, then repeat. Switching off like this will help your body get used to being stimulated by another person. Give Yourself a Hand There’s also no shame in masturbating to completion when you’re with a partner. This is a great strategy for women who can’t orgasm from penetration (i.e. 70% of us), or who experience a significant mismatch of orgasmic timing with their partners. Positions like doggystyle or woman on top make it incredibly easy to slip your hand or a vibrator down to your clitoris. You can also get yourself off first before moving on to intercourse (this is a good tip for women who experience sexual pain, since having an orgasm beforehand can help your muscles relax). Another fun thing to do is use your own hand on your clitoris while your partner uses their hand inside of you (more tag-teaming!). Or you can mix it up by having a session where you both masturbate in front of each other, that way everyone gets in on the masturbation fun! Making it easier to orgasm with a partner is yet another reason why masturbation can be so amazing. Put those fingers to work!

2118,"Yes, the pumpkin beers did start to flood the store shelves back in July, an annoying trend that started several years ago. But have you noticed there seems to be less pumpkin beer this year overall? It seems to be true. Brewers, including many in Upstate New York, have either stopped making pumpkin beers or are cutting back production. It's a big change: Pumpkin (or pumpkin-spice) beer was one of the biggest trends in craft beer in the past five years. The change dates back, in part, to the nationwide overproduction of pumpkin beers that reach a peak last fall. Pumpkin beers sat on shelves, and in some cases brewers had to buy it back from their distributors. It was the ""Great Pumpkin Debacle of 2015,"" said Gregg Stacy, director of sales and marketing for Ithaca Beer Co. Ithaca this year discontinued the fall seasonal beer, Country Pumpkin, which it had introduced in 2011. Overproduction is just part of the problem, Stacy said. Ithaca is moving away from seasonals in any case, and is looking for different beers to add to its portfolio. This year, it launched Hellish Lager, a more traditional light-colored German-style beer (such traditional beers may be the ""new"" trend in craft beer). Hellish Lager is ""the anti-pumpkin ale,"" Stacy said, noting that the pumpkin ale was never a big part of its production in any case. ""Pumpkin beer is cute, but it's not really what we do."" Change is coming across the spectrum, from the biggest craft brewers to the smallest. Large brewers like Southern Tier in Jamestown (maker of Pumking and Warlock) are cutting back production, according to a story published at forbes.com. That story also noted big pumpkin producers like Harpoon Brewing in Massachussetts and Shipyard Brewing of Maine cut the volume of pumpkin beer they're making this year. Samuel Adams, which had been making two pumpkin beers, cut back to one this year, Forbes reported. In Utica, the relatively large Saranac Brewery (Matt Brewing Co.) still has its Pumpkin Ale for 2016, but tweaked the recipe to make the flavor ""more more prominent and robust,"" according to its digital marketer Anthony Jackson. Smaller breweries Upstate are paying close attention to the market. Cortland Beer Co. plans to make two batches of its Pumpkin Ale this year, but may not do a third, as it did last year. That was one batch too many in 2015, said Cortland Beer president Dan Cleary. Cortland expects to fill its accounts in the immediate Cortland area, but Cleary has found other markets, like Ithaca, have experienced pumpkin beer overload. ""I asked an Ithaca account about taking pumpkin this year, and he said, 'naaah.' "" Cleary said. In addition to the number of breweries that jumped into the pumpkin market in recent years, the early start in delivery to markets and bars may contribute to the fatigue factor, Cleary said. ""Definitely by Thanksgiving, it's dead,"" Cleary said. ""Maybe even earlier."" Even a brewery that also operates its own pumpkin patch is cutting back. Critz Farms in Cazenovia is making just a small batch, said owner Matthew Critz. ""We heard about the over saturation last year, so we were careful this year,"" said Critz, who makes hard apple cider and beer at his farm, where he grows everything from apples and pumpkins to Christmas trees and makes maple products. From a famer's perspective, Critz doesn't think the cut back in pumpkin beers will hurt many growers. Most pumpkin beers base their recipes on the spices, and many also use squash instead of actual pumpkin anyway. (The pumpkin or squash adds body to the beer, but not much flavor). ""Frankly, our brewery and Empire (Brewing Co. in Syracuse) are some of the only ones that use real pumpkin anyway,"" Critz said. For those who still crave authentic pumpkin beers, his Critz Farms Pumpkin Ale may fit the bill: It's made with real pumpkins, not over-spiced and the pumpkins are drizzled with Critz maple syrup before they're roasted and added to the brew. ""Pumpkin beer became sort of a big marketing thing,"" Critz said. ""We can take it back to being a real farm product."" Genesee Brewery in Rochester plans $49 million expansion, with state help Don Cazentre writes about food, beverages, restaurants and bars for syracuse.com and The Post-Standard.

2123,"The connection between emotional stress and psychological illness remains fraught with uncertainty. It is no secret that certain psychological illnesses, like depression for example, have physical symptoms. According to the NHS, sufferers of clinical depression may exhibit changes in appetite and weight, unexplained aches and pains, disturbed sleep or, if you are a woman, changes to your menstrual cycle. Multiple studies have investigated the extent to which your nervous system, which influences emotions, can predispose you to physical illnesses. Dr Esther Sternberg, whose seminal work The Balance Within seeks to reconcile the central nervous system and the immune system, identifies a link – though not a causal one – between emotional state and inflammatory diseases: The same parts of the brain that control the stress response ... plays an important role in susceptibility and resistance to inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. And since it is these parts of the brain that also play a role in depression, we can begin to understand why it is that many patients with inflammatory diseases may also experience depression at different times in their lives. Sternberg argues that, while feelings do not cause or cure disease, the biological makeup of both are similar enough as to affect the other. Many of the nerve pathways and molecules underlying both psychological responses and inflammatory disease are the same, making predisposition to one set of illnesses likely to go along with predisposition to the other. In another study by the American Psychological Association, 217 people were questioned about their work, and how stressed they were. Their saliva samples were also taken. Results found that those who exhibited low self-esteem or self-blame tended to have less immunoglobin-A, making them more susceptible to respiratory infections. In a separate study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 270 participants were told to think of an event that made them feel either happy, or sad. Then, they were given a flu vaccine and monitored for six months. Participants who exhibited better immunity – and more antibodies in their blood – were those with the strongest activity in their pre-frontal cortex, associated with positive thoughts.

2130,"Do Americans love their neighbors as themselves? Although ""love"" might be pushing it, most Americans are pretty happy with their neighbors. To understand how Americans feel about their neighbors, Trulia surveyed 3,014 American adults on September 25-27, 2013. Hey-Diddly-Ho, Neighborino! Let's start with the good news. Unlike Homer Simpson, who lives next door to the annoying Ned Flanders, two thirds of all Americans like their neighbors, and that number jumps to 80% among people who know their neighbors' names. But even among people who don't know their neighbors' names, 53% like their neighbors. Does renting versus owning make a difference? You bet. Homeowners are much more likely than renters are to like their neighbors (74% for owners, 58% for renters) and to know their neighbors' names (61% for owners, 39% for renters). How about geography? Looking across regions, Midwesterners are most likely to know their neighbors' names: 60% do, compared with 51% in the Northeast and the South, and 49% in the West. But perhaps Westerners are easier-going, since they're the most likely to like their neighbors (72% in the West vs. 67% nationally), despite being the least likely to know their names. More suburbanites, too, like their neighbors and know their names than people who live in more urban areas. % who generally like their neighbors % who know their neighbors' names Owners 74% 61% Renters 58% 39% Northeast 67% 51% Midwest 67% 60% South 65% 51% West 72% 49% Urban 65% 46% Suburban 68% 54% Very few people - just 5% - say they dislike their neighbors, and only 5% are thinking about moving away because of them. If a disagreement arose with a neighbor, 61% would try to fix the conflict by getting to know their neighbor better and patching up the relationship, while only 4% would get into a fight or argument. All in all, Americans should consider themselves lucky to have such good neighborly relationships. Most didn't plan it that way: in fact, few people considered their prospective neighbors as a ""very important"" factor when they chose their current home. The cost and condition of the home, as well as the location of the neighborhood, were far more important considerations. Few People Said Neighbors Were ""Very Important"" in Choosing Homes Consideration When Choosing Current Home % ""very important"" Cost of home 57% Condition of home 54% Location of neighborhood 46% Character of neighborhood 37% Size of home 30% Neighbors 16% Despite neighbors taking a back seat compared with other considerations when choosing a home, harmony reigns in neighborhoods across America. Won't You Be My Neighbor? Even though the majority of Americans like their neighbors, most are picky: 75% prefer that their neighbors have particular traits, characteristics, or behaviors. Among all respondents (not just those with preferences), 35% said it was important to them that their neighbors are homeowners, including 51% of respondents who were homeowners themselves. More than race, age, education, politics, and religion, one in three (33%) Americans said it was important that they and their neighbors speak the same language. Among the respondents who really care who their neighbors are - that is, those that said that the neighbors were a very important consideration when choosing their home - 40% want neighbors who speak the same language. Even though only 10% of respondents said it was important that neighbors are of the same race or ethnicity as they are, language was important - and language differences often go hand in hand with racial or ethnic differences. ""It is important to me that my neighbors...""

Suburbanites were more likely than urbanites to want neighbors who are homeowners (38% for suburbanites vs. 29% for urbanites) and who speak the same language (34% vs. 27%). It's also more important for suburbanites to have neighbors who have a similar family structure (like married, having kids, etc.), race or ethnicity, and religion. Urbanites, however, were more likely than suburbanites to want neighbors who keep the same hours, have same education level, and have same political views. (All of the differences called out in this paragraph are statistically significant at the 10% level.) Furthermore, urbanites yearn for a greater sense of community. The number one thing people wish their neighborhood had more of is local restaurants. But the second most popular wish in urban areas is for a stronger sense of community, which 26% of urban dwellers want, compared with only 20% of suburbanites. ""I wish my neighborhood had more ...""

Some neighbors, even the friendly ones, can be judgmental, passive-aggressive, or be a little on the nosy side. One fifth of Americans say they judge their neighbors based on the appearance or condition of their home or property. But passive-aggressive neighbors are more common than judgy neighbors: 31% would actively ignore a neighbor they were in a disagreement with, and 30% would complain to a higher authority. Finally, some neighbors get awfully curious when a neighbor's home goes up for sale: 27% check out the home online, and 11% attend the open house. Statement % choosing or agreeing with statement If I were in a disagreement with a neighbor, I would actively ignore them 31% If I were in a disagreement with a neighbor, I would complain to landlord, homeowners' association, police, or other local authority 30% When a home goes up for sale in my neighborhood, I check out the home on an online real estate site 27% I judge my neighbors on the appearance or condition of their home or property 20% When a home goes up for sale in my neighborhood, I attend the open house 11% Still, most Americans like their neighbors - despite the fact most would prefer that their neighbors are homeowners, speak the same language, or have other traits similar to themselves - even if they don't know their names. And although few people say that their prospective neighbors were a very important consideration when they chose their current home, most end up liking their neighbors after all. METHODOLOGY This survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Interactive on behalf of Trulia from September 25-27, 2013 among 3,014 adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables, please contact pr@trulia.com. To compare ""city"" versus ""suburb,"" we classify neighborhoods as either urban or suburban based on how dense or spread out the housing is. We define urban neighborhoods as those where a majority of the housing is apartments, attached townhouses, or other multi-unit buildings; suburban neighborhoods are those where a majority of the housing is single-family detached houses. We used this methodology rather than simply identifying the biggest city in a metro as ""urban"" and treating the rest of the metro as the ""suburbs,"" as other reports on cities-versus-suburbs often do. The problem with using city boundaries is that many neighborhoods outside of the biggest city are actually much more urban than some neighborhoods within a city's boundary. For instance, our definition classifies Hoboken, NJ, Central Square in Cambridge, MA, and Santa Monica - which are all very dense - as urban neighborhoods, even though they're outside the city boundaries of New York, Boston, and Los Angeles, respectively.",most Americans are pretty happy with their neighbors
2134,"Is it beneficial for our immune system to expose ourselves to bacteria? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. Answer by Drew Smith, former R&D director at MicroPhage and SomaLogic, on Quora: Beneficial is not quite the word I would use when talking about exposing our immune systems to bacteria. Co-dependent is a bit more accurate. Imagine a tug of war, our immune system on one side and bacteria on the other. Our bodies put just enough energy into our immune systems to ensure that there is an even match - that there is a stable balance between the two sides, what physiologists call homeostasis. Most diseases involve a disruption of homeostasis, either as a cause or a consequence. Because bacteria have always been present in the environment of our ancestors, we've evolved to expect a certain amount of pull from the bacteria on the other side of the rope, and our immune systems are programmed to begin tugging right away. But what happens when one side lets go of the rope? The side that is still pulling collapses in a disorderly heap, and probably gets a few bruises and cuts in the process. So it is with our immune system. It starts pulling, but if no bacteria are pulling back it starts falling all over itself. The result is a variety of autoimmune disorders: asthma, allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis etc.  We have not heard so much about beneficial viruses because we know even less about the virome than we do about the microbiome. But there is some evidence that gut viruses also modulate immune activity and can help prevent or suppress acute viral and bacterial infections.  Our dependence on bacteria and viruses for health makes sense only in light of evolution through natural selection. There are no functions provided by our microbiome that we could not in principle provide ourselves. It is a crazy Rube Goldberg system that would never be created by any rational designer.",Beneficial is not quite the word I would use when talking about exposing our immune systems to bacteria.

According to the Independent, a ""No Man's Sky"" player was able to break into the game's code which mentioned something about the Xbox One. Neogaf user Hugo Peters reportedly found code within the ""No Man's Sky"" PC version software that licenses the Havok physics engine and allows it to be used on the Xbox One. However, it doesn't mean that No Man's Sky Xbox One release is happening anytime soon. During an interview with the Daily Star, when Hello Games' Sean Murray was asked if ""No Man's Sky"" will make it to the Xbox One, he said he didn't know what exactly he was allowed to disclose about ""No Man's Sky"" or the possibility of a Xbox One version of the game.

2138,"*Jay Z voice* I got 99 problems and a certain film critic is definitely, maybe, probably one of them. 1. Fact: Jordan Peele’s Get Out is one of the best-reviewed films of 2017. The thriller sits at a very impressive 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Peele’s directorial debut recently crossed the oh-so-coveted $100 million mark at the domestic box office too. 2. At one point, the film held steady with a 100% fresh score — but that all came to a halt when one reviewer ripped the project. 3. National Review’s Armond White described Get Out in the headline of his review as the ""return of the get-whitey movie."" In the piece, White critiqued Peele by comparing him to former president Barack Obama, saying that the film ""exploits racial discomfort,"" and asserting that the characters of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rod (Lil Rel Howery) ""are not complex beings,"" instead describing them as ""attitudes."" 4. Get Out actor Lakeith Stanfield definitely didn’t hide his thoughts about White’s review on Twitter. Stanfield later deleted the tweet. 5. The movie still sits at 99% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, even though tons of other glowing reviews have since come in: It now has more than 200 fresh reviews to the one rotten one. But it’ll never get back to 100%. 6. ""We round to the nearest whole number, with two exceptions,"" a representative for Rotten Tomatoes told BuzzFeed News. ""We don’t round up to 100%, and we don’t round down to 0%. We reserve those absolutes for movies where every single review is fresh or every single review is rotten."" 7.

2144,"A racist post sent from a Florida State University student's Vine and Twitter social media accounts set off a firestorm at the Tallahassee campus this week. Mandy Thurston's Vine and Twitter accounts on Wednesday posted the message, ""Welcome to FAMU...I mean FSU. #monkeyseverywhere,"" according to screenshots circulated online (FAMU refers to Florida A&M University, a historically black university). The six-second Vine showed footage of students at the Oglesby Union courtyard on FSU's campus during Market Wednesday, a weekly event where student organizations and vendors put up tables. The Vine post has since been deleted, as has Thurston's Twitter account. Thurston told the Tallahassee Democrat Friday that her accounts had been hacked, and that she's filed a police report about it. Maj. Jim Russell, assistant chief of FSU PD, confirmed to the newspaper that a report was filed this week, but did not provide any details. Prior to the Democrat's report of the alleged hacking, campus police and the FSU administration had announced to the student body that an investigation was underway. Vice President for Student Affairs Mary B. Coburn and Student Government President Rosie Contreras sent a campuswide email Thursday in response to the post: Late yesterday evening (9/4/2013) an inappropriate social media message regarding students at Florida State University and Florida A & M University was brought to the attention of the University. Florida State has zero tolerance for ""racist speech,"" no matter which medium is used to communicate the message.

2146,"Binding politicians, hexing fascists, looking out for humanity and causing trouble: All in a day's work for modern, politically-organized witches.  Witches and the witch-curious caught global attention after announcing they would come together online to cast ""a spell to bind U.S. President Donald Trump and all those who abet him"" last month. (Though that hasn't stopped his flurry of controversial executive orders that have rocked the globe.)  Still, for these internet-savvy witches, one little spell designed to stop someone from doing harm is just the beginning of their plans for political change. Anyone who watched The Craft in the '90s will be familiar with the concept of a binding spell — you probably attempted one in high school after trying to make a friend levitate with light as a feather, stiff as a board. Ideally, the spell to bind Trump would have caused a magically-influenced change of heart and cosmic protection for the downtrodden — and the planet itself.  SEE ALSO: Lana Del Ray calls upon fellow witches to cast spell on Donald Trump Farfetched? Maybe. But this is a long game. As one anonymous group of web-based witches, the Yerbamala Collective, says of their resistance, ""Yerba mala nunca muere."" Translation: A bad weed never dies.    English occultist Aleister Crowley, in the book Magick and Theory and Practice, defines a witch as someone who believes in and practices magic, or ""the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.""  If that sounds somewhat political, that's because it is: In 1941, for example, witches gathered to ""hex Hitler."" Later, in 1967, Beat poet Allan Ginsberg and friends ""exorcised"" the Pentagon. For some who consider themselves witches, to resist is to build spiritual strength and compassion through ritual and discussion. For others, it's about spells cast in private. For still others, the revolution starts with disseminating anti-fascist poetry and casting spells en masse. Old-school methods of street-stomping protests, too, are getting re-witchified.

2148,"The Courage Project, a photo display on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus devoted to empowering survivors of violence and abuse, was vandalized late last week. Photos of a former UNC student who identifies as a relationship-abuse survivor were scratched with the words ""whore"" and ""real shit,"" said Andrea Pino, a UNC student who created the Courage Project. The project was vandalized either late Thursday or early Friday, the Daily Tar Heel reports. University employees discovered the vandalism around 5 a.m. Friday, Pino told HuffPost. Senior Associate Director of the Carolina Union Scott Hudson filed a police report later that morning. The Courage Project is a gallery made up of the photos and testimonials of men and women who have been affected by violence. The display is in the UNC-Chapel Hill Student Union. On its website, the Courage Project is described as ""a celebration of solidarity among all whom have supported the healing, witnessed, or survived sexual or interpersonal violence."" Pino was one of a group of women that filed two complaints against the university earlier this year, spurring an ongoing federal investigation into the school's handling of sexual assaults. A photo of the Courage Project vandalism: ""The recent vandalism paints the picture of the already pervasive culture of rape and harassment at UNC,"" Pino said in an email, ""and that of a national administrative indifference to college sexual violence and harassment."" The dorm where Pino was a resident adviser was targeted in April by vandals who left sexually offensive graffiti and markings on the door to her room. There also was a knife found at the scene. At the time, Pino said she did not believe it was random, noting that in addition to the vandalism of her door, a display for Title IX also was damaged. Title IX is a federal gender equality law, and the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is reviewing whether the university violated the statute in its handling of sexual violence on campus, as a result of Pino's complaint. A photo of the April vandalism: Randy Young, spokesman for UNC's Department of Public Safety, told the Tar Heel that the university is investigating the Courage Project vandalism. ""We take it very seriously just because of the incendiary nature of the text that was scrawled,"" Young said. Julia Da Silva, who helps maintains the photo display, said in a Tar Heel op-ed that the vandalism would not stop their activism around the issue of sexual violence. ""We, creators and participants of the Courage Project, have a response: We refuse to stop telling our stories,"" Da Silva wrote. ""We refuse to tolerate violence on our campus. Last year, students, survivors, activists and allies started something big at UNC. It’s up to all of us to keep the momentum going.""","The Courage Project, a photo display on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus devoted to empowering survivors of violence and abuse, was vandalized late last week."

2155,"In crazy hair news, a college student’s unique wraparound ‘do is making waves (or should we say circles?) on the Internet. When Kevin Sjuts, the sports director of a Nebraska news station, noticed a basketball game attendee with a creative haircut, he had to share it with his followers. The fan had a mostly shaved head, except for a band of hair that wrapped around the top of his head and down each cheek, where it joined his beard, creating a complete oval around his face. ""This is a real haircut spotted in the Nebraska Wesleyan student section,"" Sjuts tweeted with a photo of the guy and some friends who were all unaware that they were being photographed while attending a basketball game against Coe College Wednesday night.

Others wondered if it had to do with hazing, if the wearer of the haircut lost a bet, or if he fell asleep at a party. Of course, he could have just wanted that haircut. ...

2162,"The police were called to the home of an elderly couple in Rome who had been heard in hysterics. When the officers arrived, they found a 94-year-old man and his 89-year-old wife in tears, overcome by loneliness and despair over all the world's terrible news. The Roman officers stayed with them and asked about their long lives together. The couple spoke of their isolation, especially in the summer months, when their neighbors go away. The officers asked if they might look inside the kitchen pantry and then, upon finding some simple ingredients, offered to cook the couple a meal of pasta, butter and cheese. ""Nothing special,"" the police department wrote in Italian on its Facebook page last week. ""But with a precious ingredient: Their humanity."" Loneliness and anguish is not a crime, and the cops could have seen there was no incident and left. But they instead chose to kept the couple company. The department shared the couple's story along with two photos of the husband and wife, married 70 years, eating their pasta with an officer cleaning up at the sink in the background. The post was written with notably poetic flair. It describes Jole and Michele alone at home with only the TV as company. And all the bad news from it was just too much for them to bear. ""Sometimes the loneliness melts into tears. Sometimes it's like a summer storm. It comes suddenly and overtakes one,"" the post read. ""Jole and Michele they love each other.

The Roman police department's post was shared close to 24,000 times, with several thousand commenting on the heartrending yet beautiful tale.

2171,"The House passed a bill on Wednesday that would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s new ozone regulations for perhaps another decade -- a move that could endanger the health of millions of Americans. The EPA’s October 2015 regulations lowered the limit for ground-level ozone pollution -- otherwise known as smog, which forms when nitrogen oxide reacts with volatile organic compounds in the air. The rules had been in the works for seven years, and even the updated standard was not low enough to please a number of public health and environmental groups. But business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that the new standard is too strict and will hurt industry. They scored a win with the House bill, sponsored by Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), which would push back implementation of the rules by 10 years. Olson said in a statement that the bill is simply a ""common sense"" effort to provide ""needed flexibility so that states and localities can adequately achieve new, lower standards with time for compliance."" Business advocates are understandably pleased. ""Manufacturers are encouraged to see House leaders pursue much-needed legislation to reduce the burdens and inflexibilities associated with the 2015 ozone standards,"" said Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, in a statement. But environmental, science and health advocacy groups contend that such a delay would increase dangerous air pollution. On June 7, 116 organizations signed a letter warning that the bill ""could well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead pollution."" The White House has made it clear that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it passed the Senate, releasing a statement on Tuesday that said it ""would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans."" Ozone pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including asthma attacks, wheezing and increased risk of stroke and early death, according to the American Lung Association.

2178,"Ryan Lochte during the men's 200m individual medley final in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games. (Photo: Erich Schlegel, USA TODAY Sports) RIO DE JANEIRO – Seven days after an incident that will in part define the Rio Olympics, details are becoming clearer about what happened during a gas station encounter between four U.S. swimmers and security guards, and not everyone has concluded Ryan Lochte and his teammates are entirely in the wrong or that the account offered by Rio authorities is entirely accurate. Lochte has admitted he exaggerated his initial description of how the four men were stopped in their taxi and robbed by men who flashed badges, as well as his sensational allegation of a gun being held to his forehead. But a narrative of the night’s events – constructed by USA TODAY Sports from witness statements, official investigations, surveillance videos and media reports – supports Lochte’s later account in which he said he thought the swimmers were being robbed when they were approached at a gas station by armed men who flashed badges, pointed guns at them and demanded money. A Brazilian judge says police might have been hasty in determining the security guards, by how they dealt with the swimmers, did not commit a robbery. A lawyer who has practiced in Brazil for 25 years says she does not think the actions of Lochte and teammate Jimmy Feigen constitute the filing of a false police report as defined under Brazilian law. An extensive review of surveillance footage by a USA TODAY Sports videographer who also visited the gas station supports swimmer Gunnar Bentz ’s claim that he did not see anyone vandalize the restroom, an allegation that in particular heightened media portrayals of the four as obnoxious Americans behaving recklessly in a foreign country. Meanwhile, Rio authorities have declined to identify the guards or offer any details beyond confirming they are members of law enforcement who were working a private security detail. As the Rio Games closing ceremony was held Sunday night, all four swimmers had left Brazil. Two of them, Bentz and Jack Conger , face no charges. Feigen paid a settlement to avoid charges and returned home. The case against Lochte, who has been pilloried around the world for his embellished initial account and blamed for offending an entire country as it proudly hosted the Summer Olympics, has yet to proceed. It is clear from all accounts that a Portuguese-English language barrier played a major role in the incident and that a bilingual Brazilian witness who stepped forward at the scene was critical in preventing a tense situation from escalating. The witness, Fernando Deluz, says he got involved after one of the guards pulled a gun on the men. ""As soon as they drew their weapon, that's when I got worried,"" Deluz, a disc jockey, told USA TODAY Sports on Saturday. ""It was also so fast, and what I wanted was to resolve the situation,"" says Deluz, who days later talked to police. ""If it hadn't been for wanting to resolve that, if I hadn't involved myself, I thought – the police chief told me, ‘Man, if you hadn't gone there in that moment, a tragedy could have occurred.’ "" Lochte was contrite about his erroneous original account in an interview that aired Saturday on NBC. ""That’s why I’m taking full responsibility for it, because I overexaggerated that story,"" Lochte told Matt Lauer . ""And if I’d never done that, we wouldn’t be in this mess. ... None of this would have happened, and it was my immature behavior.’’ In a statement released Friday, Bentz confirmed police accounts that indicated Lochte damaged a sign during the incident and got into a ""heated exchange"" with the guards. But Bentz, who said authorities viewed him as a witness and never a suspect in the case, offered a narrative that closely matches Lochte’s revised account that he gave to Lauer three days after the incident. Bentz said his recollection was that money was demanded from the Americans by armed men in order for the swimmers to be allowed to leave. While bystander Deluz and the police said the amount paid was for property vandalized, it is unclear whether the swimmers understood the situation. Bentz, 20, is emphatic that his account is accurate: ""I never made a false statement to anyone at any time,"" he said. A sign in Portuguese announcing the restroom is out of order is taped to the door of a restroom at a Shell gasoline station where US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte claimed to have been robbed. (Photo: Glenn Andrews, USA TODAY Sports) ALCOHOL INVOLVED The swimmers, who were returning to the Olympic Village from a party and stopped at the gas station to use the restroom, acknowledge they had been drinking. Using a Portuguese word that broadly refers to someone under the influence of a substance, Deluz describes them as ""very altered. I can't tell you if it was drinking or drugs."" He describes Lochte as ""the very blond one. He was the one who was most altered."" The statement from Bentz and the narrative offered by Brazilian authorities agree that the swimmers entered a narrow walkway and urinated behind the gas station. The accounts also agree that, at some point, Lochte pulled what Bentz described as a ""loosely attached"" advertising sign from a wall. Deluz described it as a framed canvas that was torn as Lochte pulled it to the ground. At a news conference Thursday, Rio police chief Fernando Veloso characterized the athletes' actions at the gas station as vandalism. He said they also had broken a soap dispenser and mirror inside the restroom. Reports quickly grew that the Americans had trashed the restroom. A USA TODAY Sports videographer who visited the bathroom Thursday found no damage to soap dispensers and mirrors and said none of those items appeared to be new. Some media accounts suggested the men had broken down a door, which USA TODAY Sports also did not observe. Bentz said in his statement that he believes there are surveillance videos shot from different angles that have not been released. He also said he did not see anyone damage the bathroom or even enter it. Of the videos available, including footage from a camera trained on the restroom doors, a review by USA TODAY Sports does not find any showing the swimmers going near the bathrooms. They are not seen entering or coming out of them on those recordings. Deluz said it never came up that night: In the negotiations he brokered between the swimmers and the guards, the only damage mentioned was the sign Lochte tore down. There is no indication in the videos released to date or in the statements that the other three swimmers did anything beyond urinate behind the building. ROBBERY OR ‘PAYMENT’? Deluz said the main point of contention was the swimmers trying to ""flee"" after Lochte damaged the sign. ""What happened really – it's not even the issue of knocking down and breaking the sign,"" Deluz said. ""It was the attitude of the guys of messing up the place and then wanting to leave without a satisfactory resolution."" He said if the men had even said they had no money to pay for the damages but had apologized, he thinks all parties involved would have been understanding. That does not match the account of Bentz, who said the swimmers were held at gunpoint until they paid. ""I gave them what I had in my wallet, which was a $20 bill, and Jimmy gave them 100 reais, which is about $50 in total. They lowered the guns, and I used hand gestures to ask if it was OK to leave, and they said yes,"" he said in his statement. In the NBC interview that aired Saturday, Lochte said, ""It’s how you want to make it look like. Whether you call it a robbery, whether you call it extortion or us just paying for the damages. Like, we don’t know. All we know is there was a gun pointed in our direction and we were demanded to give money.’’ Some local observers following the drama have begun to question the police's quick characterization of the story as a false police report lodged by the swimmers to cover up acts of vandalism or possibly calm a female romantic interest who would be angry about their night of partying. João Batista Damasceno, a Rio judge, does not discard the possibility that the guards' actions could be rightly interpreted as a robbery.

Rio de Janeiro police say that Lochte and three other swimmers lied about the incident and instead vandalized this restroom. (Photo: Glenn Andrews, USA TODAY Sports) ""If they only asked for the amount of the damage, it may not be a robbery,"" Damasceno said in a message to USA TODAY Sports. ""But if the amount taken is higher than the value of the damages, with the use of a weapon by the 'security,' this is robbery."" Damasceno added that even if someone has the right to receive compensation, that does not mean they can determine the amount on their own and take actions such as drawing guns to collect. Brazilian law rarely allows for a person to obtain such a payment through the use of their own force – such disputes should be mediated by the state, he said. Deluz said a station employee had established the cost of the damage at 100 reais, but the swimmers paid about 160 reais, – 100 reais plus a $20 bill. Jeffrey Ostrow, Lochte’s attorney, steadfastly maintains the men were robbed. ""That part of the story will never change,'' Ostrow told USA TODAY Sports in a telephone interview. ""We stand behind that."" Lochte initially claimed that he was robbed of $400 and has yet to say if that was another embellishment. Deluz thinks the men understood they were detained because of the damaged sign, as the broken advertisement was shown to them. An athlete even asked him how much he needed to pay, Deluz says. The disc jockey said he conferred with an employee and responded, ""One hundred money."" When one swimmer finally opened his wallet, it had plenty of cash in it beyond that amount. Had the armed men been robbers, Deluz reasoned, they would have taken all the money. Conger, in his statement, acknowledged Deluz tied the payment to the damaged poster. ""Eventually, a man appeared who was able to translate for us, helping to defuse the situation,"" Conger said. ""We paid some money to compensate them for the torn poster, and returned to the Village in a different taxi."" After the payment was made, Deluz said, everyone calmed down and understood the meaning of the transaction. Deluz said to the athletes, according to his signed testimony to police, ""Bye bye friends! That’s OK?"" and they responded to him, ""Thank you!"" A BADGE FLASHED Lochte has asserted that one of the guards flashed a police badge at the swimmers. In the surveillance videos, the swimmers initially attempt to leave after they relieved themselves, but a man approaches and stops the cabbie. He appeared to have something in his hand as he briefly reached inside the cab. Deluz said he thought one of the guards did flash a badge when he ""first approached them."" Lochte is correct that the men, who were working a private security detail, are members of law enforcement. Veloso admitted during a Thursday news conference the men are state agents – it is common for Brazilian law enforcement to carry out private security on their off hours, though in some instances it is illegal. Veloso declined to identify the guards or give more details, saying they feared retaliation for their role in the incident. Local news outlets that claim to have spoken with the security guards have identified them as prison guards from the neighboring state of Minas Gerais . Police have not accounted for why the guards allegedly showed their law enforcement badges while they were working private security. But Veloso defended the guards drawing their weapons. ""Right now we have the testimony of the security guards about the extreme action of four young men with strong physiques and an attitude that is, at least, inappropriate,"" Veloso said. Video also supports Lochte’s contention that one of the guards prevented the cabbie from driving off. What happened next could be attributed to cultural and linguistic clumsiness or to the swimmers allegedly being inebriated. ""Two men, whom I believe to have been security guards, then instructed us to exit the vehicle. No guns were drawn during this exchange, but we did see a gun tucked into one of the guard's waistband,"" Bentz said. ""As Jimmy (Feigen) and Jack (Conger) were walking away from the vehicle, the first security guard held up a badge to me and drew his handgun. I yelled to them to come back toward us, and they complied. Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk."" Bystander Deluz described the drawing of the weapons by the two guards as a reaction to the athletes' attempt to leave the scene. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY When approached on Tuesday by a USA TODAY Sports reporter who asked to see witness testimony related to the incident, the Rio de Janeiro civil police declined to give any information, saying the investigation was confidential. By Thursday, after police had pulled Bentz and Conger off their U.S.-bound flight and detained them for questioning, police welcomed dozens of camera crews that squeezed into the station to film the men as they were escorted by cops into the office. Immediately after their interviews, police called a news conference – in a nearby theater – to announce the official version of events. Shortly afterward the police released their reports of testimony given by Conger and Bentz that included statements casting doubt on Lochte's version of events. However, that testimony was missing a portion of the men's story – their interactions with armed security guards. Rio's civil police declined to provide the testimony in its entirety when requested by USA TODAY Sports. By late Friday, even the partial testimony had been removed from the police's social media site. Police accused Lochte and Feigen of filing a false police report, a crime punishable by a fine and up to six months in prison. Feigen paid $11,000 to be donated to a charity in order to not face charges. Deborah Srour, an attorney who has practiced in Brazil for 25 years, said the two swimmers’ actions do not constitute a crime based on a strict reading of the Brazilian penal code. ""This crime only happens when you go to the police and you make a report, you file a report,’’ said Srour, who added that she has represented Americans arrested in Brazil. ""This did not happen.’’ She said any case against Lochte could very well be dismissed with the help of a local attorney. But she also said Brazilian courts are notorious for pursuing cases such as Lochte’s if charges are filed and that authorities could use Interpol and other international organizations to complicate his overseas travel. ""I’m not saying his travel is going to be hindered right now or anything,’’ she said. ""But it’s just going to be a nuisance for him. So he should just apologize and pay the fine and that’s it.’’","he thought the swimmers were being robbed when they were approached at a gas station by armed men who flashed badges, pointed guns at them and demanded money."
2179," Finding yourself being asked for a lot of free advice? This could be a signal that you're ready to make the move to being a paid consultant. Anchoring first and firmly with your rate can be a way to make that happen. It happened again - you delivered a great presentation or you networked like crazy at a conference and the emails and texts start to roll in. The questions might be variations of the same script, but it inevitably will end with this question: Can I pick your brain for free? There is a lot of good advice on how to handle these requests, but it is still a popular question I get and a situation I struggled with for a long time. Moreover, the research is clear: women do risk negative backlash when they ask for more money. So what do you do when you want to help people, but you are not comfortable with making the money ask? The answer might be to practice anchoring first. Anchoring in negotiation is the first offer made on a deal. In this case, that first offer is your fee or rate in exchange for time with your expertise. When someone asks for your help, consider responding with this advice from Tammy Gordon, President of Verified Strategy: Practice saying, I'd love to. My rate is $____ an hour. What day works for you? That's the hardest part. Uttering those words feels really foreign a first. But, if you're going to be a consultant, those words are your livelihood. Then anchor first and firmly with your rate, and be aware that your anchor might shut down the request. But the potential for the conversation to end shouldn't keep you from anchoring. Remember that charging for your time is a reflection of how you value your knowledge, skills and abilities. It's also important to consider charging for your time when: You have highly specialized knowledge and expertise. You are helping someone solve a problem that you have no connection to. You do not gain any direct or indirect benefit from helping solving the problem. Anchoring first should not be the end of the negotiation, and the negotiation might go any number of ways depending on who you are talking to. If you want to work with people asking for your help and they indicate that they cannot pay your rate, let them know you can move on price if you are able to do so. You could offer them a custom rate, and have a conversation around what that lower rate might be. If you do not want to work with them or do not have the capacity to collaborate at the moment, diplomatically let them know you cannot move on price. If it is a relationship you value, consider having a pre-prepared free or more affordable option that is easy for you to give. You can also refer the person to someone else that could help. But what if the person asking for help is a friend? How do you manage that important relationship? Remember that you are donating your time if you do not charge them a fee, even when it is a friend. Offer other options to recognize your value, like writing a public testimonial for you on a site like LinkedIn or promoting your latest work on social media. Have a conversation with them and generate ideas that will help them get the advice they need and while also helping you advance your interests. Time is the ultimate scarce resource. Whether paid or donated, there are tradeoffs associated with how you spend your time, including spending that same time doing business development and other revenue generating work. While the first few anchors you drop might be awkward, there is an upside to charging people for your time. It's not just about a fee. People paying for your help is an investment in themselves to make a change or solve a problem faster. If you come out of the nonprofit, philanthropy or social impact space, this can be a difficult mental pivot to make. I have given out thousands of hours of free advice, sometimes to people who did not have resources and needed advice. Over time, I noticed that they would not follow through with changes in the same way that paying clients would. The downside to anchoring with a rate is you might get less requests for help, which may not be a downside. Less requests means more time for you to build your business and reclaim your time.",make the move to being a paid consultant
2180,"The government is focusing its efforts on improving the public transportation system and changing citizens’ driving habits MANILA, Philippines – To solve Metro Manila’s traffic crisis – dubbed the worst on earth by navigation app Waze – the government is focusing its efforts on improving the public transportation system and changing citizens’ driving habits. Though the government has been hard at work to improve public transport around Manila, people need to start following traffic rules and regulations for any significant improvement to occur, Transportation Undersecretary Annelie Lontoc said in an interview on Monday, July 18. For starters, a more streamlined enforcement system is being tested on EDSA, Lontoc said. The government has divided the busy thoroughfare into 10 traffic zones, each with its own dedicated personnel from the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to enforce traffic rules. Each of these zones will also have access to tow trucks, a quick response team on motorcycles, and personnel from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to help with illegally parked cars and ""colorum"" (out-of-line) vehicles. Despite all the government’s efforts, however, Lontoc insisted that peoples’ driving habits need to change before the traffic situation can improve. According to Lontoc, since the MMDA re-implemented the No Contact Apprehension Policy in April, more than 25,000 vehicles have been apprehended. ""We really need discipline,"" said Lontoc when asked about driving habits. ""We can’t just rely on enforcement. Car users need to follow the rules themselves. The roads are already so congested that anything that can stop traffic – like stalled vehicles – will cause it to accumulate."" Overall, however, Lontoc believes that the traffic crisis can be resolved. ""If we maintain our lane, if we are defensive drivers, we can avoid it,"" she said, referring to congestion in the streets. ""As long as the road is moving, the cooperation of everyone to make the traffic flow is really a big deal,"" she added. Improvements coming to public transportation In relation to Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella’s statement that traffic in Metro Manila would improve within the next 100 days, Lontoc also said that, ""Within 100 days, we will restore the MRT and LRT to 2010 level, where there are 20 trains running."" Regarding long-term plans for the train systems, Lontoc stated that the main goal was to increase the passenger capacity of these trains. Today, the train lines are only able to serve 350,000 passengers each day—a mere 3% of the over 12 million commutes made throughout Metro Manila daily. Over the next 3 years, Department of Transportation will work to procure more coaches, build extensions for LRT 1, LRT 2, and MRT 7, and invest heavily on infrastructure so as to serve a larger number of commuters across a wider range of areas. The Department is also in the process of deploying of cheap, safe, and well-maintained point-to-point buses, said Lontoc. The government hopes that by making these buses more comfortable and convenient – taking commuters from one location to another without any stops in between – more people will opt for public transport, reducing the number of cars on the road. Currently 25% of the people who take these buses have already made the shift from taking private vehicles, but the government intends to get that figure up to 50%.

2205,"Is it safe for pregnant women to go swimming in a public pool? I was told by my doctor that I shouldn't go swimming in the indoor pool at my gym because pregnant women have compromised immunity and the pool will have high levels of bacteria. I am unable to find any research supporting this, however, and would like to use the gym pool to exercise while pregnant. Dr. Catherine Spong, a practicing obstetrician-gynecologist and acting director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, says a woman’s immune system is considered more vulnerable when she is pregnant. But as long as the pool water is well maintained, evidence favors taking a dip. A 2010 study conducted in Denmark and published in the journal Epidemiology aimed to answer the question ""Is Swimming During Pregnancy a Safe Exercise? by comparing swimming, bicycling and no exercise. Swimming is considered an ideal activity for pregnant women, the study found. There was no indication that swimming in pool water ""is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes."" A more recent study, published in 2013 in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, cited concerns that either water-borne pathogens or methods of disinfecting pool water might increase the risk of birth defects. But the data found no positive association between pool use and birth defects, which the authors called ""reassuring."" Most recently, a report issued in December from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists presented swimming as a safe physical activity for pregnant women. In its review of physical activity and exercise, the report listed safe and unsafe physical activities for pregnant women reflecting new clinical and scientific data.

2210,"There are ways to save money on your pills Nurofen, Calpol, Boots hayfever tablets – what a racket! The pharmaceutical industry is full of genuine wizards. Both those who make the drugs, and the marketeers who use a raft of tricks to persuade us there’s hidden magic in their brands so we should pay more. A few weeks ago Advertising Standards ruled Nurofen’s TV ad misled people by promoting piffle that its Joint and Back Pain product specifically targeted those areas. I’ve been ranting about the cost of branded pharmaceuticals for years and on the back of this ruling my site, with help from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, did some telling research. Name game It’s the name you’re paying for – Nurofen’s overpriced by 692 per cent. It’s a medicine’s ""active"" ingredient that does the business. So look on the pack to see what that is, then just buy the same generic version for less. Getty Is one tablet really better than another for back pain The only other thing that really counts is whether it’s a tablet or a liquid capsule (as they deliver it quicker). The only exception is if you have certain allergies, when different tablets have different ingredients. We compared 15 branded products at their cheapest against the cheapest generic. Nurofen was worst at £1.98 compared to its 25p generic ibuprofen equivalent. Calpol, Anadin and Clarityn were up there too. Yet psychology is powerful, as Pam Facebooked me: ""When I worked in ­pharmacy I steered customers to non-branded items, as they’re EXACTLY the same but a fraction of the price. Some still bought the brand as ""it works better for them"". Same problem In some cases the tablets aren’t similar but IDENTICAL, with huge price differences. Check the product number on the pack side. If it’s the same, the tablets are identical. Both the Boots and Galpharm hayfever tablets pictured left are PL16028/0080 on both packs. Getty Make sure you check the label on the pills Yet there’s a £5.20 price difference. While supermarket own brands are pretty reasonable, Boots and Lloyds pharmacies can be costly, so check for cheaper generics. Different packets You can have the same product from the same firm, but different packaging. By checking the product code you see Anadin Ultra and Anadin Period Pain are the same. Big brands often change the packaging so we think it’s a special product. And it’s not just Anadin – Sudafed and others do it too. It’s clever – when you’re hurting, you might think ""there must be a reason for saying it’s good for back pain"" and not look for cheaper options. Don’t be fooled. Do you know what? Getting that out of my system seems to have cured my headache...","look on the pack to see what that is, then just buy the same generic version for less"

2216,"On Wednesday, crowds gathered in stands under a harsh sun to watch Hyperloop One propel a piece of metal down a track and into some sand at 120 mph. If this sounds a bit lackluster to you, your gut instinct would be correct: This was not a mind-blowing experience. The Hyperloop is a transportation concept first popularized by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wherein pods are jetted at over 700 mph inside a tube system. Hyperloop One is one of two companies building this futuristic system. The other, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, is working on building a test site in California's Quay Valley. The demonstration was just a small taste before the main event in December, when the company will reveal its technology in full. The propulsion test is a major first step in proving that this technology can be developed quickly and effectively. While the fanfare was certainly meant to excite the masses, the event seemed more like a waving of the flag for regulatory authorities, as if to say: Get ready, we're coming. Approving new transportation technology — especially one that will eventually ferry humans — is an arduous task that could serve as more of an impediment to the Hyperloop than building the technology itself. Hyperloop One is moving fast, but are we ready for it? The technology promises to shuttle cargo and people at 700 mph in an electricity-fueled system that has zero emissions. While the concept seems far-fetched, as Wednesday's event demonstrated, the actual technology could be right around the corner. The scene of the Hyperloop One test Source: Ruth Reader ""This stuff didn't exist!"" Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd said enthusiastically in an interview. The company only set up shop in Las Vegas five months ago, and already its propulsion test is complete. If Hyperloop One is able to have its ""Kitty Hawk moment"" before the end of the year, legislators are going to have to contend with making these pod-shuttling tubes legal. In March 2017, Lloyd says that his company plans to start selecting the best routes and projects from Hyperloop One's global competition and begin building. While the Hyperloop has lots of positive potential, it's still unclear whether it's actually something that the world needs and can afford. We already have a lot of transportation infrastructure. Many of the places that could potentially afford a Hyperloop are fairly well-developed. Europe has an extensive rail network. Japan is know for its system of magnetic levitation trains. The United States is full of both freight-carrying and human-ferrying railways. Where will we put a Hyperloop? Lloyd acknowledges that there is a lot of existing infrastructure. ""The world is full already and our cities are jammed. So there are almost no alternatives; you can't build more roads in San Francisco, you try to improve them. We create these HOV lanes; they solve one problem, create another,"" he said. But he thinks that a Hyperloop will help alleviate problems for an already over-worn system. ""So the beauty of what we can do here is we can reuse existing right of way. We can jump on top of or go beside a rail line. We can sit inside the safety area of a highway,"" he said. ""We can go in the LA river. We can go underground and completely bypass the surface, because our cost of tunneling is exponentially lower."" Fighting for funds. One of the main arguments for building a Hyperloop is that it will be cheaper to build than a new bullet train, which at current estimates is going to cost $64 billion. Though Elon Musk estimated it to be roughly $6 billion in a white paper explaining the Hyperloop, there isn't currently an available cost analysis for what a Hyperloop would actually cost. Of course, once we know how much it will cost, we'll have to answer the question of whether we want to pay for it. As mentioned earlier, the world already has a lot of systems in place that need money too. On Friday, the American Society of Civil Engineers noted the U.S. is underspending on current infrastructure, estimating it should be spending $3.32 trillion ($1.44 trillion more than current spending forecasts allot) to keep things in order. Private organizations and governments are constantly debating whether to pay for a new system or upgrade an old one. With funding limited, it's not impossible that they'll decide it's easier to keep doing what we've been doing. To that, Lloyd says: ""We're going to go where the regulators want to see us there and where they want to work quickly to create the environment so we can go to production. And where they don't want to do that we'll go somewhere else.""",there isn't currently an available cost analysis for what a Hyperloop would actually cost
2218,"If you live in Texas, as well as a number of other states, you have certainly seen a fence post or tree painted purple. And you probably already know not to go anywhere near it. But do you understand why? Texas and other states with the purple paint law allow residents and land owners to mark the outskirts of their territory with bright purple spray paint. Instead of building a wall or fence around the property, Texans and residents of other states with a similar law understand that purple paint means no trespassing... Why do states do this? Well because of the unpredictable weather patterns, especially considering the disastrous effect climate change is having on America’s southern states, ""No Trespassing"" signs can easily be blown away in a wind storm. Landowners need another way to mark the borders of their land. And as any Texan understands, if someone has a sprawling patch of land, how are they supposed to monitor their property’s boarders if they have to do so much on a daily basis? It’s just too much work for anyone to do on top of farming their land or managing their cattle. Because the landowners in Texas and other states with the purple paint law have so much land to watch over, they probably wouldn’t notice a single ""No Trespassing"" sign missing in the first place. It’s not like they go around checking on that every day. The purple paint law allows landowners to spray it and forget it. Besides telling any passerby that the land beyond belongs to someone, the purple mark is also known as ""No Hunting Purple."" It signifies to hunters that this property belongs to an individual and to stay clear. It can help keep people out of their properties and keep people safe from stray bullets. The Purple paint law is not new. Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was born, first created this law back in 1987. So if you’ve accidentally wandered beyond a purple painted fence or gate, you’ve broken the law. At least now you know what it really means. A number of states utilize the Purple Paint Law in order to signify ""No Trespassing."" Here is the list: -Texas -Illinois -Missouri -North Carolina -Maine -Florida -Idaho -Arkansas -Montana -Arizona -Kansas Does your state have the Purple Paint Law? Do you think it is a good law to institute in every state? According to Central Texas Geocachers, Purple paint markings in Texas ""must be: vertical, at least 8 inches long, at least 1 inch wide. [The] bottom of the mark should be between 3-5 feet above the ground. Markings can be no more than 100 feet apart in timberland. Markings can be no more than 1,000 feet apart on open land, [and] they must be in a place visible by those approaching the property."" Have you heard about the purple paint law before?

2221,"Whenever you go for a walk in the park, you see dog walkers being dragged in all directions by their charges. Sometimes you come across something huge like a Great Dane leading the charge, but as often as not it is a diminutive terrier barking the orders. Perhaps you have also seen funny videos of giant, docile mutts running in fear from pernicious pups. We asked our readers if they thought smaller breeds of dog were more aggressive than their larger cousins. Priyanka Habib got straight to the point. ""The tinier they are, the louder and crazier they are!"" The team found that the smaller males ""attacked sooner and with greater intensity"" than the larger ones Alan Clark offered an explanation: ""I think a lot of small dogs suffer from small dog syndrome. My teacup Yorkie is terrible for confronting big dogs."" It is easy to imagine why ""small dog syndrome"" might arise. As Travis Souders put it: ""They're not necessarily mean, but they're certainly more commonly defensive. How would you feel if you were so tiny?"" Small dog syndrome has a human counterpart in the ""Napoleon complex"", when someone of diminutive stature compensates by being domineering towards others. This may make intuitive sense, but research suggests this phenomenon is anecdotal at best. David Sandberg of The University of Buffalo in New York and Linda Voss of the Peninsula Medical School in Plymouth, UK reviewed the evidence for a Napoleon complex in a study published in 2002. They concluded that ""the psychological adaptation of individuals who are shorter than average is largely indistinguishable from others, whether in childhood, adolescence or adulthood."" We see this in nature all the time. Finches and sparrows harassing crows and eagles. Cougars fending off bears. It's not uncommon. Still, what holds true for humans may not necessarily be the case for animals. In a study published in 2012, researchers lead by P. Andreas Svensson of Linnaeus University in Sweden tracked the behaviour of fish called desert gobies. Male desert gobies defend nests, so the researchers introduced ""intruder"" males that the ""resident"" males had to see off. The team found that the smaller males ""attacked sooner and with greater intensity"" than the larger ones. So if small desert gobies can behave more aggressively than larger ones, could the same be true of dogs? There is a bit of a leap from a fish to a dog, but as Paul Durnion says: ""We see this in nature all the time. Finches and sparrows harassing crows and eagles. Cougars fending off bears. It's not uncommon."" Chunyang Li suggests: ""Smaller dogs maybe feel scared about bigger ones, so they always try to protect themselves first of all, showing meaner behaviour."" The problem with small dogs comes from the owners passing on their anxieties to the dogs themselves In a 2013 paper, Paul McGreevy of the University of Sydney in Australia and his team set out to explore whether dogs' outward characteristics are related to their behaviour. Dogs were a good species in which to study this, McGreevy wrote, ""because skull shapes and body shape are so diverse among breeds"". His team tried to find out if dogs that had similar physical traits also behaved similarly. They found that shorter dogs had higher levels of ""owner-directed aggression, begging for food, urine marking and attachment/attention-seeking"". In other words, based on this one study smaller dogs really are more aggressive, at least in certain circumstances. However, the data tells us nothing about why this is. The researchers concluded that it was ""impossible to determine from these data the extent to which the observed relationships are genetically or environmentally determined."" Size might have an influence but it doesn't mean every little dog is vicious It is certainly possible that smaller dogs have an inbuilt tendency towards aggression, but there are plenty of other potential explanations – most of which have to do with the way humans treat dogs. ""The problem with small dogs comes from the owners passing on their anxieties to the dogs themselves,"" says Emmet Folens. ""They think that as they're small they are prone to be injured by big dogs and generally don't let them socialise as pups."" Alternatively, Hayley Bayles thinks that ""owners of small dogs tend to feed their dogs the behaviour by treating them like babies and not actual dogs."" Are they barking up the wrong tree or are they hot on the scent? McGreevy's study only showed a correlation between size and aggression, not an absolute link, says canine behavioural expert Daniel Mills of Lincoln University in the UK. ""Size might have an influence but it doesn't mean every little dog is vicious,"" he says. We also do not have good information on which breeds of dog attack the most. ""The literature on dog bites suggests you're more likely to report a bite from a German Shepherd than a Jack Russell, because it's a more severe injury,"" says Mills. ""So there's enormous unreliability in [the] available data."" When interacting with little dogs, we may be less aware of early signals of aggression like staring I wondered if humans might be at fault for, perhaps unwittingly, coercing certain behaviours out of small dogs. Mills says there may be something to that. ""People think about these handbag dogs as commodities,"" he says. ""They're as much a status symbol as pit bulls. They're not happy being carried around in handbags and it affects their behavioural development."" In fact there are many ways we can affect canine behaviour. ""You often get self-fulfilling prophecies,"" says Mills. ""If a certain behaviour is expected in a dog, it may become tolerated."" We can also be a bit oblivious. ""When interacting with little dogs, we may be less aware of early signals of aggression like staring, whereas if a big dog stares and goes still, we think 'I'm not going to approach',"" says Mills. ""So the first level of what we see in small dogs is something like a snarl, which makes us think they're more aggressive than the bigger dog. [In fact] they're both just saying 'keep away'."" The truth, it seems, is a bit fiddly. There is evidence that smaller dogs tend to be a bit more high-strung than larger dogs, but it may be people that create this difference in behaviour: either by raising small dogs differently, or by misinterpreting their actions. Maybe keep that in mind the next time you play with a Pomeranian.","Alan Clark offered an explanation: ""I think a lot of small dogs suffer from small dog syndrome.

2222,"Here’s Why Jet Black iPhone 7 Is Facing Worldwide Shortage Oliver Haslam Apple’s recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in a whole new color this time around, with the Jet Black offerings proving popular amongst those who have managed to get their hands on one. Unfortunately, managing to do that has been hard work, with the manufacturing process required in order to create that Jet Black chassis said to be causing problems for Apple and its suppliers. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, as many as 40% of the Jet Black iPhones that are currently being made are failing to pass Apple’s quality checking process, which then requires them to be remade. This considerable rejection rate is believed to be behind a worldwide shortage of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets in that particular finish, with shipping estimates for Jet Black iPhones almost immediately stretching out into October and beyond once iPhones were available for pre-order. As Kuo notes, though, normal iPhone demand may not be the only reason for such stock delays, with Samsung’s recent Galaxy Note 7 recall potentially part of the reason demand has been so high. Early shortage not entirely due to market demand. Shipment time for online orders is on par with last year’s cycle, generally estimated within 2-3 weeks, with the exception of the jet black model, which suffers from a low casing production yield rate of 60-70%. However, with the number of countries in the first wave to debut the iPhone 7 rising to 28 this year, versus 12 for the iPhone 6S launch, we believe overall demand for iPhone 7 is lower than that of its predecessor. Regarding news of some mobile operators reporting pre-order growth for the iPhone 7 over last year’s 6S, we believe this is mainly attributable to market share gains for these mobile operators thanks to new promotions, rather than representing greater consumer demand. Kuo still believes that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will fail to match sales figures set by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus last year, perhaps in the belief that next year’s iPhone will prove to be the big seller given expectations that it will be a complete redesign in honor of the iPhone’s tenth birthday.

2230,"Though it’s commonly believed that women fake orgasms to make their partners feel better about their sexual prowess, a new study presented at the British Psychological Society’s Psychology of Women annual conference reveals otherwise. Researchers Emily Thomas, Monika Stelzl, and Michelle Lafrance gathered 15 women (whose ages ranged from 19 to 28 years old) together to talk about faking orgasms. These volunteers each had been sexually active for at least one year at the time they were interviewed. During these interviews, the women were asked to talk about consensual sex – yet all 15 women ended up mentioning unenjoyable sexual experiences. ""While some women spoke about faking orgasm in positive ways, for instance, as a pleasurable experience that heightened their own arousal, many talked about feigning pleasure in the context of unwanted and unpleasurable sexual experiences,"" Thomas revealed. ""Within these accounts, we were struck by the degree to which women were connecting the practice of faking orgasm to accounts of unwanted sex."" In other words: Some women are faking their orgasms so their partner will orgasm faster and so sex will be over sooner. To further analyze this unfortunate trend, researchers observed how these women discuss such sexual experiences when it comes to faking their orgasms. What the study’s authors found was that – though these incidents could be seen as rape or coercion – these women never referred to them as such. In fact, they were much more casual and ended up simply referring to their experiences as ""bad.""",so sex will be over sooner

2234,"Pregnancy, as exciting as it can be, comes with some pretty nasty side effects: nausea, vomiting, anxiety over the life of your unborn child, and sleepless nights due to, well, all of the above and more (think aches and pains basically everywhere). Sounds like something a hit off a joint could fix in a minute, right?  Maybe... but is smoking weed while you’re pregnant really a smart idea? More women than ever seem to think so: A 2019 study found that a growing number of pregnant women are using marijuana recreationally. Do the risks outweigh the benefits? Here’s what to know before you puff away.  Smoking cigarettes while pregnant is a huge no-no. But what about weed? In short: Doctors do not recommend smoking weed while you’re pregnant. Still, many believe the drug is not as unsafe during pregnancy as it seems, while others believe edibles aren’t as harmful as, say, taking a hit of a joint. Basically, there are arguments for the use of weed during pregnancy, but healthcare professionals say it’s a hard pass.  Don’t laugh, but... what is weed, anyway? You might hear some people argue that weed is safe during pregnancy because it’s a natural plant. And that part is true: Marijuana (also known by many nicknames, including weed, pot, and bud) is the dried portion of the Cannabis sativa plant.  Still, just because it’s natural doesn’t make it safe. People smoke weed because it makes them feel good. The drug can leave you feeling euphoric and relaxed while enhancing your senses. These mind-altering effects are due to delta-0-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  Marijuana can be smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (aka joints), pipes, bongs, or blunts. You don’t even have to smoke it: You can drink marijuana in tea or bake it into foods like brownies, cookies, or candies (which are called edibles). The bottom line: All that THC might reach the fetus According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the chemicals in marijuana might be able to reach the fetus by crossing the placenta — which is exactly what you don’t want.  There’s limited research on exactly what weed can do to a fetus (pregnant women aren’t exactly jumping at the chance to be test subjects). Still, doctors know of some possible risks, and that’s why they advise against it. OK, but this morning sickness has to go. Can’t weed help? Most pregnant women experience some nausea and vomiting while pregnant, whether it lasts only for the first trimester or throughout the pregnancy. Marijuana has been shown to be effective at fighting off nausea and vomiting, so it’s not shocking that some studies have said weed might be able to ease frustrating morning sickness.  A small 2006 study of 84 women found that 65 percent used marijuana to relieve morning sickness, and over 92 percent of those using marijuana rated it as ""extremely effective"" or ""effective."" But other studies have found that when women used marijuana during pregnancy, their children were more likely to develop problems with behavior, learning, and memory. Basically, some researchers believe smoking weed while pregnant can affect a baby’s brain.  So... yes or no? There’s no single study or piece of research that confirms marijuana use can relieve morning sickness. And even if it could, healthcare providers would still recommend against it — no exceptions. And yes, that includes medical marijuana.  What happens if you do smoke weed while you’re pregnant? Again, the research on marijuana use during pregnancy is limited, but doctors say it could have several negative effects on a developing baby, including: low birth weight, premature birth, small head circumference, small length, stillbirth, disruption in normal brain development, possible effects on memory and cognitive ability, possible effects on fetal heart rate, potential long-term behavioral problems Weed can affect your judgment or cause dizziness, which could lead to a fall or injury that could harm your developing fetus. In general, it isn’t worth the risk. What if you smoke after the baby is born? Once the baby is born and your body is yours again, you may assume it’s safe to pick the habit right back up again... but that might not be true.  Some experts consider THC to be a developmental neurotoxin, which means a child whose mother smoked might have trouble with memory, attention, controlling impulses, and school performance.  Secondhand marijuana smoke may also be just as damaging as secondhand smoke from cigarettes.  Marijuana can also affect your level of awareness, and you kinda need your full faculties when you’re the primary caregiver for a tiny newborn.  Pay close attention if you’re breastfeeding  More research needs to be done on the effects of marijuana when a mother is breastfeeding. Due to the lack of research, doctors generally don’t recommend using marijuana while breastfeeding. Some studies have found it’s possible for a small amount of THC to be present in breast milk. This could affect an infant’s nervous system development or even slow their motor development.  Other research has found that exposure to marijuana through breast milk can cause babies to have a decreased sucking reflex, spend less time feeding, and therefore be slow to gain weight and develop physically.","used marijuana during pregnancy, their children were more likely to develop problems with behavior, learning, and memory."

In the video of the incident, some members of the border staff can be seen temporarily abandoning their posts, as cars crossing the border between the U.S. and Mexico stop to view the lights and honk their horns.

2243,"Ahhh, the elusive six pack. For many, it's the holy grail of fitness. But does your life really change after you've achieved one? Let's take a look at the ways that getting a six pack changes your life and when it's really just fool's gold. First, let's briefly talk about how to obtain a six pack. Generally speaking, you have to reach a level of leanness where your midsection is lean enough to show the abdominal muscles underneath. This level varies, but a good rule of thumb is under 10% bodyfat for men and 20% for women. This is much easier said than done and it's akin to saying ""just eat less, move more ."" Depending on where you start from, this bodyfat could be far below your body's ""set point,"" the amount of fat that your body naturally settles on. Dipping too far below your set point, especially through aggressive dieting , is like rollerblading up a slippery hill. You'll have to fight your body's physiology tooth and nail. Still, obtaining a six pack is possible, even if it's difficult. I've seen many obsess over this quest, believing that it will ultimately change their life. I definitely thought this the first time I achieved one. But difficulty aside, will it? No One Will Treat You Differently Because Of It There's a perception that people with six packs are treated differently. This is why many people, guys in particular, begin their fitness journey—to look good and attract someone. It may help, but not as much as you think. No one actually knows that you're sporting abs under your clothing. In fact, unless you reach an advanced level of muscularity, the low levels of bodyfat that are required may leave you looking less athletic when wearing clothes. When I first got lean enough for a six pack, I thought that everyone would view me differently. In reality, this wasn't the case: women didn't come flocking to me, guys didn't look at me with envy, and the only extra attention I received was for my neurotic dieting behaviors that were required to keep my abs. Sponsored From an attraction standpoint, you'll probably benefit from getting leaner, but there is little additional benefit between being ""lean enough"" and being in six pack territory. It's not that no one notices; it's that no one cares. You'll Realize Your Own Capabilities Achieving a six pack is one of the most common fitness physique milestones. When you hit one of these milestones, something amazing happens: you realize that you have the capability to take all aspects of your life into your own hands. I've met a lot of people who reached their fitness goals, and then went on to master other things, such as their finances, their career, and so on. There's a lot of self-doubt that runs through your mind throughout the process of getting lean. You'll start to doubt your genetic capabilities, your fortitude, and pretty much every single quality around your self-esteem. When you finally achieve that goal, you develop a strong growth mentality around everything in life. You realize that self-doubt is in your head and changing yourself is completely within your control. It also becomes evident that fitness, just like everything else , is a skill. If there's anything about getting a six pack that attracts members of the opposite sex, it's the confidence from this new mindset. The Biggest Benefit of All But here's the biggest benefit of all, especially for those who have been chasing this goal for ages. As explained by coach and nutritionist Martin Berkhan, the creator of Leangains: The secret benefit of being lean is that it's an immense time saver. Be honest with yourself: if you're on a diet, you spend a fair amount of time thinking about it. Being perfectly content saves up an astounding amount of mental energy. Gone are the worries, doubts and obsessions about diet, weight and all other issues pertaining to reaching your goal. The itch is gone. No need to scratch it anymore. But that void needs to be filled with something. You will suddenly rediscover new interests and hobbies - I did. Don't fill the void with more training. Fill it with reading, family, friends or whatever you like. Learn to be content once your ultimate goal is reached. Set new goals, but learn to accept slower, gradual progress. This doesn't necessarily apply to everyone. Many people are perfectly content with never achieving the required levels of leanness. But if this has been one of your lifelong goals, maintaining a six pack allows you to put the obsession to rest. Fitness becomes less of a priority and more something you just ""do."" And that, ironically, is the best way to incorporate fitness into your life.",you develop a strong growth mentality around everything in life
2244,"(CNN) We have all had the experience of being gagged by the ""like"" button on Facebook. As we scroll through our news feed, we sometimes come across stories that trigger loathing, sadness or even rage. But all we have is a like button. Sure, we can write a long message in the comment field. But there is no button to instantly express negative emotions. That is about to change. Facebook has announced it will create a ""dislike button."" Only last year, Mark Zuckerberg said, ""Some people have asked for a dislike button because they want to be able to say 'that thing isn't good,' and we're not going to do that ... I don't think that's socially very valuable, or great for the community."" Now, Zuckerberg has admitted that ""not every moment is good"" and perhaps a dislike button isn't such a bad idea after all. It seems that we have been become so fragile that any sign of negativity -- even a simple thumbs down on a social media website -- is something that must be avoided at all costs. All we want is a constant stream of thumbs up. The slightest sign someone might disagree with us is enough to send us into an emotional tailspin. Zuckerberg may have changed his mind, but many other people have not. Some think the dislike button will toxify relationships. Others fear it will fuel bullying and other kinds of aggressive behavior online . But the biggest worry is the button will "" actively foster negativity ."" It seems we have become so fragile that any sign of negativity -- even a simple thumbs down on a social media website -- is something that must be avoided at all costs. All we want is a constant stream of thumbs up. The slightest sign someone might disagree with us is enough to send us into an emotional tailspin. One of the most insidious ideas of our time is positive thinking. It's drilled into many of us: think positive, don't think negative. It's no wonder people find the prospect of the dislike button so worrisome. People are constantly told to be upbeat, even in the face of horrible situations. Sick people are told to stay positive and think about their illness as a ""gift."" The unemployed are advised to ban all negative words (like ""unemployed"") and even stop reading the news (too much negativity there). When an entrepreneur fails, he is told to see it as ""step forward."" And of course we can only ""like"" things on Facebook. Being positive certainly comes with benefits. But research is starting to reveal that all this upbeat thinking has some big downsides . When we are unable to express negative feelings, many human emotions become off limits. We avoid taking a realistic look at problems, which means we overlook risks and do stupid things. Those who don't feel on top of the world start to think there is something seriously wrong with them. Those in an upbeat mood tend to be more selfish and feel more socially disconnected. What is even more surprising is that people told to think positively often end up feeling worse. As we start to recognize the limits of always looking on the bright side, negative thinking is making a comeback. It's not just Facebook that will allow you to dislike things. Some companies have started to support their employees in pointing out problems. One particularly interesting method that firms are using to avoid the mistakes made by our bias toward positive thinking is the "" pre-mortem ."" It works like this: When we begin a project we largely focus on the bright side. As a result, we think the project will take half as long and cost half as much as it actually does. By doing a pre-mortem, we try to think as negatively as possible and identify anything that might go wrong. When people engage in this kind of negative thinking, they tend to spot flaws and fix them before they become a problem. Maybe, if used well, the ""dislike"" button could become a kind of early warning system in our own lives. It will allow us to see where we are going wrong, think a little more realistically, and avoid being blinded by our own optimism. Living with the thumbs down will be tough. We may get upset, be disturbed and sometimes feel gloomy. Excessive negativity can easily become bullying. But having a space to share our negative feelings every now and then can help us own up to the many problems that we face, and hopefully, deal with them in a levelheaded way.","Maybe, if used well, the ""dislike"" button could become a kind of early warning system in our own lives"

If a peanut butter craving hits, but raw peanuts aren't going to cut it, Brooking suggests spooning out a serving of peanut butter and then immediately placing the jar back into the cupboard. Eating straight from the jar is an absolute ""do not:"" It's difficult to gauge portion size and the concentration of spread makes it easy to mindlessly dig deeper. Go natural.

It read, in part: We’ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a fly-over by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush’s aloofness. Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good.

And, And, as has been documented ad nauseam , there's really no such thing as a vacation for a president of the United States.""Presidents don’t get vacations — they just get a change of scenery,"" Nancy Reagan famously told critics of her husband's regular trips to the family's ranch. Work, especially in this digital age, follows you around. Still, it's worth noting this moment. And that's because it speaks to Obama's unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on ""how it looks"" and/or ""how it will play."" Obama has long been a rejectionist on this front. His stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the Affordable Care Act badly hamstrung his party's attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law. His unwillingness to say the words ""radical Islamic terror"" have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And so on and so forth. Obama just doesn't like to fake it. If he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actually is stupid — he won't do it. Obama just doesn't like to fake it. If he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it — regardless of whether it actuallyisstupid — he won't do it. This riff in response to Republican criticism of how Obama describes the threat posed by the Islamic State militant group, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL, captures his view on perception politics nicely: For a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase ""radical Islam."" That’s the key, they tell us — we can’t beat ISIL unless we call them ""radical Islamists."" What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction... ...There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn’t use the label ""radical Islam."" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. Not once. So if someone seriously thinks that we don’t know who we're fighting, if there's anyone out there who thinks we're confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield. He's genuinely angry — not an emotion you see all that much from any politician at that level but particularly the usually calm and professorial Obama. And he's angry because in Obama's mind the sort of performance-for-the-sake-of-performance that Republicans are demanding is everything that's wrong with politics.

2255,"An insurance company posted a video on YouTube that had people as far away as Australia crying ""happy tears."" The video told the story of Joe and Beverly Smith’s special relationship with a classic vehicle. When high school sweethearts Joe and Beverly got married, they were just 19 years old. As they drove away from the church in their 1948 Plymouth convertible, they looked forward to what the future would bring. For the Smiths, the future brought the threat of war. Joe ended up being drafted and going to fight on the Korean peninsula during the Korean War in the 1950s. When Joe came back, the Smiths started their lives. Joe and Beverly started a family and Joe eventually owned his own car dealership. When Joe and Beverly would talk about the past with their kids, one thing that always came up was the 1948 Plymouth convertible. Joe and Beverly had had to sell it when Joe went off to war, but it was still a source of happy memories. Realizing how much the car meant to them and with their 60th anniversary coming up, the Smith's son Joel decided that a 1948 Plymouth convertible would be the perfect gift. Joel scoured the Internet to see if anyone was selling one of the antique cars. He said he only found four for sale. The one he ended up purchasing belonged to an elderly man in Indiana. Joel arranged to have the car transported to upstate New York where the Smiths live. With the help of a few family friends, Joel was able to surprise his parents with the car.","Realizing how much the car meant to them and with their 60th anniversary coming up, the Smith's son Joel decided that a 1948 Plymouth convertible would be the perfect gift."
2256,"Twitter Earlier today we reported that Katy Perry was going to release a naked video and she just has – but there’s a catch, of course. Posting on Twitter, the singer uploaded a short clip of her encouraging everyone to vote no matter how they look at the polling station – whether it be looking like a ‘hunk in child’s briefs’ or ‘covered in slime’. Katy proceeds to say that you can even vote in the nip before tearing her clothes off and throwing them to the ground – but unfortunately for every hapless pervert that clicked on this article and has probably stopped reading by now, there’s a massive black box protecting her dignity. Shortly after posing nude, the star gets arrested by two cops who urge her to thoroughly read the constitution. Instagram Katy posted the two minute ‘naked’ video in an attempt to ‘change the world’ by persuading people to vote, hopefully for Hillary. In the run up to the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, Katy has been incredibly vocal about her support for Hillary over social media. Getty When she was asked what topics she was looking forward to hearing most about during last night’s first debate between Clinton and The Donald – she replied ‘national security, gun control, police reform, excess incarceration and woman’s rights’.

But because of this kid’s young age, his stopping in the middle of a game is more adorable than it is frustrating.

2258,"One of the biggest surprise announcements at Apple's iPhone event on Wednesday was the introduction of AirPods, Apple's totally wireless headphones. AirPods really do look beautiful and futuristic, but one of the first questions we had about these wireless headphones was about theft. What happens if someone steals your AirPods? What if you're on the subway and someone snatches one or both out of your ears and runs away? Does Apple have a way of preventing this kind of theft? The short answer, unfortunately, is no. Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you'll have to buy new ones, just like any other Apple product. There's no anti-theft measures in place to protect your shiny wireless earbuds. That said, if one of your two AirPods is lost or stolen, Apple says you'll be able to buy just one. (Apple didn't say how much it would cost to buy just one.) So there you have it. Until Apple creates some kind of Touch ID for your ears, you'll have very few security measures to ensure your AirPods don't get lost or stolen. So be careful with them — at $159, they're not cheap.","Apple says that if AirPods are lost or stolen, you'll have to buy new ones, just like any other Apple product."
2259,"Amazon, FX, ABC This article originally appeared in Vulture. Are we currently experiencing the best fall TV season in several years? Considering the reception that has greeted many of 2016’s new network, cable, and streaming series, it certainly feels that way, which is a little unusual. Typically, as we inch toward the beginning of October, professional and nonprofessional TV viewers are more likely to be criticizing network executives’ programming decisions and placing bets on how many heavily hyped fall shows will make it past Christmas, not drowning in more great comedies and dramas than they can handle. That’s not to say that bets about which fall show will be canceled first have stopped being placed. (For the record, my money is on Notorious, which got bad reviews and terrible ratings in its first week on the air.) But as a critic sifting through so many just-out-of-the-oven scripted episodes, I have, so far, seen a lot more that I liked, or even loved, than I hated. Is it because TV is, overall, better than it was two, three, or five years ago? Well, yes and no. The reason this fall TV season may feel like the strongest in a long, long time has as much to do with issues of numbers and timing as it does quality, though quality is certainly a factor as well. It’s well-established that we are binge-watching in a time of maximum binge opportunities, and the amount of programming crowding our DVRs in September (and, soon, October) speaks to that. According to Vox’s calculations, nearly 70 new series will compete for attention during 2016’s autumnal months, as opposed to nearly 50 last year. (That latter number is based on a count of the new series mentioned in Variety’s comprehensive 2015 fall TV schedule.) John Landgraf, the FX overseer whose attention to the ballooning quantity of television has made him the nation’s Peak TV tracker in chief, pointed out at this summer’s Television Critics Association press tour that 419 scripted series debuted in 2015, up from 389 in 2014. As of July of this year, 322 original scripted series had already arrived, suggesting that 2016 is well on track to hit yet another peak. When you have more shows overall, the odds in favor of quality increase, although in the past, that still hasn’t prevented a lot of what’s been produced during this glut—a glut that gets, um, gluttier during the overwhelming fall months—from being mediocre. But some differences in terms of timing also have helped to lift the sails of this particular fall season. Amazon—which, until two years ago, when it unveiled the first season of Transparent, had not been a major fall season player at all—teed up a new show for release every Friday in September. One of those was Season 3 of Transparent, which, though enthusiastically received, doesn’t count as a brand-new series. But Tig Notaro’s One Mississippi and Phoebe Waller Bridge’s Fleabag are new and have been widely praised by critics and audiences. (Woody Allen’s Crisis in Six Scenes comes out on the forthcoming final Friday in September and looks unlikely to bask in a similar glow.) FX has generally targeted the nonfall months as the time to roll out its best shows. (See: The Americans, Fargo, and The People v. O.J. Simpson, among others.) American Horror Story has been a cornerstone of its third- and early fourth-quarter offerings since 2011, but, even though each season tells a different story, it hasn’t qualified as a truly new show since ""Murder House."" Last fall, FX had The Bastard Executioner, which it swiftly canceled after a single season, but that was pretty much it. This year is different. Landgraf’s network got a tiny jump on the mid-September crush by pushing out two universally embraced comedies—Atlanta and Better Things—right after Labor Day, effectively kicking off the fall season on two very high notes. HBO is yet another network with a higher new-show profile this fall than it’s had in a few years. In 2013, its only nonreturning scripted series was Hello, Ladies, while in 2014 and 2015, its fresh scripted fare was reserved for winter, spring, and summer. This fall, however, HBO has already given us the cinematic short-story pleasure that is High Maintenance, while October brings the sci-fi tentpole-hopeful Westworld and a pair of half-hour dramedies that have already deserved the positive buzz around them: Divorce, starring Sarah Jessica Parker, and Issa Rae’s Insecure. Then, of course, there are the major networks, which are still providing awful yet reasonably well-rated fare—ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kevin Can Wait—but also a lot of legitimately good stuff. To gauge just how good, I did an admittedly nonscientific comparison of the new shows from September and October of 2014 and 2015 with the shows that, so far, have come out in the fall of 2016, using the ultimate metric of quality: Rotten Tomatoes. The critical aggregator’s list of the best shows of 2014—all of which were certified fresh, meaning they earned scores of 75 percent positive or higher, after receiving a critical mass of reviews—included eight that premiered during September or October of that year: Gotham, Black-ish, How to Get Away With Murder, Transparent, The Flash, The Affair, Jane the Virgin, and Marry Me. Of those, six aired on a major network. The Rotten Tomatoes fall TV scorecard from last year also included eight September/October shows with the certified fresh marker: Red Oaks, Quantico, Casual, The Last Kingdom, The Grinder, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Supergirl, and Ash vs. Evil Dead. (Some of the best shows of last fall, including Master of None, didn’t show up until November.) Of those, four aired on major networks. Now let’s look at this year. Obviously, we’re still early in the season, which means the assessments of these series are based, in many cases, on a small sampling of episodes. Also, some—like Netflix’s Easy, which has a 91 percent positive Rotten Tomatoes score—still haven’t been certified fresh because there aren’t enough reviews associated with them yet to earn that designation. That being said, there are 11 certified fresh new shows—Queen Sugar, Atlanta, Better Things, One Mississippi, Fleabag, High Maintenance, The Good Place, This Is Us, Designated Survivor, Speechless, and Pitch—and five of them are on network television. Again: This is only September. With more series rolling out in the pre-Halloween weeks as well as November (including Netflix’s highly anticipated Black Mirror and Gilmore Girls), that number seems likely to climb.",issues of numbers and timing as it does quality
2260,"1 day ago 2 Shares So many direwolves have died in Game of Thrones that I genuinely have no idea whose is still alive and whose is dead. It's time for me to recap. Oh, usual shit with spoilers by the way... Anyway, as you should remember, each of the Stark kids got given a direwolf when they found a litter by a dead mother wolf in the very first episode. Since then the direwolves have slowly but surely been killed off. Sansa's wolf, Lady, was beheaded by Ned Stark on the way to King's Landing. Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind, was shot by an arrow while caged at The Red Wedding. Rickon's wolf, Shaggydog, was killed by the Umbers when he was captured and presented to Ramsay Bolton. And of course who can forget Bran's direwolf Summer, killed by white walkers in the most pointless defence of his master we've ever seen. Also, RIP Hodor - forever a legend. So that leaves Arya's wolf Nymeria and Jon's Ghost left alive in the Seven Kingdoms. We haven't seen Nymeria since about season 1 and it is believed she is currently roaming around the north awaiting Arya's return, which, as we now know, is impending. And Ghost? Well, Ghost has made sporadic appearances alongside Jon since his return from the dead. Given how much he loves ripping people's throats out, you'd imagine he'd have been right at home in the Battle of the Bastards, but fans have been wondering, where the fuck was he? Let's just get it straight from the start, Ghost is not dead. He's perfectly fine but producers basically couldn't afford to have him in the battle. Ghost isn't played by a live animal and is a CGI character, which means he's expensive to include in scenes and takes a lot of time and production work to include. Miguel Sapochnik, the man who directed the Battle of the Bastards, told Business Insider: ""[Ghost] was in there in spades originally, but it's an incredibly time consuming and expensive character to bring to life. ""Ultimately we had to choose between Wun-Wun and the direwolf, so the dog bit the dust."" Do you reckon that's why they killed Wun-Wun? To save money? Because if that's the case, that's even more treacherous than anything that's happened in Game of Thrones so far. Unreal. Battle of the Bastards already cost a shitload to produce according to Entertainment Weekly, and that's before you include the CGI budget. Apparently the battle scene itself took 25 days to film and needed 600 crew members, 500 extras, 70 horses and 25 stunt people. Overall, the cost was estimated between $11 million and $25 million. Now they don't have to make Wun-Wun any more, you'd imagine we'll be seeing a fair bit more of Ghost in the coming seasons. And who knows, maybe even Nymeria might make a triumphant return. To be honest it'll just be nice to see some Starks catching a break. Words by George Pavlou Images via HBO",producers basically couldn't afford to have him in the battle
2262,"Sia has apparently responded to a lawsuit from fans in Israel who claim her recent gig there was so bad that they want a refund. The stadium show at Tel Aviv's Yarkon Park saw Sia play for just 65 minutes, which is the main complaint in a class-action lawsuit filed in court. As is now customary ta Sia shows, the singer stood at the back of the stage during her performance, with a lampshade-style curtain of hair obscuring her face. The lawsuit says that it led to the show feeling ""lacklustre"". The lawsuit also complains that Sia's vocals and between-song chat was ""impersonal"", as she didn't mention being in Tel Aviv or Israel. The other main thrust of the complaint is that the venue's big screens showed pre-recorded films, rather than the gig, which left fans at the back of the park unable to see. Taking to Twitter earlier today (August 19), Sia wrote: ""This euro tour has been amazing. Thank you all for singing at the top of your lungs and for welcoming me with such open hearts."" She also wrote, perhaps more pertinently to the lawsuit: ""I put everything I have into my show- it's abstract for sure, but I'm singing my heart out live and every moment is purely intentional."" Sia's tour promoter, Ilan Elkayam, has already hit back at the lawsuit. Elkayam told IQ: ""We wish to emphasise that the show was extremely successful. We have received hundreds of comments from satisfied fans who thoroughly enjoyed the performance and production. In addition, it should be noted that, to the best of our knowledge, the claim was not submitted against Sia herself."" Sia is due to play at V Festival for her 'This Is Acting' album this weekend.","""I put everything I have into my show- it's abstract for sure, but I'm singing my heart out live and every moment is purely intentional."""
2263,"Today I found out what happens when you stick your head into a particle accelerator. Exhibit A: Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski, a Russian scientist who has the distinction of being the only person to ever stick his head in a running particle accelerator. Shockingly, he also managed to survive the ordeal and, all things considered, came out without too much damage. Bugorski was a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino, working with the Soviet particle accelerator: The Synchrotron U-70. On July 13, 1978, Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment. As he was leaning over the piece of equipment, he stuck his head through the part of the accelerator that the proton beam was running through. He reported seeing a flash that was ""brighter than a thousand suns"", but did not feel any pain when this happened. The beam itself measured 2000 gray as it entered Bugorski’s skull and about 3000 gray when it exited on the other side. A ""gray"" is an SI unit of energy absorbed from ionizing radiation. One gray is equal to the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of matter. An example where this is commonly used is in X-rays. For reference, absorption of over 5 grays at any time usually leads to death within 14 days. However, no one before had ever experienced radiation in the form of a proton beam moving at about the speed of light. As you can see from the picture, the beam entered the back of Bugorski’s head and came out around his nose. Shortly after this happened, Bugorski’s left half of his face swelled up beyond recognition. He was taken to the hospital and studied as this was something that had never been seen before and so they closely monitored him thereafter, fully expecting him to die within a few days at most. Although the skin on the part of his face and back of his head where the beam hit peeled off over the next few days and the beam had burned through his skull and brain tissue, Bugorski did not die and actually came through it all surprisingly well. Despite the beam going through his brain, his intellectual capacity remained the same as before. The few negative health drawbacks he did experience were not life threatening either. He lost the hearing in his left ear and experienced a constant unpleasant noise in that ear from then on. The left half of his face slowly became paralyzed over the course of the next two years. He also gets significantly more fatigued with mental work, though he did go on to get his PhD after this incident. The remaining side effects were occasional absence seizures and later tonic-clonic seizures, though these didn’t show up right away. The most bizarre side effect that occurred because of this has to do with his face. Looking at Bugorski now, you’d see the right half of his face looks like a normal wrinkled old man, but the left half of his face looks as if it was frozen in time 19 years ago. Apparently Botox’s got nothing on a particle accelerator’s proton beam for stopping wrinkles. .b Bonus Facts: During absence seizures, the person will often appear to be just staring off into space. There is no typical jerking or twitching as is associated with many other types of seizures. Absence seizure victims will often move from one location to another without purpose or thought behind it. What is happening here is, under normal circumstances, thalamacortical oscillations maintain normal consciousness of an individual; during absence seizures these are disrupted. A synchrotron is a cyclic particle accelerator where a magnetic field and an electric field are carefully synchronized with a traveling particle beam. The magnetic field turns the particles so they circulate; the electric field accelerates the particles. Tonic-Clonic seizures are more typically what most people think of when we think of seizures. During the ""tonic"" phase the person will lose consciousness and their muscles will suddenly tense. This typically only lasts a few seconds. During the ""clonic"" phase the muscles will start to contract and relax rapidly, causing the person to convulse sometimes severely. Bugorski went on to get his PhD after this incident and worked as a scientist for many years. In 1996, he applied for disabled status to receive his epilepsy medication free, but was turned down. He also tried to make himself available to Western researchers but was unable to afford to leave Protvino. Bugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna and they together have one son named Peter.","Although the skin on the part of his face and back of his head where the beam hit peeled off over the next few days and the beam had burned through his skull and brain tissue, Bugorski did not die and actually came through it all surprisingly well."

2274,"Typically, the impending release of a new iPhone model focuses on whatever cool and exciting new features Apple has in the works. The iPhone 7, though, is a bit different. In fact, it’s not unreasonable to say that the upcoming unveiling of the iPhone 7 has been marked by controversy more than anything else. According to a number of credible reports, Apple’s next-gen smartphone will ship without a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. And while Apple isn’t shy about discarding popular technologies to the curb, the 3.5mm headphone jack has effectively been around for more than 100 years and is as reliable and durable as it is universal. Suffice it to say, Apple’s rumored decision to scrap the tried and true jack on the iPhone 7 has elicited no shortage of heated debates. In one widely circulated piece, Nilay Patel of The Verge argued that removing the headphone jack was nothing short of "" user-hostile. "" In turn, we pointed out just a few weeks ago that Apple’s disdain for the 3.5mm headphone jack would make the iPhone 7 Apple’s riskiest iPhone release yet . After all, with no new groundbreaking features rumored to be part of the iPhone 7 design, removing the headphone jack might persuade a good number of users who might otherwise upgrade to simply stick with what they already have. Now for anyone worried about their beloved 3.5mm headphone jack completely disappearing, there’s hope on the horizon. According to a new research note from Deutsche Bank, Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7 will ship with a Lightning to 3.5mm dongle, thereby making the transition much more seamless. If this report proves to be true, it would certainly be a smart move by Apple. Indeed, it’s much more user-friendly than shipping Lightning headphones and requiring users who prefer using their old 3.5mm headphones to dole out cash for a dongle. Apple must recognize that abandoning the headphone jack is a huge and risky move. In turn, it probably appreciates that the transition away from the 3.5mm headphone jack won’t happen overnight and might even be met by a wave of backlash. That being the case, shipping a dongle — presumably one that’s not too clunky — inside of every new iPhone 7 box appears to be more than a reasonable compromise. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analysts also anticipate that the iPhone 7 will ship with a new color, a newly re-designed home button similar in operation to the trackpad on the MacBook, ""professional class water-proofing"" and more.",iPhone 7 will ship with a Lightning to 3.5mm dongle
2275,"Gun-controlled Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides throughout the year. The Chicago Tribune reports that there were a total of 779 homicides between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. That is an increase of 287 homicides over 2015 totals. There were 4,385 shootings — fatal and non-fatal combined — in gun-controlled Chicago during 2016. That is an increase of nearly 1,500 shootings over the 2,900 Time magazine reported for 2015. 2016 was marred by shooting after shooting in Chicago. In fact, by early September, the egregious violence in the city was so high that ABC News reported ""nearly 12"" people had been shot every day in the city from January 1 to the end of August. Chicago has been a testing ground for gun control for decades. The city put a ban on handgun ownership in place in 1982 and the Tribune reported that the next 10 years witnessed a ""41 percent"" jump in murders, ""compared with an 18 percent rise in the entire United States."" And why shouldn’t such a ban lead to an increase in murder? After all, when bans are enacted, only the criminals remain armed. The ban was overturned in 2010 via the Supreme Court ruling in McDonald v Chicago, but city leaders have worked diligently to preserve the vestiges of the ban at every turn in the road. Municipal and county limits on the number of gun stores allowed in Chicago, together with rules on the locations of those stores and a ridiculous amount of regulation on acquiring and carrying guns for self-defense, have coalesced to guarantee that criminals maintain an advantage similar to what they enjoyed when the ban was in place. The result of Chicago gun control is self-evident — bloody and repulsive, but self-evident none the less.","The Chicago Tribune reports that there were a total of 779 homicides between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016."

While most people point to your blood type, or your perfume, or a red meat-heavy diet, the real reason you might be a target has nothing to do with any of that. Turns out it’s actually because of the types of bacteria that exist on your skin. According to scientists, some bacteria secrete chemicals that have better smells than others.

His face softens to a grin as he answers an impossible question: ""There is no crucial time for growing hops. It’s all crucial."" As the general manager of Elk Mountain Farms, he’s charged with the health of 1,700 acres of precious soil. And while harvest is the most active time, Atkins says hop farmers work throughout the year. It’s spring in Bonner’s Ferry, Idaho and the only signs of hops are the inch-tall seedlings breaking through the soil to start a new year of growth. The snowcaps atop the forested mountain ranges that surround the farm are nearing its final stages of melting. If you had to mark the beginning of hop season, this would be it. ""Throughout the season starting in June, we would water and fertilize the plants,"" Atkins says. In July the bines will climb up 18 feet on hand-tied coconut husk twine. By mid-August, the hops will start to bloom and harvest will begin. The farm will be buzzing with the sounds of picking, cleaning, curing and drying hops. Atkins rarely takes long breaks from the farm because there are no off seasons when it comes to growing hops. But it’s his connection to Elk Mountain Farms that makes this responsibility a pleasure not a pain. ""I helped build the farm 29 years ago. This farm was established in 1987. When we first came here, this was nothing but pasture ground for cattle -- no poles, no facilities, there wasn’t even a road into the property,"" he says. As Atkins recalls, August Busch III was looking for another reliable source of hops, outside of Germany or Czechoslovakia, to ensure a steady supply for Anheuser-Busch. He picked Bonner’s Ferry because of the latitude and weather conditions. ""Elk Mountain Farms is roughly on the 49th parallel, which is key to the famed growing regions in Europe, which are also on the 49th parallel. That afforded him the opportunity from a weather-climate standpoint to have similar growing conditions,"" Atkins says. Hops grow between 35 and 55 degrees latitude, according to Bill Bauerle, professor of ecophysiology and plant stress physiology at the University of Colorado. But the ideal range is between 45 and 55 degrees latitude. ""Once you get above that latitude, then it starts to get too cold, then you can either have late spring frost that can kill them or an early freeze. Whereas when you go below 35 degrees, the days get too short for them,"" Bauerle says. The Hallertau region in Germany, which is the largest producer of hops in the world, sits at around the 49th parallel. While there are variables, the weather conditions in that region are similar to Bonner’s Ferry. Both have 16 hours of daylight from May through July. Summer highs average between 74 and 84 degrees in Bonner’s Ferry, while Ingolstadt, Germany ranges between 73 and 76 degrees. According to Bauerle, hop plants prefer long days when they’re growing. Some plants will downregulate if it gets too much sun -- in other words, the benefits of sunlight will reduce over time. ""Whereas with hops you almost can’t saturate them with full sunlight,"" he adds. ""That’s why in field conditions they plant them at such wide spacing, so they can maximize getting that light penetration to lower layers of the canopy, to keep the leaves photosynthetically active."" Elk Mountain Farms gets the benefit of a late spring, Atkins says, so the plants can grow at a more natural rate. This is where Atkins’ hops end up, before their metamorphosis into beer. He doesn’t want hops emerging too quickly in the spring, and adds, ""What happens if they grow too early is that you end up pruning them several times. At some point, you exhaust their ability to reemerge."" Hop production at the farm was soft for a few years because of low demand. It wasn’t until Goose Island was acquired by Anheuser-Busch that the farm was put to full use. ""As Goose Island grew, as our needs for hops developed, we decided we need to go check out the soil, go talk to the farmers. We need to start growing some of our hops there,"" says Goose Island’s head brewer and hop expert Keith Gabbett. Once the hops finish their journey from the field and through the picker, kiln and baler, it’s out of Atkins’ hands. He must pass the baton to Gabbett and Goose Island brewmaster Jared Jankoski, who are both based in Chicago. Goose Island started as a brewpub in Chicago by John Hall. Since its founding in 1988, the company has grown from a small microbrewery to an international brand. The Fulton Street brewery in Chicago is where Jankoski oversees brewing and production of an array of Goose Island beers. This is where Atkins’ hops end up, before its metamorphosis into beer. There are four key ingredients in beer: water, hops, malted barley and yeast. The beer-making process includes milling and mashing of grains to extract a liquid called wort. The wort goes through a lauter tun to strain the grain and get the sugars out. Hops are added in two phases: the brew kettle, where wort is boiled, and the whirlpool, which separates the liquid from excess materials. A heat exchanger cools the wort down by mixing it with cold water. Yeast is added before fermentation. Fermentation happens when sugary wort converts into carbon dioxide and alcohol. The process takes eight to 10 days. Then the beer gets cooled down to 32 degrees and makes its way to kegs and bottles. ""I think that the hop creates the backbone for the beer. Without the hops, without the bitterness they contribute, without the flavor and aromas they contribute to the beer, the beer would be flat,"" Gabbett says. Goose Island IPA uses a variety of hops including Centennial, Cascade and Pilgrim, and is known by its fruity aroma. Jankoski describes it as a citrus profile that can lean orange at times with a clean pine character. ""It’s got a high balancing bitterness to it,"" he adds. ""Hops are very important to Goose IPA. They provide the balance and flavor to contrast the malt on your palate. And then aromatically they’re very inviting to you as you bring the glass up to your mouth you as take a drink. You get a nice waft of the hop aromas."" According to Bauerle, the bitterness in India Pale Ales (IPA) comes from the alpha concentration. ""So you might have two identical IPAs and bitterness units, but they taste different and that has to do with the essential oils content,"" he adds. On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, a few bar patrons relax at Goose Island’s brewpub on Clybourn Avenue in Chicago’s Lincoln Park. The ambiance is heightened with warm wood, red brick and the aroma of beer. After all of the science behind growing hops and brewing beer, this is where the hundreds of days of work are tested. ""Goose Island is probably on the top echelons with IPAs. Very full-bodied. It’s a little bit hoppy, but it’s a nice hoppy, where it’s not over. It doesn’t have that bite but it has that really nice aftertaste,"" says Jay Gallagher, a fan of Goose Island IPA. He chats with us and Goose Island Brewery bartender Keegan McGuire. Beer fans in America have expanded their palate and desire more complex flavors. According to the market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer volume sales grew by 18.8 percent in 2015. IPAs fared best with a growth of 47 percent by volume in 2014. In 2009, about 9.1 million barrels of craft beer were produced in the United States. That number rose to 24.5 million in 2015, according to data from the Brewers Association. Back at Elk Mountain Farms, Atkins is more focused on soil conditions than market conditions. He knows that growing hops is a small part of an extensive process, but he’s dedicated decades of his life to get it right. ""When you hoist that glass of beer, you were just a small part of it. But, you were still one of the keys to it. There’s this whole sense of gratification from having watch this all grow and mature, along with all the people that make this happen,"" Atkins says. ""You get one shot a year. That’s all you get.""","""When you hoist that glass of beer, you were just a small part of it. But, you were still one of the keys to it.

2286,"BOSTON - A group of German hackers claimed to have cracked the iPhone fingerprint scanner on Sunday, just two days after Apple Inc launched the technology that it promises will better protect devices from criminals and snoopers seeking access. If the claim is verified, it will be embarrassing for Apple which is betting on the scanner to set its smartphone apart from new models of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and others running the Android operating system of Google Inc. Two prominent iPhone security experts told Reuters that they believed the German group, known as the Chaos Computing Club, or CCC, had succeeded in defeating Apple's Touch ID, though they had not personally replicated the work. One of them, Charlie Miller, co-author of the iOS Hacker's Handbook, described the work as ""a complete break"" of Touch ID security. ""It certainly opens up a new possibility for attackers."" Apple representatives did not respond to requests for comment. CCC, one the world's largest and most respected hacking groups, posted a video on its website that appeared to show somebody accessing an iPhone 5S with a fabricated print. The site described how members of its biometrics team had cracked the new fingerprint reader, one of the few major high-tech features added to the latest version of the iPhone. The group said they targeted Touch ID to knock down reports about its ""marvels,"" which suggested it would be difficult to crack. ""Fingerprints should not be used to secure anything. You leave them everywhere, and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints,"" a hacker named Starbug was quoted as saying on the CCC's site. The group said it defeated Touch ID by photographing the fingerprint of an iPhone's user, then printing it on to a transparent sheet, which it used to create a mold for a ""fake finger."" CCC said similar processes have been used to crack ""the vast majority"" of fingerprint sensors on the market. ""I think it's legit,"" said Dino Dai Zovi,"" another co-author of the iOS Hacker's Handbook. ""The CCC doesn't fool around or over-hype, especially when they are trying to make a political point."" Touch ID, which was only introduced on the top-of-the-line iPhone 5S, lets users unlock their devices or make purchases on iTunes by simply pressing their finger on the home button. It uses a sapphire crystal sensor embedded in the button. Data used for verification is encrypted and stored in a secure enclave of the phone's A7 processor chip. Two security experts who sponsored an impromptu competition offering cash and other prizes to the first hackers who cracked the iPhone said they had reviewed the information posted on the CCC website, but wanted more documentation. ""We are simply awaiting a full video documentation and walk through of the process that they have claimed,"" said mobile security researcher Nick DePetrillo, who started the contest with another security expert, Robert Graham. ""When they deliver that video we will review it."" The two of them each put up $100 toward a prize for the contest winner, then set up a website inviting others to contribute. While the booty now includes more than $13,000 in cash, it was not clear that the CCC would receive the full payout, even if DePetrillo and Graham declared them winners. A micro venture capital firm known as I/O Capital, which had offered to pay $10,000 of the prize money, issued a press release late on Sunday saying that it would make its own determination about who won the contest.","The group said it defeated Touch ID by photographing the fingerprint of an iPhone's user, then printing it on to a transparent sheet, which it used to create a mold for a ""fake finger."""

2289,"This year, other scientists have argued that life originated on Mars, due to a mineral found in Martian meteorites, thought to be crucial to the genesis of life. BUT, a new book by American ecologist Dr. Ellis Silver offers arguments, based on human physiology, that humans as species may not have evolved alongside other life on Earth – but arrived from elsewhere, brought here by aliens as recently as a few tens of thousands of years ago. This is a BIG claim, however, the facts that Silver puts on the table will make you say ""how did I not realized this sooner!!"" Silver, an environmentalist who is currently working with the effort to clean plastic debris from the Pacific, says his book aims to provoke debate – and is based on scientific work on the difference between humans and other animals. ""The Earth approximately meets our needs as a species, but perhaps not as strongly as whoever brought us here initially thought,"" Silver said in an interview with Yahoo news. ""Mankind is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet, yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill-equipped for Earth’s environment: harmed by sunlight, a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods, ridiculously high rates of chronic disease, and more,"" Dr. Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity. He also says that it is strange that babies’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant. ""No other truly native species on this planet has this problem,"" he says. Silver also points out to the ""extra"" 223 genes in human beings, which are not found in any other species, and to the lack of a fossil ""missing link"". ""Lizards can sunbathe for as long as they like – and many of them do. We can just about get away with it for a week or two. But day after day in the sun? Forget it. You might as well just lie down on the freeway and wait for a bus to hit you."" We are dazzled by the sun, which is also odd, says Silver – most animals are not. ""We are all chronically ill,"" says Silver. ""Indeed, if you can find a single person who is 100% fit and healthy and not suffering from some (perhaps hidden or unstated) condition or disorder (there’s an extensive list in the book) I would be extremely surprised – I have not been able to find anyone."" Silver continues. It’s like we desperately try to hide the fact that we do not fully belong in this Nature we try to fit in. We say that we evolved but, if we truly evolved here, shouldn’t we be more in connection with Nature instead of being less and less, to a point that we even harm life around us? Something just does not seem right. ""I believe that many of our problems stem from the simple fact that our internal body clocks have evolved to expect a 25 hour day (this has been proven by sleep researchers), but the Earth’s day is only 24 hours. This is not a modern condition – the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind’s history on Earth."" There is another key element we usually tend to ignore. Many people say that they don’t feel like they belong on Earth, nor feel at home here, says Dr. Ellis Silver. And this fact is not something to see as irrelevant, especially not if the majority of the human population feels like this. ""This suggests (to me at least) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet, and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species."" says Silver What if we migrated here from Mars? And this, believe it or not, is not as farfetched as it seems. Scientists recently discovered that Mars had a strong Magnetic field before it became a wasteland. Mars is the only planet in our Solar System that has a day of 25 hours, it is further away from The Sun than Earth, it has weaker gravity and it was discovered that Mars had large amounts of water in the past. What if there was some kind of destruction of global proportions and we had to migrate to save our species? This would also prove the stories of Humanity being more evolved in the past, but because of an unknown incident we ""fell"" from ""heaven"" on earth, and went through a phase of forgetting. ""My thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life, but evolved elsewhere and was transported to Earth (as fully evolved Homo sapiens) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago,"" says Dr. Ellis Silver.

2295,"We should teach our children to self-regulate their sweet and chocolate intake, instead of making them fussier eaters by obsessively only allowing them to eat black bean and beetroot brownies, instead of the real deal Ten years ago, my husband became sick with an autoimmune disease, and nutrition played a significant role in his recovery. What did I do when he got better? I became the food police, imagining that if I could control the food he and my children ate, I could keep us all healthy and safe. I figured this made me a magnificent mother and wife as well; if my family was guzzling artichokes and homemade soups and never saw sweets or chocolate, I deserved high marks. I threw out everything I deemed unhealthy and made quinoa and kale daily staples. I talked about nutrition constantly and took every meal as an opportunity to teach my kids about healthy eating. Meals were no longer fun, they were lessons. Not surprisingly, my kids became pickier and more resistant instead of embracing all the wonderful health foods I was parading in front of them. When I realised what I was doing, I had to actively recalibrate, especially the way in which I talked about food to my children and the frequency with which I talked about it. Of course it was beneficial to teach them about which foods help them grow and which ones should be consumed in moderation. But making my goal at every meal to get them to eat as many healthy foods as possible, and to cut out all the unhealthy ones, was missing the point. As parents, we should focus on creating independent eaters: kids who have a healthy relationship with food, who can self-regulate sweets and who enjoy all kinds of foods without a parent persuading them to eat. It took a while for me to change my ways, but I did. I still feed my family mainly whole foods and tons of vegetables, but my boys will also occasionally have sweets and soft drinks. We love milkshakes, and our brownies are no longer made with black beans and beets: they actually have some chocolate and sugar in them. What happens when parents focus too much on getting children to eat? Every time we talk about food while eating, whether to encourage children to eat more vegetables, praise them for finishing a healthy meal or comment on the amount of sugar they are consuming, they feel they are being watched and judged. They take these comments personally; they feel they are ""bad"" if they like unhealthy foods, and worry that you are disappointed that they don’t like the healthy ones. It has been shown that restricting foods makes the controlled foods more desirable, and rewarding children for eating healthy foods makes them like those foods less. The message here is that too much pressure on kids can make their eating habits worse. Most of them inherently know how to eat without a parent pressuring them. They also know how to stop eating when they are full. Actively persuading kids to eat confuses their natural self-regulation. It also complicates the parent-child dynamic, creating an unnecessary point of conflict. So even though I am in the business of healthy food, and love nothing more than educating families about nutrition, I have a New Year’s resolution for parents who are guilty of adopting the food police role: stop talking about food. If your child doesn't want to eat breakfast, don’t force her. If your child doesn’t like broccoli, don’t promise him it will make him big and strong. Even if you are excited she ate a healthy meal, don’t cheerlead. And definitely don’t entice him to eat a healthy dinner with the prospect of dessert. Then follow these pieces of advice. I bet you will have a delicious, less-pressured 2017 and your children will be eating well, all on their own. Stop talking about nutrition, especially during meals, unless your children specifically ask a food question. Set regular meal times. Serve healthy foods for meals and snacks. Model good eating habits. Let your child decide whether he wants to eat what you have prepared, and how much. Do not get emotionally invested in your child's food intake. Do not be a short-order cook, customising meals for picky eaters. Never shame or tease your child for being picky. Do not demonise food, calling it ""bad"", ""toxic"" or ""junk"" (all words I have used, I’ll admit). Have fun at the table so meals become positive, relaxed experiences, for both you and your children.

2296,"It's amazing to think that just 10 years ago, flat-rate digital music streaming services were a mere gleam in the eye of industry executives. It was as recently as September 2007 that Rick Rubin, then co-head of Columbia Records, put forward the idea as a way of combating online music piracy and file-sharing. ""You'd pay, say, $19.95 a month, and the music will come from anywhere you'd like,"" he told the New York Times. ""In this new world, there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car, from your cell phone, from your computer, from your television."" As it turned out, he was essentially describing Spotify, which launched just over a year later. He even got the price right. In those heady days, when the pound was a lot stronger, $19.95 was equivalent to £10, which, give or take a penny, is the monthly cost of Spotify Premium in the UK today. But Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed, raising a big question mark over its business model. Industry accolade Of course, Spotify isn't the only streaming platform out there. Others have joined it over the past decade, including Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music and Deezer, as well as high-resolution music services Tidal and Qobuz. But Spotify is seen as the leader, with more than 100 million users, 40 million of them paid-up subscribers to its Premium tier. The Swedish firm is now a major player in 60 countries, including the world's biggest music market, the US, where streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption last year. Reflecting the huge impact that Spotify has had, its chief executive, Daniel Ek, has just topped US music industry magazine Billboard's latest Power 100 list of the biggest movers and shakers in the business. ""For the first time since [former file-sharing service] Napster decimated music sales, the recorded music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man,"" Billboard said in its citation. The magazine also hailed Spotify as ""the place fans discover music as well as consume it"", pointing to its promoted playlists, including its Discover Weekly service. Royalty woes However, the clock is ticking for Spotify as it hatches its plans to go public. The firm originally planned to float this year, but according to the TechCrunch website, this could now be delayed until 2018. There are various issues behind this move, not least of which is that Spotify needs to conclude new long-term licensing deals with the big three record companies - Universal, Sony and Warner - to avoid the risk of suddenly losing major chunks of its content. It's thought that Spotify currently pays 55% of its revenue to record labels in royalties, with additional money going to music publishers. In the interest of finally becoming a profitable company, it would like to lower that percentage, but this is unlikely to go down well with artists, who argue that the royalties they receive from streaming are unfairly low as it is. Brutal arithmetic But if it waits too long before floating, it could face a serious cash crisis. In March last year, the firm raised $1bn from investors at an interest rate of 5% a year, plus a discount of 20% on shares once the initial public offering (IPO) of shares takes place. However, under the terms of the agreement, the interest rate goes up by one percentage point and the discount by 2.5 percentage points every six months until the IPO happens. So as time goes on, Spotify must pay ever larger sums to its creditors just to settle the interest on its loan, while the amount of money it can raise from its IPO is trimmed by an ever greater amount. Unless Mr Ek can get the better of this brutal arithmetic, the future looks tough for Spotify. But at the same time, as Billboard says, ""the entire music business now has an interest in its success"". ""If it's not already too big to fail, it's headed in that direction quickly,"" concludes the magazine.","Spotify is yet to make a profit, while plans to float the firm on the stock market have reportedly been delayed"

2298,"Twitter has confirmed it is experimenting with graying out the profiles of users it deems are posting ""sensitive content,"" displaying a warning to others before they can read their tweets.

Media, such as photos or videos, can already be reported as sensitive, with Twitter having the ability to mark an entire user’s media posts as sensitive permanently if they so choose. However, this new step verges away from stopping everyone immediately seeing pornography or graphic images to something potentially more worrying. Abhimanyu Ghoshal writing at TheNextWeb posited some of the negative outcomes, imagining if ""a potential employer looked up your profile and found that it was greyed out; it’s possible they could get the wrong impression about your online presence. Or, if you had an important idea to share, but people couldn’t see your tweets because you cursed once... [Twitter] needs to be careful that it doesn’t end up censoring its users... and stifl[ing] free speech."" Twitter’s ""safety features"" are done via an opt-out system, whereby users have to go into their profile and deliberately change their settings in order to ensure that they see everything they want to. There is merit to allowing people to avoid things they do not want to — Gab, the free speech alternative to Twitter, implemented a word-filtering feature that Twitter later adopted — but this was the choice of the users, and not forced upon them as default. This is not the first time Twitter has implemented new features that tend towards censorship. If accounts are seen to have ""potentially abusive"" behavior, they are locked out for a certain period of time.

2299,"Twenty years ago, a group of researchers began tracking the personalities of 1,420 low income children in North Carolina. At the time, the goal was simple: to observe the mental conditions of kids living in rural America. But then a serendipitous thing happened. Four years into The Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth, the families of roughly a quarter of the children saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in annual income. They were members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and a casino had just been built on the reservation. From that point on every tribal citizen earned a share of the profits, meaning about an extra $4,000 a year per capita. For these families, the extra padding was a blessing, enough to boost household incomes by almost 20 percent on average. But for the fields of psychology, sociology and economics, it has been a gold mine, too. The sudden change in fortunes has offered a rare glimpse into the subtle but important ways in which money can alter a child’s life. The dataset is so rich that researchers continue to study it to this day. ""It would be almost impossible to replicate this kind of longitudinal study,"" said Randall Akee, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the impact of changes in household income. ""Especially for a sample this large. This is the sort of circumstance you dream of as a researcher."" Seizing the opportunity, Akee, along with a team of other researchers, recently revisited the data to analyze each child’s personality both in the years before the casino was built and in those after. As part of the original study, the children and parents were asked a series of questions, designed to measure, among other things, a number of personality traits. The same questions were posed every other year, for a decade. Akee's goal was to observe any changes—positive or negative—resulting from the extra household income. Their findings, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research last month, are nothing short of remarkable. ""This was hugely important to the development of the children, to their wellbeing"" said Akee. ""And the effect wasn’t small either—it was actually fairly large."" Not only did the extra income appear to lower the instance of behavioral and emotional disorders among the children, but, perhaps even more important, it also boosted two key personality traits that tend to go hand in hand with long-term positive life outcomes. The first is conscientiousness. People who lack it tend to lie, break rules and have trouble paying attention. The second is agreeableness, which leads to a comfort around people and aptness for teamwork. And both are strongly correlated with various forms of later life success and happiness. The researchers also observed a slight uptick in neuroticism, which, they explained, is a good sign. Neuroticism is generally considered to be a positive trait so long as one does not have too much of it. ""We're talking about all sorts of good, positive, long-term things,"" said Emilia Simeonova, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies the economics of health, and one of the paper's co-authors. ""There are very powerful correlations between conscientiousness and agreeableness and the ability to hold a job, to maintain a steady relationship. The two allow for people to succeed socially and professionally."" Remarkably, the change was the most pronounced in the children who were the most deficient. ""This actually reduces inequality with respect to personality traits,"" said Akee. ""On average, everyone is benefiting, but in particular it's helping the people who need it the most."" Why exactly this happened with the children neither Akee nor any of his co-researchers can say with absolute certainty. Not even Jane Costello, a professor at Duke University who was part of the team that initiated the original study and co-authored the recent paper can say. But they have a few ideas, based on observable changes in the families after the casino was built and the extra money started to flow in. They know, based on the interviews with parents, that the relationship between spouses tended to improve as a result. They also know that the relationship between the parents and their children tended to improve. And they know that parents tended to drink less alcohol. ""There is a lot of literature that shows in order to change outcomes among children you are best off treating the parents first,"" said Simeonova. ""And these are really clear changes in the parents."" There's also the question of stress, which the extra money helps relieve—even if only a little. While the added income wasn't enough to allow parents to quit their jobs, it's a base level that helped with rent and food and other basic expenses. That, Akee said, is powerful enough itself. ""We know that the thing poor couples fight about the most is money,"" he said. ""Off the bat, this means a more harmonious family environment."" And some of the families, given the boost, even moved to areas with slightly better census tracts in terms of both income and education. They were, in other words, able to expose their children to a different group of peers. For the most part, scientists agree that the window for improvement in a child's cognitive abilities is short-lived. By the age of about 8, children have set themselves on a path, Akee said. What comes next happens, more or less, within the confines of the limits that were created in their early years. One's personality, on the other hand, is malleable well into adolescence. What's more, the changes tend to be fairly permanent. ""All of the evidence points to the idea if they change in the teenage years, they will stay changed forever,"" said Akee. ""In this case, the kids will likely maintain a different level of conscientiousness and agreeableness for life."" Experts have known about the power of intervention for some time. A lot of previous research has shown that educational interventions can have sizable impacts on personality traits and, in turn, life outcomes. But rarely, if ever before, have researchers been able to observe the impact of a change in income across such a large group. The takeaway isn't that casinos are inherently benevolent institutions. But rather that money—even modest sums—can be a pretty powerful thing. And for reasons most would likely overlook. ""We know that low income kids are worse off in a number of ways, in terms of cognitive abilities and behavioral disorders, than their counterparts in much more affluent areas,"" said Simeonova. ""Now we have a sense of what even just a little money can do to change these things, to change their lives.""","Not only did the extra income appear to lower the instance of behavioral and emotional disorders among the children, but, perhaps even more important, it also boosted two key personality traits that tend to go hand in hand with long-term positive life outcomes."
2301,"The Man Who Pays His Way: Are all-female flight crews anything more than symbolic? Passengers aboard easyJet flight 8275 from Gatwick to Madrid on Wednesday encountered two surprises. The first: they were kept waiting on the ground for nearly two hours because of a strike by French air-traffic controllers. The second: all six crew members on the Airbus A320 were women. The arithmetic shows this to be a rare event. While many cabin crew are female, men outnumber women by around 16 to one on the flight deck.  When I checked on the flight-deck gender split three months ago with all the leading airlines serving UK passengers, a remarkably consistent pattern emerged: at British Airways, easyJet, Monarch and Ryanair, just 6 per cent of crew are female. Flybe performs slightly better than the norm; 7.5 per cent of the airline’s pilots are female, while just 3 per cent of Thomson’s pilots are women. All other things being equal, only one flight in about 300 to and from the UK is flown by two women; 17 have have one male and one female pilot; and the remaining 282 are two-man operations. But not all other things are equal, because the proportion of captains who are female is even smaller than that 6 per cent. At Thomas Cook Airlines, for example, 8 per cent of first officers — junior pilots — are female, but among captains, the proportion of women falls to below 2 per cent. Worldwide, the figures are even worse, with only 3 per cent of pilots worldwide female — raising the odds of a two-woman flight crew to a shocking one in 1,000 Pilots were warned about the French strike by a NOTAM — a NOtice To AirMen, which most of the time is well aimed.  As the captain of that easyJet flight said, ""It is hard to think of another high profile profession where women are so under-represented."" She is Kate McWilliams, at 27 years old also the world’s youngest female commercial captain. The flight on International Women’s Day was more than just a gesture: easyJet has set an ambitious target of increasing the proportion of its female pilots aiming for 20 per cent of new-intake pilots by 2020. The airline has named an Airbus A320 jet after the pioneering female aviator, Amy Johnson, and that was the aircraft used for the pioneering Gatwick-Madrid flight. It wasn’t the first time an airline has highlighted the high-altitude gender gap; a year ago, Royal Brunei Airlines operated its first all-female-pilot service, with a twist of irony to Saudi Arabia — where conservative clerics ban women from driving.  Given the hostile attitude to homosexuality in the Sultanate, I fear we may be waiting rather longer for the Bruneian carrier to dispatch a flight with openly gay pilots. Across at easyJet’s giant rival, Ryanair, one female pilot has become an online celebrity as well as a role model: Maria Pettersson, from Gothenburg, combines her work as a first office with a travel and lifestyle blog. Talking of lifestyle: could one reason for the gender imbalance be the uncertain and disruptive schedule that pilots have to handle? I don’t believe so, because there are plenty of female cabin crew who cope with equally onerous rosters. Civil Aviation Authority flight-deck rules that apply only to women pilots don’t help. Pregnant women can fly as a passenger on easyJet up to the 35th week of gestation, but under CAA regulations the limit is 26 weeks. ""After this point, the certificate shall be suspended,"" instructs the authority, adding a provision that makes having a baby sound like an affliction: ""The suspension shall be lifted after full recovery following the end of the pregnancy."" To see how the rails compare with the skies, I asked Eurostar how many of its train drivers are female. Just two out of 62, which means that men outnumber women by 30 to one. Gender stereotyping in transport seems deeply ingrained — as do the attitudes of some men. When I first wrote about the easyJet initiative to recruit more female pilots, one reader added this unhelpful comment: ""I wonder if they'd give my mother-in-law a job. Can't be much difference between flying a broomstick and flying a plane.""","While many cabin crew are female, men outnumber women by around 16 to one on the flight deck."

2303,"The Aquaponics: Resilience Food Farm at the University of Sheffield. Credit: University of Sheffield Feeding a growing world population is one of the greatest challenges society faces – and fish poo could be the answer, according to a group of students at the University of Sheffield. A team of second year undergraduates have today (8 June 2016) opened a Resilience Food Farm on campus, combining fish farming and vegetable growing – using waste from the fish as a fertiliser. The fish will produce ammonia, which is translated into nitrates by beneficial bacteria. The plants then suck the nitrates out of the water and the clean water goes back to the fish. The process is known as aquaponics, combining hydroponics (growing vegetables in water) and aquaculture (growing fish). The students will grow leafy greens such as chard, lettuce, rocket and sorrel, and experiment with broad beans, strawberries and leeks, to test the aquaponics system as a method for producing sustainable food for the future. The project is part of Achieve More: 10bn – a pioneering initiative by the University where second year students from across all Faculties came together to explore the challenges the world will face as the population reaches 10 billion. ""We need to grow food in more places – for example, in the nooks and crannies of cities and towns,"" said Professor Hamish Cunningham, who is leading the aquaponics project. The video will load shortly ""The more we can meet our basic needs like food and energy in our local communities, the more resilient those communities become – and the less scarce the resources we use in the process, the more sustainable our lifestyles become."" Aquaponics is a high density, low-impact agricultural method of creating clean food sustainably which may be seen as a positive alternative to mass production, factory farming and air miles. As part of their work, the students will also assess what will work best in the UK's climate and what costs are involved in building and running this kind of system. Achieve More is a new addition to University's curriculum and gives undergraduates the chance to work alongside students from other disciplines to develop potential solutions for a range of real-life global problems. Credit: University of Sheffield It gives all students at the University the opportunity to extend their academic and personal development by combining research-informed subject knowledge with wider transferable skills, professional competence, cultural agility and real world engagement. Professor Wyn Morgan, Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Learning and Teaching at the University of Sheffield, said: ""Collaboration across different disciplines is a really important way of getting an understanding of a common problem. ""The notion that a single discipline has the answer to a particular problem is not right – we need to take different views from different disciplines to get a full and complete picture of the problem, and how to solve it.""

2308,"Easter is the Christian celebration of the resurrection of Jesus, but the seasonal chocolate eggs and the bunny who delivers them are nowhere to be found in scripture. The exact origins of the Easter bunny are clouded in mystery. One theory is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from pagan tradition, specifically the festival of Eostre—a goddess of fertility whose animal symbol was a bunny. Rabbits, known for their energetic breeding, have traditionally symbolized fertility. Eggs are also representative of new life, and it's believed that decorating eggs for Easter dates back to the 13th century. Hundreds of years ago, churches had their congregations abstain from eggs during Lent, allowing them to be consumed again on Easter. According to History.com, in the 19th century Russian high society started exchanging ornately decorated eggs—even jewel encrusted—on Easter. But how did the Easter Bunny begin delivering eggs on American shores? According to History.com , the theory with the most evidence is that the floppy-eared bearer of candy came over with German immigrants: According to some sources, the Easter bunny first arrived in America in the 1700s with German immigrants who settled in Pennsylvania and transported their tradition of an egg-laying hare called ""Osterhase"" or ""Oschter Haws."" Their children made nests in which this creature could lay its colored eggs. Eventually, the custom spread across the U.S. and the fabled rabbit’s Easter morning deliveries expanded to include chocolate and other types of candy and gifts, while decorated baskets replaced nests. Additionally, children often left out carrots for the bunny in case he got hungry from all his hopping. Bunnies aren't the animal traditionally associated with Easter in every country. Some identify the holiday with other types of animals like foxes or cuckoo birds .",Eostre—a goddess of fertility whose animal symbol was a bunny

But the curve that men are most interested in are NOT the breast or butt....so what curves then? #2 All About The Spine The study showed that men do not care the size of the butt or any other part of the female anatomy – they simply like an exaggerated curve in the spine and back of a woman. ""Men who preferred these women would have had mates who were better able to provide for fetus and offspring, and who would have been able to carry out multiple pregnancies without injury,"" psychologist David Lewis stated. #3 No Matter The Size A second study was conducted to determine what it is about the spine curve that arouses men so much...and its the femininity associated with the curved back.

2316,"""There’s no check on this,"" said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. ""Once NSO’s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they’re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place."" The NSO Group’s capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects. The NSO Group’s spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws. It was taking advantage of three such flaws in Apple software — since fixed — when it was discovered by researchers last month. The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target’s personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology. Photo The founders of NSO Group, Omri Lavie, left, and Shalev Hulio. Credit NSO Group Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group’s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions. The company’s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013. ""Our intelligence systems are subject to Mexico’s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,"" Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. ""They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law."" Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week’s disclosures. For the last six years, the NSO Group’s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones — including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems — without leaving a trace. Among the Pegasus system’s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls ""room tap"" can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone’s own microphone. Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone’s web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency’s server in real time. In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including ""over the air stealth installation,"" tailored text messages and emails, through public Wi-Fi hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the old-fashioned way, by spies in person. Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500,000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users — on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal. You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter. What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is ""unlimited access to a target’s mobile devices."" In short, the company says: You can ""remotely and covertly collect information about your target’s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities — whenever and wherever they are."" And, its proposal adds, ""It leaves no traces whatsoever.""",The NSO Group’s spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws.
2320,"There's a colloquialism that hedge fund managers are ""masters of the universe."" These investors take big risks betting on the market, but the reward has usually been pretty significant. Let's not forget, five hedge fund managers made over $1 billion in 2015. Based on recent outlooks, however, the reign of these ""masters"" may be coming to an end. Everywhere you look, it appears that doom and gloom is surrounding the industry. From competitors to analysts and even to the managers of hedge funds themselves, everyone is acknowledging that these funds are going through a rough patch. It's all over Let's get the obvious out of the way: Hedge fund performance is abysmal. Funds are underperforming their benchmarks and many are losing investors money. For an industry that is founded on the idea that it can produce alpha, or better returns than the broad market, even being in-line is a disappointment. Hedge funds typically charge high fees to deliver the alpha to their investors. When they're not performing, more attention is paid to these fees. That focus has coincided with the growth of lower-cost alternatives, such as liquid alternatives, which provide hedge fund-like investments with lower fees. Add that up and you've got some problems. Tony James, president of private-equity giant Blackstone, told Bloomberg this week that he expects one-quarter of all current assets in hedge funds to be yanked out in the next year. ""It’s kind of a day of reckoning that we face here,"" James told Bloomberg TV. ""There will be a shrinkage in the industry and it will be painful. That’s going to be pretty painful for an awful lot of places."" A 25% drop in assets might sound pretty dramatic, but there are those who think it may be even worse. K.C. Nelson at alternative investor Driehaus Capital Management, expects a brutal reduction in the number of funds over the next few years. ""I believe there will be a culling of hedge funds like we've never seen before,"" he said in a letter to investors. ""I'd estimate the number of funds gets cut in half over the next couple of years."" Even Dan Loeb, manager of the hedge fund Third Point, said that it has been ""one of the most catastrophic periods of hedge fund performance"" and that many funds won't survive. ""There is no doubt that we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds and certain strategies,"" he said in a letter to investors in April. Now questions are being asked about the entire hedge fund business model. According to Brad Balter, CEO of Balter Capital Management, the model has broken down, and there is nothing to do to repair it. ""The mechanism to raise capital in a hedge fund is broken,"" he told Business Insider. Balter, whose firm provides liquid alts strategies, said that hedge funds start by getting seed money from a high-net worth family office. Then the fund-of-fund community would help build the fund from there, until the hedge fund became institutionally viable and larger pension plans would invest to grow it even further. Now, according to Balter, there is such a proliferation of hedge funds that many family offices are skeptical of investing because they aren't seeing the growth. The middle ground made up of fund-of-funds is also struggling and receiving redemptions. Finally, pension funds from California to New York are starting to pull their money out of hedge funds. ""It's over for hedge funds,"" said Balter. ""Yes, there will be hedge fund-like structures, but this is not a cyclical thing, it's a secular thing that has been been building up for a long time."" This too shall pass To some in the industry, however, all is not lost. Many hedge fund managers have said this is simply a cyclical event and a case of too much attention being lavished on hedge fund performance. ""Today's reports of hedge fund redemptions totaling $15 billion in Q1 2016 might sound like a big shift in favor from the sector, but it is important to note that this represents only around half of one per cent of total AUM invested,"" wrote Jack Inglis, CEO of the hedge fund industry trade group Alternative Investment Management Association in a recent blog post. ""Outflows from equity and bond mutual funds over the same period have been much more."" Inglis also noted that hedge funds have outperformed most other investment strategies over the past 25 years, so to take the short-term view would be unwise. This may actually be a good thing The thing is, the closure of many hedge funds may end up being a good thing for managers in the long run. Not for all managers, obviously, but for those that can make it through the tough times. Currently there are a large number of hedge funds. In a June 2015, a report showed that there were a record 10,149 registered hedge funds. The staggering number of funds has ""polluted"" the returns of hedge funds, said Balter, as all of these big-time firms chase the same ideas. Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management has decried the crowding of trades by hedge funds, making it impossible to anyone to generate returns. So whether you call it a ""culling"" or a ""washout,"" decreasing the number of funds investing could allow the survivors a little more elbow room to operate. Only time will tell.",Funds are underperforming their benchmarks and many are losing investors money
2326,"The email from Disney came in January of 2013, confirming what had already been rumored for the last couple of days -– J.J. Abrams had been hired to direct ""Star Wars: Episode VII."" I specifically remember this because I had just landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, after returning from the Sundance Film Festival. I thought about this a week ago -- when once again I landed at JFK for the same reason –- because, one year later, that’s still all we really know about ""Episode VII."" This is kind of odd. Okay, fine, Abrams has officially confirmed that R2-D2 will be in the movie -– which, on a scale of revelations, ranks right up there with ""The new ‘Star Wars’ will open with a title scroll"" or ""Rob Ford likes to be tickled."" Oh, and yes, Abrams recently confirmed that the new script (that he co-wrote with Lawrence Kasdan) is finished. Well, I’d hope so, since this movie comes out next year and all. For a comparison, ""The Phantom Menace"" started filming in June of 1997, just two years shy of its release, whereas ""Episode VII"" has yet to even make a casting announcement. Then again, the original ""Star Wars"" started filming in March of 1976, only 14 months before its release. So, based on the final product of the above two movies, the lesson here is that reading into a film’s production schedule in an attempt to predict the quality of a movie is a good way to be wrong. So, what do we know? Speaking of that script: poor Michael Arndt. The ""Toy Story 3"" writer will now go down as a footnote; the guy who wrote the fist ""Episode VII"" script that has nothing to do with the final movie. Someday, his script will sit beside Leigh Brackett’s curious first draft of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as nothing more than an interesting piece of trivia. (Though, like Brackett’s draft, I do hope someday we’ll get to read Arndt’s work.) The Hollywood Reporter ran a story a few weeks ago revealing the reason for Arndt’s script being tossed was that Abrams wants ""Episode VII"" to focus on the characters from the original trilogy -– Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa -– as opposed to their offspring. This set off a some spirited Internet debate between those who want to see more of Han, Luke and Leia and those who want a new story. The thing is: Han, Luke and Leia are the big three of ""Star Wars."" Lightning struck when these characters were put together onscreen in 1977 and it’s really hard to duplicate that kind of chemistry. Which is why the prequels didn’t work as well -– we weren’t watching Han, Luke and Leia. If we are watching new characters, well, who knows what we’re going to get? Which can be said for any new movie, really. So, I least get what Abrams is thinking here because, for me, ""Star Wars"" is Han, Luke and Leia. Then again, it’s been 30 years since the cast has played these characters and, yes, that’s a concern. Literally not one human being has been officially cast in ""Episode VII"" –- not even Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher; it's to the point that Ford will dodge every question even remotely about Episode VII (I speak from experience) -- even though it seems that almost every living human being is under some sort of consideration. (The latest names thrown around have been Michael Fassbender, Hugo Weaving, Adam Driver and Jesse Plemons from ""Breaking Bad"" -- because, why not?) It’s an odd trichotomy at the Lucasfilm camp these days. What once was solely controlled by George Lucas himself –- with all major decisions coming down from one guy, really -– has now been split into three. There’s Abrams, there’s new Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy, and then there’s the parent company, Disney itself. The system itself is almost designed to create friction, which, yes, can slow down the process. (As we saw when ""Episode VII"" was moved from May 2015 to December 2015.) As I’ve written before, I refuse to freak out about ""Star Wars"" (I’m really trying my best, I swear). Again, the smoothest ""Star Wars"" productions were the three prequels and the most difficult, by far –- which included a complete script rewrite just like ""Episode VII"" -- was ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Today, ""Empire"" is considered the best of the six ""Star Wars"" movies, while even Lucasfilm seems to be trying to bury the prequels in obscurity. And to Abrams’ credit, he seems to want to make an announcement soon, just to get it over with, as he said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Jan. 20, ""I look forward to that so that we can get past it and we can get on with it."" So, the lack of news about ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" means nothing in terms of how that movie will turn out. But it still would be nice to hear something.","What once was solely controlled by George Lucas himself –- with all major decisions coming down from one guy, really -– has now been split into three"

He was my first love and I missed him a lot, but gradually learned to get over him up until I started having wild sexual dreams about him. I would say I’ve had about a handful of these dreams. One dream in particular I would like to have decoded is a dream where we were doing our thing and he whispers in my ear ""I love you, I will never let you go.""

In fact, it is such a significant milestone that he is very likely to show up in your dreams from now on. Before you fall out of your chair, let me explain. The first time we experience love, it’s quite an amazing feeling. It’s bubbly and tingly and delicious! AND we feel sexy because someone totally digs us. Those are powerful feelings, and they become imprinted into our subconscious and the person who first caused those feelings within us forever becomes a symbol for them. So whenever we are in a dry spell — when we aren’t in a relationship or when the relationship we are in has become a bit too routine and hum drum — that first love will pop into our dreams... even decades later! He or she will serve as a reminder that it’s time to spice things up again, to bring that excitement and desire back into our life or back into our current relationship. Let me tell you, it’s been almost 30 years since I was with my first love, and he still makes cameos in my dreams from time to time. But I know it’s not because I want him back or he’s thinking of me; it’s because I need the reminder that I am a passionate person, and I need to kick it up in the romance department with my hubby. Now, your breakup is still pretty new, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are still feelings you are harboring that are at play here. What he tells you in the dream is important, but it is also important to know that these are not his words but rather what you are saying to yourself. Your dream is your inner mind’s creation, so this is all you, not him. But don’t be sad or disappointed. This is your inner conversation with yourself about him and about love. On one level, you are telling yourself that you do not want to let go of what you had. On another level, this is your subconscious telling you that it is not letting go because he is now — and will continue to be — a powerful dream symbol for you. And on the deepest level, this is your wise dreaming mind saying don’t let go of the hope of love. First loves aren’t meant to last. They usher us into the world of romance and teach us what a healthy relationship should or should not be. They help us to develop the skills and gain the knowledge we will need when THE ONE finally comes along. So go ahead and let go of the guy, but do hold on to the lessons that first love has given you. """"Go ahead and let go of the guy, but do hold on to the lessons that first love has given you.""""  """"Go ahead and let go of the guy, but do hold on to the lessons that first love has given you.""""  Hopefully this was helpful to Candy and anyone else who may have had a dream about an ex!

In the Middle Ages, you would be lucky to live to 40, while for many people today, 90 or even 100 isn’t out of the question. But one man not only figured out the secret to a long life, he might have been the oldest person to ever live. And when you hear his story, you’ll be totally captivated! This is Li Ching Yuen. According to a 1930 article from The New York Times, he reportedly lived to be 256 years old... In 1928, professor Wu-Chung Chieh of Chengdu university discovered documentation congratulating Li on his 150th birthday in 1827, and even more documents congratulating him on his 200th birthday in 1877. According to the Times article, the old men in the neighborhood claimed that Li was already a grown man when they were just children. Li began his career as an herbalist at just ten years old, and for almost forty years, had a diet of mostly herbs, goji berries, lingzi, wild ginseng, he shoo wu, gotu kola, and rice wine. He continued this for the next 100 years of his life. At the age of 71, in 1749, he joined the Chinese army as a martial arts instructor. He was a beloved member of his community, and reportedly married 23 times, fathering some 200 children in the process. But supposedly, he wasn’t even the oldest man that he knew! One of his disciples claimed that Li once met a 500-year-old man that taught him Qigong exercises and a special herb-rich diet that can help people live extraordinarily long lives. When asked about the secret to his long life, Li had this to say: ""Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon, and sleep like a dog.""

So just what are they? A report from the red planet, or just a weird little topographical anomaly? Definitely the latter, NASA explains. The dunes have formed in a depressed area that's probably an old asteroid impact crater. The circular depression has had a weird effect on both the amount of sand available to form dunes and the way the winds carve up the dunes, NASA said. So instead of the long, flowing lines of dunes we're used to seeing on our planet, the winds on this part of Mars swirled in such a way to create distinct dots and dashes of dunes.","astronomers have discovered dark sand dunes on Mars that resemble Morse code.

2356,"The game, as Danny Blanchflower said, is about glory. Blanchflower didn't add that his sentiment applies doubly on occasions like a European Cup final, but then it kind of goes without saying. It's unlikely that many of Liverpool's fans, players or coaching staff will have thought about much other than glory since touching down on Swiss soil ahead of Wednesday’s Europa League final against Sevilla. St. Jakob-Park, the venue for the 2016 Europa League Final Certainly, the idea that Liverpool could directly benefit from losing out on the trophy will be seen as heresy within a club that prides itself on its substantial collection of silverware – not least when the trophy comes with the considerable addendum of a ticket to next season’s Champions League, something that would single-handedly salvage a desperately mediocre league campaign. And yet, look closely, and those benefits might just be there, staring everyone in the face. Short-term gains Diego Costa, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Willian are just three targets to have declined employment on Merseyside in favour of rubbing shoulders with the continent's crème de la crème each midweek But first, the common wisdom. Europa League glory, and the resultant promise of Champions League football, would not only boost Liverpool back among Europe’s elite but also provide substantial enticement for any prospective recruits – especially ones of the calibre to elevate also-rans into hard-nosed competitors. Why else would Marco Reus, for instance, join England’s eighth-best team? It's an incentive that’s regularly incensed Liverpool in recent years: Diego Costa, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Willian are just three targets to have declined employment on Merseyside in favour of rubbing shoulders with the continent's crème de la crème each midweek. Willian interested the Reds before Chelsea stole the Brazilian late on Similarly, the cash that would land in Liverpool's coffers from UEFA’s broadcasters and prize money fund (Juventus earned themselves €89m en route to last year’s final) isn’t to be sniffed at. The bigger picture The extra football could certainly harm his players, though. In fact, it already has But while players may be lured to Liverpool by the Champions League, the inverse is also true: the current squad has precisely no in-demand superstars for whom another season outside of the competition would prove too much to bear. In short, while Champions League qualification could help Klopp's squad, a lack of it would not harm it. The extra football could certainly harm his players, though. In fact, it already has – witness the farcical epidemic of injuries that followed the manager’s arrival. The German’s dogged, frenetic playing style can blow opponents away, but it often means collateral damage among his own troops, too. Liverpool's injury chaos is because rigid ‘teacher’ Klopp failed to adapt his approach to the specific circumstances pic.twitter.com/yyNWRAIT7j — Raymond Verheijen (@raymondverheije) 9 January 2016 It's not just rest and recuperation, though, for which a week-long break between fixtures is good for (although when your star man has hamstrings as delicate as Daniel Sturridge's, it certainly plays a part). Klopp has already shown himself to be a dab hand on the training ground – note the sharp upturns in Adam Lallana, Divock Origi and Dejan Lovren since he's arrived – and so to be granted a week of uninterrupted bibs-and-cones work between league games may well see such improvements become steeper still. MORE LIVERPOOL What Adam Lallana’s Liverpool rebirth can teach us about football Klopp's methods depend on his players' ability to comprehend and carry out what is, to use Liam Neeson parlance, a very particular set of skills. His tactical blueprint is arguably more demanding than most, hinging as it does on his players recognising 'pressing triggers', being able to compress space as a unit, and then marauding forward as quickly and as dangerously as possible – all en masse and in sync. Such coordinated strategies can only benefit from training-ground practice. Two years: a long time But in practical terms, Liverpool’s 2013/14 campaign was notable for its near-total lack of commitments beyond league fixtures It’s worth remembering, too, the conditions that brought about Liverpool's last title charge. Yes, there was the elevatory stardust of Luis Suarez, and the gladiatorial presence of a fleetingly revitalised Steven Gerrard. But in practical terms, Liverpool’s 2013/14 campaign was notable for its near-total lack of commitments beyond league fixtures: the previous year's seventh-place finish saw the club limbo underneath the Europa League spots, and Brendan Rodgers' men hot-footed it out of both domestics cups by the fifth round. The glorious goal-blitz with which Liverpool stormed the league over that second half-season (once the cups were done with), led by the free-scoring Suarez-Sturridge-Sterling triumvirate, is often looked back on as a kind of inexplicable, unrepeatable marvel; a team of tyros surfing an intangible tidal wave of exuberance all the way to the final stretch. SAS - or Suarez and Sturridge - powered Liverpool to a title challenge But exuberance, spontaneous as it might appear, comes a lot easier after a full week's training – just ask the current Leicester squad. Claudio Ranieri's men, along with Mauricio Pochettino's and Diego Simeone's, have helped drum home the overriding theme of this season: that the sport’s moneyed giants can be felled by hard-running, high-aggression sides that exceed the sum of their parts. It’s a notion that Klopp, football’s self-styled underdog, fully buys into. That he espouses a similar high-energy, counter-attacking game to the above teams adds weight to the theory that extra hours on the training ground would be of disproportionate value to his side. Ranieri, Simeone and Pochettino have all enjoyed success this season from rivals participation in various competitions Add to the equation the fact that the rebuilding job required by Klopp is not perhaps as colossal as many seem to think: a couple of well-considered embellishments to a squad that already boasts the most elusive of figures – a world-class centre-forward – alongside the continued improvement of what’s already there, and who’s to say a title charge (if that’s all there is to concentrate on) couldn’t be viable with a solid pre-season under the belt? Look long Champions League qualification, while it might lure one or two high-pedigree players, will not suddenly bestow Liverpool with a glut of galacticos; either way, next season’s squad will look rather similar to this season’s. And as this term’s league position shows, spreading resources thinly enough to compete in Europe means results can end up being spread pretty thinly too, with outrage-inducing team selections like Rodgers' perceived surrender in the Bernabeu being the alternative. All this is admittedly academic for now. Liverpool head to Basel fully imbued with Blanchflower’s mantra: glory will be the only thing on their minds, as indeed it should. But painting the result as a pivotal moment in Klopp’s project is at odds with the recent experiences of a club whose best season in years came without the competition, and whose one recent campaign in it was an abject disaster. Klopp will be keen to end the first term of his tenure with a trophy Of course, Liverpool is a club than prides itself on its European trophies. But at its heart is a deep longing for the domestic title – and the strange truth is that missing out on the former could perhaps give them their best shot at the latter.

Police cordoned off a townhouse in Malmo’s Lindängen district after reports of an explosion that they believed to have been a hand grenade. One person has been taken to a local hospital with shrapnel injuries according to the authorities and members of Sweden’s national bomb protection were called to the scene newspaper Afton Bladet reports.

2364,"In 100 Episodes, The A.V. Club examines the shows that made it to that number, considering both how they advanced and reflected the medium and what contributed to their popularity and/or longevity. In this edition, That’s So Raven, which ran for 100 episodes on Disney Channel from 2003 to 2007. Some Hollywood careers are composed of phases so disparate, real mental effort is required to link them together. Such is the case with Raven-Symoné, who has recently enjoyed a high-profile second act as the resident firebomb-thrower on ABC’s The View. Given her tendency to rankle the Twitterverse with rambling pronouncements about ethnic-sounding names, among other hot topics, it’s hard to remember she entered the public eye at 3 years old as the beloved Olivia Kendall on season six of The Cosby Show. Raven occupies rarefied air as one of few next-gen sitcom moppets to earn her place on the show rather than just occupying the requisite precocious kid slot in a family comedy. After landing the Cosby gig, Raven went on to make Olivia the anti-Cousin Oliver. But Raven’s most successful phase is arguably the four years she spent doing That’s So Raven, the Disney Channel kid-com so successful, it made the Disney Channel fundamentally rethink its approach to original programming. Prior to Raven, Disney Channel’s ""65-episode rule""—which almost invariably led to the cancellations of Disney originals once they hit that magic number—was applied to its animated and live-action series alike. The 65-episode model was primarily based on how Disney schedules its programming. With five original episodes each week, a 65-episode run allows new episodes for 13 weeks, allowing Disney to shuffle new properties in and out of rigid, quarterly slots. Even though Disney’s live-action series—like Lizzie McGuire, The Famous Jett Jackson, and the Shia LaBeouf vehicle Even Stevens—premiered new episodes weekly rather than five days a week, Disney canceled all three after the 65th episode, leaving loyal fans frustrated and clamoring for more. But after becoming the highest-rated original in the channel’s history, Raven broke way past the 65-episode barrier, making it Disney’s first series to hit broadcast television’s 100-episode syndication threshold. Its record for longest Disney Channel run has since been surpassed by Wizards Of Waverly Place, but Raven laid the foundation for the latter shows to live longer than it would have had it premiered five years earlier. Raven began life as a pitch from Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman (who retained creator credits) called The Future Is On Me, a similar premise without a specific actress in mind. The title was later changed to Absolutely Psychic, and became That’s So Raven after Raven (as she was billed in the credits) was cast in the lead role. Interestingly, Raven initially auditioned for the role of Chelsea, the lead character’s ditzy best friend, but producers were so impressed with her, they gave her the starring role instead. The role of Chelsea went to Anneliese Van Der Pol, while Orlando Brown was drafted to play Raven’s co-BFF, athletic, girl-crazy Eddie. Raven’s unprecedented success suggests the show did something out of the ordinary. But it hewed to the shopworn premise followed by Sabrina The Teenage Witch and so many other comic-book franchises, in which extraordinary adolescents deal with abilities or circumstances that should theoretically make their lives easier, but usually wind up having the opposite effect. Raven Baxter is a typical high-schooler in every way but one: she has psychic powers. Raven’s prophesies are a closely guarded secret, with only Chelsea, Eddie, Raven’s goony little brother Cory (Kyle Massey), and their parents Victor and Tanya (Rondell Sheridan and T’Keyah Crystal Keymáh) in the know. The show never delves into an origin story for Raven’s powers, and at no point does the character question the origin or grander purpose of her ability. Raven’s visions are not predetermined, and she’s often able to derail them by directly intervening. But she rarely tries to control the power or direct it toward a specific goal. At the show’s starting line, Raven has already accepted that her spontaneous, fleeting, and context-free glimpses of future events are a fact of life, for better or worse. The show’s most powerful supernatural force is the chemistry between Raven, Brown, and, Van Der Pol, whose collaboration even extends to the show’s theme song, which they performed together. The success of a sitcom about a group of friends is often attributed to the real-life friendships between the castmates, and the Raven trio has the kind of natural give-and-take that makes the audience assume the relationships exist off-camera. Indeed, when Brown, Van Der Pol, and Massey joined Raven on The View in September 2015 for a mini-reunion, their chemistry endures, and they spoke openly about maintaining their friendships in the years since the show ended. Raven is at its best when the three characters are sharing a plot, as in season two’s ""A Goat’s Tale,"" in which they conspire to conceal their rival’s barnyard mascot after Eddie kidnaps it, and ""Out Of Control,"" in which Raven has a vision she interprets as evidence of a secret affair between Eddie and Chelsea. The supporting characters in Raven’s family are equally well-cast, especially Massey, who has his own knack for physical comedy and costumed clowning. In another first, Massey and Sheridan went on to star in Cory In The House, Disney’s first spin-off sitcom. House had its own elaborate premise, in which Victor, a professional chef, gets drafted to work in the White House kitchen, and Cory comes to live there with him. The spin-off managed to last two seasons before its ratings petered out leading to its cancellation, but that it made it that far speaks to just how successful Raven was for Disney. In addition to its massive ratings success, Raven was a two-time Emmy nominee, and it became a merchandising powerhouse for Disney. The show inspired dolls, lunch boxes, soundtracks, a fragrance, a clothing line, a long-running novel series, and several video games. It’s a hugely impressive legacy for a children’s show with such a wistful tone. Despite its typically goofy nature and broad, kid-friendly comic sensibility, Raven is surprisingly world-weary compared to its peers. Where similar shows have given their protagonists at least a few episodes to enjoy their unusual situation before piling on the complications, Raven was immediately faced with ethical challenges with regard to using her powers. In episode three, ""Test Of Friendship,"" Raven’s limits are tested when she sees a vision of Eddie getting an F on his Spanish midterm, a grade that would disqualify him from the school basketball team. Raven withholds the information while she considers her next move, and when she confides in Chelsea, she realizes her vision has left her with perfect recall of the test’s answers. As Raven and Chelsea consider whether Raven should help Eddie cheat on the test, she’s already expressing ambivalence about her powers: ""I want you to be the one who’s psychic so I can be the one to say ‘So what are you going to do?’"" Chelsea’s reply: ""So... what are you going to do?"" ""Friendship"" exemplifies the rigid template for a typical Raven episode. Even when Raven’s frustratingly narrow visions lead to standard sitcom fodder like mistaken identities and romantic misunderstandings, there’s usually some kind of moral calculus at play as she grapples with if and when to turn her prophecies to her advantage. The story plays out, as Raven’s misadventures always do, with Raven (and in this case, Chelsea) donning a ridiculous costume and going to some pratfall-friendly extreme to correct her mistake. In this case, that mistake is giving Eddie the answers to the Spanish exam only to learn that the teacher switched it with another test at the last minute. The third act finds Raven trying to alert Eddie to the test swap, which eventually leads to Raven and Chelsea posing as window washers outside Eddie’s classroom. The window-washing basket goes askew, sending Raven and Chelsea swinging, and showing the another glimpse of the show’s most potent weapon: Raven’s talent for physical comedy. Child stars don’t always make convincing, compelling actors once they get older, especially since so much ""precocious kid"" humor comes from the writing more than the performance. But Raven is an incredibly gifted physical comedian, and the show plays to that strength every opportunity it gets. Raven is the closest television has come to a modern-day I Love Lucy, anchored by a truly game actress who will happily take a tumble, cover herself in goo, or some combination of the two if it’ll get a laugh. The moral implications of Raven’s ability are such a strong element of the show that they cancel out the wish fulfillment inherent to the premise. Raven is never allowed to cleanly prosper from her visions, and when she tries to use her visions to gain a leg up, the plan usually backfires. In the season one episode ""Psychics Wanted,"" Raven is recruited to come to work for a fraudulent psychic hotline—a nod to ""Miss Cleo"" and the infamous Psychic Readers Network—and she initially resists before finally relenting, hoping she can use her paycheck to take a crush to a jazz festival. Unexpectedly, the object of Raven’s affection ends up on the line with her, and instead of giving him accurate advice about the jazz scholarship he’s angling for, she tells him what he wants to hear, then tries to steer him into dating her. The plan goes awry, Raven doesn’t get her man, and she is reminded once again that life works best when it unfolds naturally, not supernaturally. Raven, like Lucy before it, was built for longevity. Its character development is non-existent and its plots are repetitive. The biggest shift in its storytelling came in season two, when Victor opened The Chill Grill, a The Max-style teen hangout restaurant that gave Victor a more active role and provided a new interior setting. Raven’s episodes were so interchangeable, they never aired in order of production, or anywhere near it, for the show’s entire run. But while the show’s approach to storytelling made it impervious to age, it was also limited by the high school setting. Any show about high school kids has to figure out how to extend the premise after high school is over, and rather than tackle that issue, Disney ended the show instead. There was also the matter of Keymáh, who left the show after season three because of her dissatisfaction with her character’s direction. Though Tanya’s absence isn’t readily felt, the characters occasionally refer to how she’s in England pursuing higher education, and nothing makes a show feel more dated than dubious explanations for a character’s abrupt absence. But by the time Raven hit its fourth year, it had already changed Disney Channel for the better. By opening the network to the idea of open-ended runs for its shows, it set the stage for such future successes as Hannah Montana. (Saturday Night Live’s ""Disney Channel Acting School"" sketch pays hilarious tribute to Raven’s legacy.) But it wasn’t just a matter of arriving at the right moment. Raven succeeded because it’s one of Disney’s most consistently and durably funny shows, the rare example of a charismatic child actress actually improving once she became a young woman. Who would have seen that coming?","Raven succeeded because it’s one of Disney’s most consistently and durably funny shows, the rare example of a charismatic child actress actually improving once she became a young woman."

2373,"Forget Mr Right and settle for Mr Alright You might think that when presented with a never-ending supply of potential suitors, people would be getting pickier.  After all, with a lot of dating websites like Match and eHarmony, users can specify almost everything they’re looking for in a partner, so why wouldn’t you be choosy? New research has revealed, however, that people are in fact lowering their standards as a result of dating apps and sites. Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology studied data from Australia’s largest dating website RSVP and the dating profiles of over 41,000 people aged between 18 and 80 in a bid to work out whether the rise of online dating has changed people’s habits. They concluded that singletons are disregarding their ‘check-list’ of criteria and pursuing other potential romantic partners who have sufficient acceptable qualities. The reason that online daters are more likely to settle could be that they’re tired of trying to find the perfect person amongst so many. ""We looked at whether or not people actually contact people who match what they say is their ideal partner in their profile, and our findings show they don't. Stating a preference for what you are looking for appears to have little to no bearing on the characteristics of people you actually contact,"" study author Stephen Whyte said. He explains that the nature of online dating is triggering changed in the psychology of humans choosing a mate. ""Disclosure of 'ideal' partner preferences is a widely offered and commonly-used option for people creating a profile on online dating websites, but whether it's effective or useful in helping people find that special someone is unclear,"" Whyte says. ""This study provides quite unique findings in that people may state a preference for an ideal partner but they are more than happy to initiate contact with potential love interests that bear no resemblance whatsoever to that 'Mr or Mrs Perfect' they initially think they prefer over all others."" In today’s busy world, with our seemingly throwaway dating culture, finding a partner takes a lot of time and effort, but the study’s results could be encouraging for people looking for love online. So if you lower your standards, the chances are everyone else has too, so you may just meet the one as a result.",The reason that online daters are more likely to settle could be that they’re tired of trying to find the perfect person amongst so many

I know this is a great thing because I am writing most of this post while traveling on one of Amtrak's Northeast Regional trains between Boston and New York City. I will undoubtedly waste a few minutes checking email and scrolling through Twitter, but most of the minutes I lose will be eaten up by that little spinning circle at the upper left of my Google Chrome tabs. To remedy that and other current Wi-Fi constraints—no streaming video, no large-file downloads—Amtrak announced Monday that it will solicit proposals to build a ""high-capacity, broadband-speed"" Wi-Fi network along its busy Northeast Corridor track. The goal is to increase each train's bandwidth from its current 10 megabits per second to a minimum of 25 Mbps, and eventually as high as 100 Mbps. Before the entire route gets an overhaul, Amtrak will test broadband network options along a section of its Northeast Corridor in Delaware south of Wilmington, said Lenetta McCampbell, senior director of onboard systems. ""Because this hasn't been done in a network like ours, which has very high train traffic and high speed trains, we first want to prove the technology can work,"" she explained.

2394,"The injustice orchestrated by lab chemist Annie Dookhan was first revealed five years ago, after she had been working for the Massachusetts state drug lab for nearly a decade to help prosecutors, in her words, get drug dealers ""off the streets."" Then the lab chemist once called ""superwoman"" for her exceptional speed running tests told state police that she had ""screwed up big-time."" In the year that followed, authorities would call into question the convictions of tens of thousands of drug cases handled by Dookhan in the Massachusetts state drug lab. There was a reason she was so fast, it turned out: She eventually told investigators she tripled the productivity rates of her colleagues by not actually testing all the drugs that came before her, forging her co-workers’ initials and mixing drug samples so that her shoddy analysis matched the results she gave prosecutors. Her motivation, according to her attorney, reflected the overachiever mentality she had exhibited throughout her life: to be ""the hardest working and most prolific and most productive chemist."" But the full consequences of her crimes became clear only this week when prosecutors in eight Boston-area counties announced they would dismiss 21,587 drug cases tainted by Dookhan’s misconduct. On Thursday, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court made those dismissals official. The American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts called it the largest dismissal of convictions in U.S. history. ""Today is a major victory for justice, fairness, and the tens of thousands of people who were wrongfully convicted based on fabricated evidence,"" ACLU executive director Carol Rose said in a statement. It appears Dookhan has remained mum since her own conviction in 2013 for these deceptions, which the Supreme Judicial Court once said ""cast a shadow over the entire criminal justice system."" Her silence is not surprising. Profiles by the Boston Globe and Associated Press from years ago, when Dookhan was first arrested, portray the Trinidad-born immigrant as soft-spoken, work-obsessed and deeply private. She was a go-getter so anxious to please, former friends and colleagues said, that she made a habit of stretching the truth — and sometimes outright lying — to inflate her personal narrative. The turning point, the reports suggest, may have come in 2009, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts that defendants in drug cases have a right to confront the chemists who test the drugs. Chemists, as a result, wound up spending a lot more time in court and a lot less time in their labs. While the productivity of Dookhan’s fellow chemists dropped off, Dookhan’s continued to skyrocket. By the end of 2009, the Globe reported that other chemists had completed an average of 1,981 tests. Dookhan had run 6,321. That year, she also told police she started to ""dry-lab"" to further increase her productivity so she could keep up. Dry-labbing is essentially identifying the drugs as what they were suspected to be. If a sample was returned to her after a retest revealed it wasn’t what she said it was, she would contaminate it so it matched. ""My colleagues call me ‘superwoman’ and say that I do too much for the lab and everyone else, in general,"" Dookhan wrote in an email to an assistant district attorney, reported the Globe. ""I am not a workaholic, but it is just in my nature to assist in any way possible."" At an unassuming 4 feet 11 inches, Dookhan had gotten the nickname ""Little Annie."" But ""Little Annie"" turned out to be a big liar. One of Annie Dookhan’s first known fibs played out on her résumé 20 years ago, according to the Globe, when she claimed she had graduated from her prestigious Boston prep school, Boston Latin Academy, ""magna cum laude."" But that distinction, according to the school, did not exist. She peddled other exaggerations and lies — about her parents’ job titles, her job titles, her salary and divorce proceedings. Most damning though, beyond the tampered drug tests, was the lie she told about advanced degrees she never earned, which ultimately resulted in additional charges. She once swore under oath she earned a master’s degree, which she hadn’t. There was no doubt about her intelligence. Classmates, professors at the University of Massachusetts, bosses and colleagues all attested to that in interviews with the Globe. She would come to work early and leave late, never resting for lunch or snacks and often taking work home with her. ""She wanted to be able to say that she was an accomplished person,"" Anthony Parham, Dookhan’s former supervisor at a vaccine lab where she had previously worked, told the Globe. ""She grew up very isolated, without many people of her background around her,"" said Parham, who is African American. ""I understand what it is like to be a minority in America. I think that experience reinforced her determination to show that she was just as good, or even better."" Dookhan started working for the state drug lab in 2004, and in her first full year on the job tested 9,239 drug samples, three times more than other chemists in the lab. The following year, that number jumped to 11,232, four times the average chemist and nearly double the second-most productive person behind her. The year she started at the state lab, Dookhan married Surrendranath Dookhan, who would years later send frantic text messages to a district attorney his wife had befriended. In them, he told the former assistant Norfolk County district attorney George Papachristos that his chemist wife was ""looking for sympathy and attention."" ""This is Annie’s husband do not believe her, she’s a liar, she’s always lying,"" one text message said. Papachristos later resigned from his district attorney job after news reports of his personal friendship with Dookhan. At work, colleagues began to question the lab’s most unrealistically productive chemist, and in 2010, supervisors conducted a paperwork audit of her work but found no problems, reported the Associated Press. They did not retest her samples. In June 2011, she was suspended from lab duties after she was caught forging a colleague’s initials. It wasn’t until March 2012, after nearly a decade on the job, that Dookhan resigned. That’s when she said ""I screwed up big-time,"" according to a state police report. ""I messed up bad. It’s my fault."" In 2013, Dookhan pleaded guilty to 27 counts of misleading investigators, tampering with evidence and filing false reports. She was sentenced to three years in prison, plus probation. A year ago this month, Dookhan was released. The court has asked prosecutors to decide which cases to retry and which to drop. Meanwhile, authorities in Massachusetts are now dealing with a second major scandal at the Massachusetts state drug lab stemming from the disclosure last year that another chemist, Sonja Farak, was actively stealing and using seized drug samples while analyzing them. She pleaded guilty in 2014. The consequences of Farak’s case are still to be calculated.","She eventually told investigators she tripled the productivity rates of her colleagues by not actually testing all the drugs that came before her, forging her co-workers’ initials and mixing drug samples so that her shoddy analysis matched the results she gave prosecutors"
2395,"Rochelle Safo has spent so long at the digitization belt, she hears it in her dreams: The ""click"" of the camera, the ""beep"" of the computer, the ""whir"" of the belt as it conveys the next specimen beneath the camera's lens. Click. Beep. Whir. Click. Beep. Whir. The sounds fill the windowless room deep in the bowels of the National Museum of Natural History where she works. Eight hours a day, five days a week, every week for the past 16 months, Safo has helped operate a huge conveyor belt designed to digitize the museum's vast botany collection. Deftly, she and her two fellow digitizers place papers bearing pressed plants on the belt, pass them under a camera, snap a photo, check the image on the computer, then replace the sheets in their folder. Click, beep, whir. ""It's definitely not what I had imagined,"" admitted the 24-year-old Safo. She'd gone to Georgetown to get a master's degree in museum studies with the hope of becoming a curator. But when she graduated and started looking for jobs at the Smithsonian, this was what was available. The seemingly monotonous task turned out to be essential. ""There's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes than you think,"" Safo said. ""The fact that we all manage to stay sane is really what makes the museum run."" The NMNH botany collection, or herbarium, is among the largest in the world, filling more than two floors of the museum with massive palm fronds, tiny slides containing microscopic algae, coconuts heavier than a human toddler, pressed plants older than the United States, and objects associated with some of the famous names in the history of science and exploration — Charles Darwin, Captain James Cook, President Theodore Roosevelt. All told, there are more than 5 million specimens spanning the past three centuries of plant life on Earth. Some 3.5 million of those objects are ""press sheets"" — dried and preserved plants mounted on stiff white paper and meticulously labeled with information about when and where they were found. ""It is a record of what existed,"" said Department of Botany chief Laurence J. Dorr. And since 20,000 to 30,000 new specimens are added each year, ""it will stand as a record of what exists today."" But for years, the record was locked away in cabinets, difficult to search and impossible to analyze on large scales. And at the plodding rate of ""traditional digitization"" (in which press sheets are scanned and identifying information is entered into a database by hand), any effort to turn the physical archive into a digital one seemed Sisyphean. New objects were added to the collection so rapidly the museum couldn't keep up. It took 40 years to catalogue the first million and a half items in the herbarium. Then the Digitization Program Office got involved. Next month, the botany staff will notch their next million digitized objects. It took less than a year and a half. ""I go back to the automobile,"" said Ken Rahaim, who oversees mass digitization for the entire Smithsonian. ""We borrowed a lot from Henry Ford, kind of creating a more industrialized process to do the mass digitization that we do here at the scale that we do it at. We're taking specialists and putting them at the tasks they're all most efficient at."" Assembly line techniques aren't all that were required for the mass digitization program. The NMNH project uses a conveyor belt and high-speed camera developed in the Netherlands; it is the biggest project to use the technology in the United States. (The Dutch Naturalis Biodiversity Center employed the technology to digitize 7 million specimens in less than five years.) The project also relies on the efforts of about a dozen transcribers based in Suriname, who enter information from the press sheet labels into the database. Fans of the collection, or people who just enjoy mildly tedious typing, also can pitch in via the museum's online transcription center. Some five dozen people are involved in the process, said Sylvia Stone Orli, digitization manager for the botany department. When the initiative won a museum award last year, so many team members got up to receive it, they barely fit on the stage. This is the reality of working at a natural history museum, Orli said. Even collectors and curators spend most of their time at their desks, archiving and analyzing data. One of Orli's colleagues in invertebrate zoology used to have a series of photos pinned to his door showing pictures of scientists in various swashbuckling situations with captions such as, ""What my friends think I do"" and ""What my mom thinks I do."" The final photo, captioned ""What I actually do,"" shows a woman sitting in front of a computer. ""It's really funny, because museum work — what they're doing on the conveyor belt and what a lot of us do — is just like daily, monotonous things to get the work done,"" Orli said. Rahaim interjected, ""But that's the foundation for the data that generates the information that actually creates the knowledge that makes the breakthrough. ... Any 'eureka' moment comes though a lot of foundational hard work at that level."" Dorr agreed. Digitization, he said, will give researchers access to collections on opposite sides of the world. It will allow scientists to use computer algorithms to simultaneously study more specimens than could ever be examined by hand. He imagines a world in which all museum collections are digitized and posted online, and the entire body of human knowledge about nature is available at the click of a button. ""As we do more and other collections do more, I think we're on the cusp of revolutionizing the questions we can ask about the natural world,"" he said. Already, digitization has answered a more mundane question. Several years ago, the botany department lost track of a press sheet containing a purple fireweed collected in Yellowstone in 1883. The specimen was unremarkable except for the fact that it was collected by President Chester A. Arthur — it was the only object he contributed to the museum. So every few years, someone would wonder where it went. In December 2015, a few months into her gig at the conveyor belt, Safo spotted the delicate preserved flower and beneath it, Arthur's name. ""We see a lot of really cool ones,"" she said, then listed off famous names she'd seen inked onto faded labels: Roland Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This too is part of the appeal of working on the belt. With 920,928 items digitized (as of Tuesday night), Safo and her colleagues have handled more specimens from the herbarium than anyone else in the botany department. It's given them a personal, tactile relationship with the collection, one that feels worth the long hours of tedious work. And it's not always dull. Safo and her fellow digitizers pass the time with music and conversation. They listen to podcasts. They race to see if they can beat past records for most items photographed. On a good day, they are as much like machines as the conveyor belt itself, their hands moving fluidly, each person's movements in perfect synchrony with those of her colleagues. Click. Beep. Whir.

2409,"Two months ago on Tuesday, Britain voted to leave the European Union . The shock was immense; the fallout dramatic. But then summer came. The early turbulence subsided and normality (more or less) returned. Brexit, though, has not yet begun to happen. The government does not know what it wants and is not yet equipped to ask for it. Britain and the EU, it is increasingly clear, are far more intimately enmeshed than the leave camp had claimed. For all the leavers’ assurances, extricating the UK from the bloc, negotiating new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world – and ensuring that Britain’s laws and practices adapt – is a gargantuan undertaking. The referendum result, however, is a political reality. The 52% of leave voters – and the politicians who represented them – expect it to be acted upon. So two months on, where does Brexit stand? The three Brexiteers – (from left) Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox The machinery – and the cost One of the first acts of the new prime minister, Theresa May, was to establish two new ministries : the Department for Exiting the European Union, led by David Davis, and the Department for International Trade, headed by Liam Fox. Neither is yet fully up and running. Worse, a predictable and potentially damaging turf war already appears to be under way between Fox’s ministry and the last of the cabinet’s three Brexiters, Boris Johnson at the Foreign Office. That aside, International Trade has so far secured about 10% of the trade negotiators it needs. (Britain has few skilled personnel because the EU negotiates trade deals for its members. Canada, in contrast, has 300.) Meanwhile, DExEU, as it is known, has hired – mainly from elsewhere in the civil service – 150 of the 250-300 total staff it is expected to employ, and reportedly has yet to move into its permanent home. With the civil service a fifth smaller since 2010, fast-stream recruits are being drafted in, but negotiators, lawyers, economists, regulatory experts and management consultants from the private sector will prove essential. They will not come cheap: experienced senior personnel from the likes of KPMG, PwC, Linklater’s and McKinsey cost up to £5,000 a day, recruitment consultants say , or will be seconded on annual salaries of up to £250,000. Trade talks are rarely quick and don’t come cheap – some estimates put the bill at £5bn and the timetable at 10 years. Some estimates suggest ""full Brexit"" may take 10 years and involve up to 10,000 people, not only in the new and other so-called ""hot"" departments such as foreign, home, environment and business, but across the civil service nationally, at an administrative cost of close to £5bn. Hannah White, Brexit lead at the Institute for Government, claims such figures are ""finger in the wind"" stuff but warns that with all the government has set out to achieve besides Brexit ""there is clearly going to have to be a really, really strong process of prioritisation"". The model – and why it matters The government has not yet decided what trade relationship it wants with the EU. A huge amount hangs on the choice between ""membership of"" and ""access to"" the EU’s single market. One alternative is a free trade agreement with the EU, such as Canada’s recent deal; but this gives Britain only limited access to the single market. Although that may be politically acceptable, it would take longer to agree and could hit the economy harder – especially the all-important services sector; trade deals are invariably much tougher on services than on goods. Recent signs indicate the government may be mulling a deal outside the single market as the only option acceptable to voters. May has spoken of a ""bespoke"" agreement, and ITV’s Robert Peston reckons Whitehall is aiming for a deal based on Canada’s, albeit with ""a bespoke add-on for services"". Before any decision can be made, DExEU has to work out exactly which bits of single market membership – including non-tariff barriers, the common regulations, licences and standards that, for example, give UK banks their ""passport"" to operate across the EU – are most valuable, and what they are worth. The politics – and the timing May’s catchphrase that ""Brexit means Brexit"" may disguise Whitehall’s uncertainty about what Brexit actually means, but it does commit to deliver it – and there are plenty pushing to ensure it does. That constitutes a ""hard"" Brexit: crashing out of the EU and the single market with no economic safety net beyond WTO rules, which would mean costly tariffs. The ""soft"" approach – taking time to negotiate an exit and a preferential trade arrangement – is plainly the government’s favoured course. Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. But there is a persistent rumour that late 2017 or even early 2018 is more likely, partly because it could take Whitehall at least that long to be ready before triggering the two-year exit talks, and partly because Dutch, French and German elections will get in the way. That would mean Britain would not leave the EU until late 2019, which the pro-Brexit camp as well as the EU, which wants Brexit over before the 2019 European elections and the new EU budget in 2020, have said emphaticallyis not desirable. Some observers argue that since the Tory leadership has never been capable of resisting its Eurosceptic wing (of which Davis and Fox – the day-to-day Brexit ministers – are hardcore members), the talks may prove short-lived: a ""hard"" Brexit could happen. Those other negotiations ... Assuming Brexit remains soft, article 50 is just the beginning, covering the essential details of the divorce: who pays the pensions of Britain’s EU staff, where the EU institutions based in Britain end up. As well as the article 50 talks a raft of others must follow, including on Britain’s new trade deal with the EU, which could prove so complicated it requires an interim agreement to tide things over. Then Britain’s full WTO membership must be re-established (which means drawing up a new set of national tariffs, a monumental task, and winning approval from 164 countries), and the 50-plus free trade agreements negotiated by the EU on its members’ behalf renegotiated. It is not clear legally whether the UK can leave the EU, constitutionally speaking, without a vote in parliament. A high court case starts in October Plus, as Charles Grant, of the Centre for European Reform, points out , new deals will be needed on European security, defence, the environment, science and research and, in all probability, Northern Ireland. And that takes no account of the changes needed in UK domestic laws and regulations. Brexit, notes Dominic Cook of Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, is ""the biggest transformational project a UK government has ever undertaken"" not only because of foreign negotiations but ""the inward-facing part: implementing and educating in the UK"". The legal challenges The most immediate obstacle to Brexit is judicial. There is a substantial school of thought which says the government is not constitutionally entitled to pull the trigger on article 50 without the specific approval of parliament. At least seven private actions have been grouped together and will be heard by the high court starting in October in what judges have said is a ""matter of great constitutional importance"", with a decision possible by the end of the year. Separately, cases have been launched in Northern Ireland arguing that Brexit would breach the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a physical border with the Republic of Ireland and undermining the legal basis for the 1998 peace deal. So, while we may be two months in, you might want to get used to the waiting. Brexit may not happen quite yet.",Brexit may not happen quite yet
2411,"In 1985, a joint American-French expedition tracked down one of the biggest prizes in maritime archeology: the 73-year-old wreck of the ""unsinkable"" ocean liner Titanic. Dr. Robert Ballard couldn’t sleep. It was the early morning of September 1, 1985, and the 43-year-old oceanographer was lying in his bunk aboard the research vessel Knoor. Ballard had led the ship to the North Atlantic in search of the long-lost wreck of Titanic, but despite combing the seafloor for more than a week, his team’s camera-outfitted robot had yet to find anything other than miles of sand and sediment. With only a few days left before the mission ended, he was beginning to worry the iconic ""Ship of Dreams"" might never be found.  As Ballard tried to distract himself with a book, the Knoor’s cook appeared and said the on-duty watch team had called for him. Ballard pulled a jumpsuit over his pajamas and dashed to the ship’s control van. When he arrived, his colleagues replayed what had just appeared on their robot’s live video feed of the seafloor. The footage was dim and grainy, but the metal object it showed was unmistakable: one of Titanic’s boilers. Ballard and his crew erupted with cheers and applause. Someone opened a bottle of champagne for a toast, but the mood suddenly darkened after they noticed that it was nearly 2:20 a.m.—the exact time the ocean liner had sunk and taken more than 1,500 passengers and crew to their deaths. The thought of it hit Ballard like a shock. ""We were embarrassed we were celebrating,"" he later told 60 Minutes. ""And all of a sudden we realized that we should not be dancing on someone’s grave."" More than 73 years had passed since Titanic left on its doomed maiden voyage to New York. After the liner sank, would-be treasure hunters had proposed using everything from electromagnets to nylon balloons to raise it from the depths. The only problem was that no one knew where it was. Titanic had continued to drift after last reporting its location in a distress call, leaving explorers with a search area that spanned hundreds of miles. Several missions had set off to look for its watery grave. All of them—including a 1977 expedition led by Ballard—had come home empty handed.  Ballard’s second search attempt had been in the works since the early 1980s, when he asked the U.S. Navy to fund the development of the Argo, an unmanned camera sled that could be towed behind a surface ship at depths of up to 20,000 feet. The Navy balked at footing the bill for a Titanic search, but they were interested in using Ballard’s new robot to survey the wrecks of the U.S.S. Thresher and Scorpion, two nuclear submarines that had been lost in the Atlantic in the 1960s. The two parties eventually came to a compromise: if Ballard could successfully locate and map the two sunken subs, he could use whatever time he had left to look for Titanic. Since the United States was still embroiled in the Cold War, the operation was kept top-secret. Ballard was given special instructions and put on active duty as a Naval officer, but as far as the rest of the world was concerned, he was simply an oceanographer on a search for Titanic. It wasn’t until the 2000s that the mission’s military agenda was fully declassified.  Ballard began his clandestine expedition by photographing Thresher in the summer of 1984. The following year, he and a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution returned to the Atlantic and tracked down the wreck of Scorpion off the coast of the Azores. Ballard knew the Navy mission would leave him with precious little time to seek out Titanic, so he asked the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea, or IFREMER, to partner with him. In July 1985, the French research vessel Le Suroit began scouting the area where Titanic was believed to have sunk. Using a technique known as ""mowing the lawn,"" expedition leader Jean-Louis Michel towed a side-scan sonar system back and forth across the search zone in the hope of detecting large metal objects on the seafloor. Despite trawling the Atlantic for five weeks, the sonar failed to uncover any promising leads. The job of finding Titanic fell to Ballard and the crew of Knoor, who had just wrapped up their survey of Scorpion.  Ballard’s military project left him with just 12 days to look for Titanic, but it had also given him an idea for a new search technique. While photographing Thresher and Scorpion, he’d noticed that the current had carried small bits of wreckage from the ships as they fell to the seafloor, creating a long chain of debris. With this in mind, he decided not to search for Titanic’s hull. Instead, he would use Argo to scour the bottom for its much larger debris trail, which might stretch as far as a mile. Once he found it, he could use it to track down the ship itself.  The new approach allowed Ballard to expand the search area and move through it in a much wider pattern. Rather than ""mowing the lawn"" with sonar, he dragged Argo along the seafloor and monitored the live video feed from its onboard cameras. Seven people were needed to keep the submarine and Knoor in synch and analyze all the data, and the crew worked in shifts to keep the watch going around the clock. After several grueling days, they were rewarded with the sight of riveted hull plates and the telltale boiler. Argo continued stalking the debris trail, and the following morning, Titanic’s bow came looming out of the inky depths.  For Ballard, the discovery came with mixed emotions. ""It was one thing to have won—to have found the ship,"" he later wrote. ""It was another thing to be there. That was the spooky part. I could see the Titanic as she slipped nose first into the glassy water. Around me were the ghostly shapes of the lifeboats and the piercing shouts and screams of people freezing to death in the water."" As many had long suspected, Titanic had broken in two as it sank to the bottom. Its bow sat upright and was still surprisingly intact. The more heavily damaged stern lay some 400 meters away.  Ballard and his crew scrambled to document the wreck with both Argo and Angus, another unmanned submarine designed to take still photographs. The shots revealed large sections of Titanic’s hull and mast, including the crow’s nest where the fatal iceberg had first been spotted. Several of the hatches had been torn off, and a missing skylight allowed a tantalizing glimpse down into where the ship’s ""grand staircase"" had once been located. The large debris field included pristine china plates, pieces of furniture and even an unopened case of champagne. Sea scavengers had long since consumed any human remains. The only remnants of the victims were the many pairs of leather shoes still lying on the sandy bottom.  Just four days after they laid eyes on Titanic, stormy weather forced the crew to pack up their supplies and steer Knoor toward home. Dozens of scientists would later study the site more thoroughly, including Ballard, who returned the following summer to get a firsthand glimpse of the wreck from inside a manned submersible called Alvin. In the meantime, photos of the momentous discovery were splashed on the front pages of newspapers across the globe, and an army of reporters and television cameras greeted Knoor when it docked in Massachusetts. Ballard, who would later become a fierce opponent of attempts to salvage artifacts from Titanic, used his first press conference to stress the need for the wreck to be treated with reverence. ""The Titanic lies now in 13,000 feet of water on a gently sloping alpine-like countryside overlooking a small canyon below,"" he said. ""There is no light at this great depth and little life can be found. It is a quiet and peaceful place—and a fitting place for the remains of this greatest of sea tragedies to rest. Forever may it remain that way.""","he would use Argo to scour the bottom for its much larger debris trail, which might stretch as far as a mile. Once he found it, he could use it to track down the ship itself."

2417,"Every week, Captain James T Kirk and the crew of the USS Enterprise travelled to distant planets, crossing paths with alien life forms, making new discoveries as they went. While that was a science fiction, the latest discovery by the Belgian telescope TRAPPIST and NASA’s Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescopes is science fact. A group of seven earth-size rocky planets, orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star, named the TRAPPIST-1 system is probably the most important space find of recent times. In May 2016, TRAPPIST had discovered three planets in the system. Later, the Spitzer telescope discovered that the third planet was, in fact, three different planets and it also found two more in addition. What makes TRAPPIST-1 special? The TRAPPIST-1 system is of particular interest to scientists because this is the first time that Earth-size planets have been found orbiting this kind of a star. Observations made so far have confirmed that these are rocky in nature, just like the inner planets of our solar system. The stars orbit is very near to their star, in fact all of them are closer to it than Mercury is to our very own sun. Interestingly, since the star is an ultra-cool dwarf, there’s a good chance of liquid water existing on the surface of the planets, despite the close orbit. Even more important is the fact that three out of the seven are located in the habitable zone. This means three times the chances of alien life existing there. But does it? Nobody is certain about it. Not yet. Water is a pre-requisite for life to exist, so there’s a good chance it might evolve in the future. The habitable zone is that region around a star, where temperatures aren’t really too high or too cold, but just right so liquid water can exist. The earth orbits in the habitable zone and here we are - all alone in the universe. To be certain, however, NASA is going to utilise the James Webb Space Telescope to detect the chemicals that exist there, including water, oxygen, ozone, methane and others. So how earth-like are they? All the seven planets in the system are between 0.77 to 1.09 times the radius of the earth, so they’re pretty much as big as the earth. But since they are so close to their star, if you were there, you’d be celebrating your birthday every 1.5 to 20 earth days! But NASA says that the planets may be tidally locked to the star – which means that one side of the planet is perpetually facing the star and the other has permanent night. So, there may be huge temperature extremes and weather patterns that are completely different from earth. What is the planet surface like? The TRAPPIST-1 system is a relatively close - 40 light years away from us - in the Aquarius constellation and since we’re still struggling to leave our home planet, we can only guess. Visitors to the planet will see a dim red star on the horizon and the sister planets crossing the sky depending on the time of the year there. Also, interplanetary travel in the system will be measured in days and not months and years like it is in our solar system. Hopefully one day, we’ll be able to visit the TRAPPIST-1 system and see it with our own eyes.",The TRAPPIST-1 system is of particular interest to scientists because this is the first time that Earth-size planets have been found orbiting this kind of a star

2421,"A giant gas cloud is set to spiral into the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's core in the next few months, and scientists should get a great view of the dramatic celestial action. NASA's Swift satellite will have a front-row seat for the enormous gas cloud collision, and astronomers can barely contain their excitement. ""Everyone wants to see the event happening because it's so rare,"" Nathalie Degenaar, of the University of Michigan, said in a statement. [Milky Way's Black Hole Eats Gas Cloud (Images)] Collision coming In 2003, scientists discovered what seemed to be a cloud of gas, termed G2, which should collide in March or thereabouts with the supermassive black hole that lurks at the heart of the Milky Way. The interaction will reveal much about this black hole, which is known as Sagittarius A* (or Sag A* for short). Although scientists have observed signs of such feeding in other galaxies, it's rare to see these events so close to home. With their enormous gravitational pull, the centers of black holes trap even light, making them difficult to see. But the edges of these odd objects light up up when they feed, emitting energy that can reveal details about black-hole dynamics. Sag A* is dim even for a class of object known to be challenging to observe —almost 4,000 times fainter than astronomers expect it to be. Every 5 to 10 days, the hungry black hole gobbles down a bit of gas or dust that creates an X-ray flare that telescopes like Swift can capture. For the last eight years, Degenaar and her team have used Swift to observe the galactic center for 17 minutes a day. On the whole, it’s been fairly quiet. ""Our supermassive black hole is laying low,"" Degenaar told reporters earlier this month. ""It’s not displaying a lot of action at all."" That may well change when G2 crashes into Sag A*, since the interaction could create an X-ray flare brighter than those generated by smaller objects. Degenaar’s team, still monitoring Sag A* every day, will be in a perfect position to observe the changes, and other instruments will try to get a good look as well. ""Observatories all over the world, space- and ground-based, are ready for this,"" Degenaar said. A hidden star While many astronomers describe G2 as a large cloud about a dozen times more massive than Earth, it could also be a smaller cloud hiding a star at its center, researchers say. For example, the cloud could contain a variable star known as a T Tauri. But the star would likely be too faint for astronomers to detect. ""You [could] have a windy star plowing through the interstellar medium,"" Leo Meyer of UCLA told reporters earlier this month. It's also possible that G2 contains a protoplanetary disk disrupted by tidal forces. The building of planets so close to the galactic center could inform theories of planet formation. However, such a source should have brightened more than scientists have observed. A third option involves the product of a merged binary. At this point, astronomers aren't sure which is the likeliest scenario. ""There is no smoking gun measurement that clearly tells us whether it is this or that,"" Meyer said. Fireworks or dud? When G2 gets within about 200 astronomical units of Sag A*, it should start to feel strong gravitational effects. (One astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the sun — about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers). But how dramatic those effects will be is still up in the air. ""The biggest question probably is, Will there be fireworks or not?"" Meyer said. ""We still don’t know."" ""Fireworks"" would involve the black hole brightening considerably as a significant amount of mass is dumped into it. Though he hopes for it, Meyer thinks an explosive show is unlikely. But even if the fireworks don't materialize, he doesn’t think the focus on the galactic center will be a loss. The resulting data should still reveal some information about the workings of Sag A*. And the last few years have produced a spike in theoretical discussions on how black holes interact with incoming material. ""Even if nothing happens, this has triggered a whole lot of thinking,"" Meyer said.",A giant gas cloud is set to spiral into the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's core

2423,"President Barack Obama’s parole-style board has approved the repatriation of an al-Qaeda-linked Saudi bomb-maker — held at the U.S. military detention center in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — who authorities believe may re-engage in terrorism against the United States. The Gitmo detainee has been identified as Jabran Qahtani, 39. In March 2002, he was detained in Pakistan where he received explosives training from al-Qaeda. By August of that year, he had been transferred to the Guantánamo facility, also known as Gitmo. Qahtani had traveled to Pakistan from his home country to Afghanistan at the beginning of the war in October 2001 with the intention of fighting U.S.-led coalition troops. In its final determination, Obama’s multi-agency Periodic Review Board (PRB) argues that ""the risk the detainee presents can be adequately mitigated by transfer for prosecution and rehabilitation in Saudi Arabia."" It adds: The Board noted... the detainee’s expressed regret and commitment to not repeat his past mistakes, the detainee’s family commitment to support the detainee upon transfer, and the detainee’s recent positive change in behavior and mindset while detention. The Board acknowledges the detainee’s past terrorist-activities and connections, specifically the detainee’s admission of support for the Taliban, association with two [al-Qaeda] leaders, and his training in building electronic boards. Meanwhile, the PRB declared al-Qaeda-linked Yemeni Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, 47, a ""forever prisoner"" on November 21, the same day that it decided to approve Qahtani for release. Abdullah, also known as Said Salih Said Nashir, traveled to Afghanistan in June 2001 where he trained with al-Qaeda. He was arrested in Pakistan in September 2002 and taken to Gitmo the following month. Some detainees who had been previously designated too dangerous to release — ""forever prisoners"" — have been liberated by the Obama administration. The recent decisions come as outgoing President Obama has stepped up PRB reviews in his quest to keep his campaign promise of shutting down the Guantánamo prison. Abdullah (Nashir) is expected to get another hearing on December 8. A U.S. intelligence profile of Qahtani, dated March 4, notes that he received an electrical engineering degree from King Saud University in the Saudi capital of Riyadh. It adds: He received abbreviated weapons training at an [al-Qaeda] camp in Afghanistan and was selected by a senior [al-Qaeda] military commander to receive explosives detonator training in Faisalabad, Pakistan ... His education and training also make [Qahtani] a skilled bomb maker, however, whose electronics expertise would be in high demand by terrorist organizations. Should [Qahtani] return to Saudi Arabia, we assess that he would seek out prior associates who could provide him a path to reengage in hostilities and extremism, if he chose to do so. Nevertheless, he was approved for repatriation on November 21 by Obama’s board. The PRB points out: In making this determination, the Board considered the detainee’s credible desire to participate in the Saudi rehabilitation program and reintegrate into society, the detainee’s willingness to submit authority of the Saudi Government, the Board’s confidence in the efficacy of the Saudi rehabilitation program, and Saudi Arabia’s ability to implement security assurances after completion of the program. Citing a January 2009 report from the U.S. military’s Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), the U.S. intelligence profile reveals that the Saudi terrorist expressed his support for the Taliban, al-Qaeda’s ally, early in his detention at Gitmo. He ""repeatedly stated that he intended to rejoin the extremist fight against the US and its allies,"" notes the profile. The Obama administration disclosed the PRB’s dual decision regarding the release of Qahtani and indefinite detention of Abdullah on Tuesday. Currently, 60 captives are being held at Gitmo. Following the recent decision, the number of detainees approved for release by Obama’s board reached 21, and the number of ""forever prisoners"" increased to 29. The remaining 10 Gitmo detainees ""are in war crimes proceedings at military commissions, six of them death-penalty tribunals,"" reports the Miami Herald. U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has to approve security arrangements after providing 30 days notice to Congress for each prisoner that is to be released, which means some of them may not be liberated by President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day on January 20, 2017. Nevertheless, the Miami Herald, citing an unnamed U.S. official with knowledge of the transfer process, reported last month that the Obama administration is currently not providing 30-day transfer notices to Congress as mandated by law. Trump campaigned on a promise to keep Gitmo open and ""load it up with some bad dudes.""",Gitmo Board Approves Release of Al-Qaeda Bomb Maker
2424,"It was an audacious nighttime escape. After busting through an enclosure, the nimble contortionist appears to have quietly crossed the floor, slithered through a narrow drain hole about six inches in diameter and jumped into the sea. Then he disappeared. This was no Houdini, but rather a common New Zealand octopus called Inky, about the size of a soccer ball. The breakout at the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, which has captured the imagination of New Zealanders and made headlines around the world, apparently began when Inky slipped through a small gap at the top of his tank. Octopus tracks suggest he then scampered eight feet across the floor and slid down a 164-foot-long drainpipe that dropped him into Hawke’s Bay, on the east coast of North Island, according to reports in New Zealand’s news media. The aquarium’s keepers noticed the escape when they came to work and discovered that Inky was not in his tank. A less independence-minded octopus, Blotchy, remained behind. The aquarium’s manager, Rob Yarrall, told Radio New Zealand that employees had searched the aquarium’s pipes after discovering Inky’s trail, to no avail. The escape happened several months ago, but it only recently came to light. ""He managed to make his way to one of the drain holes that go back to the ocean, and off he went,"" Mr. Yarrall said. ""Didn’t even leave us a message."" Inky’s escape surprised few in the world of marine biology, where octopuses are known for their strength, dexterity and intelligence. Alix Harvey, an aquarist at the Marine Biological Association in England, noted that octopuses, members of a class of marine animals including squid and cuttlefish called Cephalopoda, have shown themselves to be adept at escaping through spaces as small as a coin, constrained only by their beaks, the only inflexible part of their bodies. Ms. Harvey said that octopuses had also been documented opening jars and sneaking through tiny holes on boats, and that they could deflect predators by spraying an ink that lingers in the water and acts as a decoy. Some have been seen hauling coconut shells to build underwater shelters. ""Octopuses are fantastic escape artists,"" she said. ""They are programmed to hunt prey at night and have a natural inclination to move around at night."" She continued, ""They have a complex brain, have excellent eyesight, and research suggests they have an ability to learn and form mental maps."" Ms. Harvey recalled one octopus at a British aquarium that escaped nightly from his tank, slithered to a nearby tank to snack on fish for dinner, and went home. Octopuses’ intelligence, she said, was partly an evolutionary response to their habitation in complex environments such as coral reefs, in which the animals need to hide from predators and sneak up on their prey. Inky is not the first octopus to attract the spotlight. In the summer of 2010, Paul, an octopus in Germany, gained worldwide attention when he appeared to correctly pick the winning team in all seven of Germany’s games at the World Cup in South Africa — a feat that inspired a song. He has been immortalized in Oberhausen, Germany, with a six-foot plastic replica of him clutching a soccer ball.","busting through an enclosure, the nimble contortionist appears to have quietly crossed the floor, slithered through a narrow drain hole"
2428,"""I recently heard that carbonated water leaches calcium from bones, erodes tooth enamel, and even causes cellulite. Is that true? If it’s okay to drink, what are the differences among various fizzy waters?"" recommend drinking Vichy water, notable for its sodium bicarbonate content, as a digestif. Carbonated water is water in which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved, thus creating tiny bubbles. It’s what gives soft drinks their almost irresistible effervescence, but its allure is thousands of years old. Julius Caesar, for instance, had a spa built around the naturally carbonated springs of Vichy, in France, and to this day, balneologists (not your run-of-the-mill therapeutic specialistsrecommend drinking Vichy water, notable for its sodium bicarbonate content, as a digestif. Artificially carbonated water was invented by chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), who published his findings in a 1772 paper titled ""Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air."" He’s most famously known, by the way, as the scientist who identified the gas oxygen, and as luck would have it, this coming Sunday is Oxygen Day at the Joseph Priestley House, in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. I can only wonder what Priestley, one of the world’s great free-thinkers, would make of the current nonsense about the alleged harmful effects of carbonated water. The rumors about sparkling water being bad for you likely stem from misheard, misunderstood, and/or poorly reported findings from studies such as one published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in May 1994. It found an association between cola consumption and bone fractures in 14-year-old girls, but no association between non-cola soft drinks and bone fractures was found. Among subsequent studies that correlated soft-drink consumption (in particular, colas) with the risk of lower bone mineral density (BMD) was the much larger Framingham Osteoporosis Study , which showed that women (but not men) who drink more than three colas a week have a greater risk of low BMD (no matter how old they are or what their calcium intake is) than women who don’t drink cola. ""Regular intake of cola, but not of noncola carbonated beverages [italics mine], may contribute to lower BMD in women,"" the researchers conclude. ""No evidence exists that occasional use of carbonated beverages, including cola, is detrimental to bone."" Carbonation and dental health Carbonation results in the formation of carbonic acid, which gives plain carbonated water its distinctive flavor, but neither carbonation nor carbonic acid seem to have a significant effect on tooth enamel erosion. According to a 2001 study published in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation, ""sparkling mineral waters showed slightly greater dissolution than still waters, but levels remained low and were of the order of one hundred times less than the comparator soft drinks."" If you’re swilling multiple sugary, acidic colas every day, you’re going to have eroded tooth enamel, cavities, and a whopping dentist’s bill, but don’t fault the carbonation in sparkling water, it's not bad for you. Carbonation and cellulite Cellulite is what happens when fat cells push against the connective tissue beneath your skin. Your age, genetic make-up, and thickness of your skin all factor into whether you will develop cellulite and, if so, how much you have. If you're still thinking sparkling water is bad for you, it's not, and it doesn't result in cellulite. What will contribute to cellulite is the inevitable weight you’ll put on if you drink too many sugary sodas. Is sparkling water bad for you? The takeaway Carbonated water has no calories, no dissolved sugar, no alcohol, and no caffeine. It hydrates, just like plain water does. Drinking seltzer, club soda, or sparkling mineral water will not leach calcium from your bones, strip the enamel off your teeth, or make your thighs look like cottage cheese. Unless you have a medical condition that specifically precludes drinking carbonated beverages, enjoy it if so inclined. And if the thought of buying yet more stuff in plastic bottles or metal cans makes you nuts, think about getting one of those home carbonation gizmos like the SodaStream. If I had the counter space, I’d buy one in a New York minute. (And no, I’m not on the company’s payroll.) One last thing: Several people have asked me about Kangen and other ionized waters. That’s a topic for another day, so watch this space. Sparkling Water Glossary Seltzer is the American version (circa 1810) of the naturally carbonated mineral water called Selters, from Germany. By the late 19th century, most American bottlers stopped including minerals and simply added carbonation to filtered tap water, which is what you get today. Particularly around New York City, seltzer is often referred to as ""soda water."" Fun fact: According to The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, seltzer used to be called Belchwasser in German or greps-wasser in Yiddish because of the way it aids digestion. Club soda is also regular water to which carbon dioxide has been added, but it also contains added minerals such as potassium bicarbonate or potassium sulfate (they add a slight minerally flavor) and sodium. Club soda and seltzer can be used interchangeably in drinks. Mineral waters come from underground springs and contain naturally occurring minerals. Unlike a still, or flat, mineral water like Evian, sparkling mineral waters such as San Pellegrino and Perrier come from naturally carbonated springs. Tonic water is carbonated water that contains quinine, which comes from the bark of the South American cinchona tree (aka ""fever tree"") and was the first effective protection against malaria. Present-day tonic waters contain less quinine and their bitterness is balanced with sugar or (sigh) high-fructose corn syrup as well as proprietary botanical blends that may include citrus zests, lemongrass, and/or spices.

2432,"When you’re stuck in the wilderness, you’ve got to learn how to do things you wouldn’t ordinarily have to. Making a fire is probably first and foremost among those tasks, and there are several well-known ways to do so – but you’ve most likely never heard of this method before. In the incredibly popular YouTube video below, user NorthSurvival showcases a trick using a lemon, of all things, to start a fire. Now, it’s clear that the likelihood of having nothing but a lemon and several pieces of copper, zinc, electric wire and steel wool to start a fire with ing the wilderness is essentially nonexistent. But rather than a survival tip, this definitely makes for a fun experiment – as long as you exercise caution. NorthSurvival’s video shows how inserting copper clips and zinc nails into a softened lemon, then connecting the clips and nails with wiring, can produce a short-circuit which will then start a fire, with the help of steel wool and kindling. If this feels reminiscent to a certain grade school science project, it should. The process used to start a fire with a lemon is essentially the same as the one that involves using a lemon to conduct electricity and power a light bulb or a battery. Bright Hub Engineering explains this is due to the copper and zinc creating a breakdown in the atomic structure of the electrodes within both metals and the lemon simultaneously, leading to the generation of a new flow of electrons in the lemon. Be careful: If you attempt this trick yourself, it is important that you use covered wiring like NorthSurvival does in the video – rubber gloves, even, to be safe – in order to avoid electrocuting yourself. Because that’s really the last thing you need to be doing in the wild.","inserting copper clips and zinc nails into a softened lemon, then connecting the clips and nails with wiring, can produce a short-circuit which will then start a fire, with the help of steel wool and kindling."

2442,"iStock Today's at-home chefs are more likely to cook with an iPhone instead of a recipe book. They're more likely to draw their inspirations from a Facebook video. And they're more likely to post a photo of what they cook on Instagram or Pinterest. One other big change: They're more likely to be men. A higher proportion of American men — 43 percent — are cooking these days than at any point in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, they're spending more time than ever before — 49 minutes a day — doing so. Those are up from 38 percent and 40 minutes two decades ago. By contrast, 70 percent of women cook these days, a bump from the 67 percent that cooked two decades ago but a definite decline from the 88 percent of women who cooked 40 years ago. And they're spending 71 minutes a day cooking, also a small increase from 20 years ago but less than the 101 minutes they spent 40 years ago. You can see these trends in the following two charts, which come from a 2013 study by researchers at the University of North Carolina who used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ American Time Use Survey. What's driving the trends? The higher level of cooking overall among men and women may be driven by an era of stagnant wages that makes cooking at home the more affordable option, as well as the fact that broad Internet access and the popularity of social media make it more fun and easier to do than perhaps ever before. While women are cooking at about the same rates they have been for several decades, it's the surge in men's cooking at home that may be most noticeable. Companies that make money off food are weighing how to take advantage of the trend, deciding whether to treat cooking as a distinctly masculine activity or to show foodie-ism as a gender-neutral hobby. Those that invoke a manly-man approach to cooking sometimes hawk bacon, burgers and brews, or else emphasize a testosterone-drizzled palate that helps craft a chiseled bod. Kevin Curry, founder of the blog Fit Men Cook, said men in the kitchen are following what men had been doing since the beginning of humanity: hunting and providing food for themselves and their families. ""It’s a masculine quality to want to physically put food on the table and make it taste good,"" Curry said. The success of Curry’s blog alone suggests just how big the male cooking market is. Founded on Tumblr in 2012, it’s now a profitable website with a Facebook following of a quarter-million users. ""The first thing we do as men is make everything a competition,"" Curry said. ""When we get a new car, we’ll say to our friends, ‘Hey man, look at the rims on this.’ Same with food, we’ll post on Facebook like, ‘Look what I just made, this is bad y’all, I can’t believe it.’ It creates this competitive culture, and as men, we gravitate towards that."" The most pervasive trend is reality competition cooking shows, which have taken the Food Network by storm. The number of food competition shows on the Food Network increased from two in 2005 to 16 in 2014, according to Quartz. These shows try to demonstrate that cooking is ""not for sissies,"" said Daphne Kasriel Alexander, ‎a consumer trends consultant at ‎Euromonitor International. That can help explain the popularity of expletive-spewing male chefs like Gordon Ramsay, whose abrasive personality alone has become a meme. ""That's an example of brands responding to this interest,"" Alexander said. Young men are particularly attracted to these shows, said Deirdre O'Hearn, senior vice president of programming and development at the Food Network and Cooking Channel. O’Hearn said millennial men were interested in personality-driven shows, such as the popular series with Alton Brown. ""These shows appeal to men because we are competitive by nature, coupled with the fact that we ‘see ourselves’ since a majority of the contestants are male,"" Curry said. Other companies distance themselves from gender norms, even doing away with them entirely by casting men and women as having shared family roles. Matt Salzberg, founder and chief executive of meal-kit company Blue Apron, said his company attracts people because of the growing interest in good food and the experience of cooking. Instead of reinforcing gender roles, Blue Apron sends the message that cooking at home can strengthen relationships. ""Now that more women are not the primary caretakers of the home, families are more collaborative with household chores,"" Salzberg said. ""There's a lot of opportunity for men to cook as well. It’s enabling a whole new generation of folks to get into the kitchen."" Home cook Mark Dang, a 30-something biotech employee in San Diego, said cooking has become increasingly gender-less. ""Guys my age are more inclined to step foot in the kitchen thanks to gender equality and division of household responsibilities,"" Dang said. ""Both genders work, so cooking is not a default chore for women."" The charts below demonstrate how much millennial cooking men and women say they do at home. While men are more likely to say they don't cook, the genders are equally likely to claim responsibility for most or all of the home's meal preparation. Experts say food companies are seeking to entice men by invoking the foodie trend — those folks that seek new eating experiences at food trucks and farm-to-table or pop-up restaurants and post their tastiest meals on Instagram. Alexander of Euromonitor suggested that young men are cooking more as millennials tend to be less bound within gender norms. ""Among millennials, gender roles are less fixed,"" Alexander said. ""It doesn't seem so shocking to hear that men are cooking.""","The higher level of cooking overall among men and women may be driven by an era of stagnant wages that makes cooking at home the more affordable option, as well as the fact that broad Internet access and the popularity of social media make it more fun and easier to do than perhaps ever before"

A new study suggests that Neanderthals consumed way more vegetables than scientists once thought -- and the evidence for that finding came from a pretty unexpected place: ancient poop. Or, more specifically, traces of Neanderthal feces taken from a Spanish cave.

""This species is traditionally pictured as highly carnivorous."" A view of El Salt archeological site, where the poop samples were found in sediment. For the study, Sistiaga and her colleagues at MIT and the University of La Laguna in Tenerife, Spain did a microscopic analysis of five sediment samples with remnants of the 50,000-year-old poop. The scientists searched for biomarkers known to be evidence of consumption of either meat or plants. ""Human fecal biomarkers are metabolic products of digestion and they provide invaluable information about relative proportions of animal and plant intake,"" Sistiaga said in the email. What did the analysis show? The biomarkers indicated that, yes, Neanderthals ate a lot of meat but they consumed lots of vegetables too. Previous research showed that Neanderthals ate their greens, but those studies were based on clues found in fossilized teeth. This new study was published in the journal Plos One on June 25, 2014.",Neanderthals consumed way more vegetables than scientists once thought
2457,"Oh my. I’ll never look at my Chinese leftovers in the same way again. At least I know where it goes, after it’s consumed. In China, however, there are literally tons of leftover sweet and sour pork, dumplings, spring rolls, won ton soup and moo goo gai pan. This bounty of leftover slop has been turned into a variety of other cash crops by Chinese restaurant owners who have perfected their recycling skills with an entrepreneurial flare. The Epoch Times reports: ""... North News in China’s Inner Mongolia region reported that of 200 to 300 tons of kitchen slop produced in the 3 million-strong city of Hohhot, only about 60 tons were being legally repurposed to produce aviation fuel. It is feared that the rest is reused in products that end up on dinner plates—in pork feed and cooking oil. Although Hohhot has a municipal environmental company that takes restaurant slop free of charge to be processed, many establishments have found it more profitable to sell the fetid wastewater and leftovers to local collectors and redistributors."" I have an understanding of recycling, [because] a family member used to sell used automobile parts. We called him a dealer in secondary industrial raw materials. Radios, tires, transmissions, mufflers, car seats and any part someone wanted was available. That is, if they had their own wrench. But the idea of being a collector of ""fetid wastewater"" brings a new meaning to environmental dynamics. This mess of recycled pottage is also fed to the pigs and to humans who eat them ""According to North News, slop not given up to the state environmental companies may be resold to pig farms and used as cheap fodder, or reprocessed into common cooking oil for unsuspecting consumers. Leaving aside squeamishness at eating other people’s half-eaten leftovers, restaurant slop often contains non-food substances like kitchen detergent. Slop is also dangerous when used as pig fodder, as it contains significant traces of aluminum and lead, in addition to being laden with bacteria, the Henan Business daily reported. The pork itself also poses a risk."" Some of this putrid mess is sold to private buyers – sounding vaguely familiar to Big Pharma’s vaccine concoctions The Epoch Times reports: ""‘It’s unknown how much of Hohhot’s kitchen slop is recycled in this manner, but the business is profitable, said Fu Ming, head of the municipal environmental company, in an interview with North News. Restaurants can make enough money to pay multiple employees with the food garbage,"" he said. ""‘On an everyday basis, there are a hundred vehicles used to transport slop,’ Fu said, ‘and because restaurants don’t adhere to environmental standards, it is sold to private buyers.'""

The Epoch Times did a story on that too: ""In China, disposable eating utensils, plastic wrap, bags and even synthetic fibers used in clothing can be produced from recycled materials—but those materials don’t come from the best of sources. ""Without proper regulation, syringes, infusion tubes and the like, often tainted with blood and drug residue, are retrieved in bulk and recycled for plastic products... as it may contain traces of infectious diseases, viruses and chemical or radiological pollutants.

2459,"There are few dishes as satisfying as a steaming plate of pasta, especially when it’s enjoyed at the end of a long day. But in addition to the strands of spaghetti or twists of tortellini, there’s another component vital to pasta night—and that’s the sauce. A noodle is nothing without a sauce to cling to (when’s the last time you sat down to a plate of plain pasta?), which is why it’s important to leverage the pasta’s natural starchiness, so the pasta and the sauce can work together. You don’t need to agonize over the sauce itself, but rather how it's going to adhere to the pasta. Let’s start at the beginning. After dropping the dry noodles into a pot of boiling water, you may be tempted to add a tablespoon of olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking. But adding oil will only make the noodles slippery, and prevent them from mixing nicely with the sauce later on. Instead, when you drop the pasta in the water, use a set of tongs (or a spoon) to separate the noodles inside the pot—then stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping as it cooks. When you’re ready to drain the pasta, reserve some of the cooking liquid to thicken a tomato sauce, loosen a pesto, or help ricotta adhere to the noodles. Add your sauce of choice immediately after draining, and never rinse the pasta with water. Running water over the noodles will strip them of their starches (which is what helps glue the sauce to the pasta), and will make your dish water-y and less flavorful. Ready to get cooking?

2461,"Photo: Mark Wilson/2010 Getty Images As the matchup between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton takes shape, it has begun to dawn on some conservatives that the Republican Party faces a distinct handicap: The Democrats will have two popular ex-presidents to campaign for them, and the GOP will have none. Bill Clinton is the party’s most effective surrogate for wife Hillary, writes Byron York in the conservative Washington Examiner: ""Republicans haven’t had the same luck. The only two-term GOP president in the last generation, George W. Bush, has stayed mostly out of politics in the seven years since he left the White House."" Meanwhile, writing for The Wall Street Journal opinion page, Richard Benedetto grapples with President Obama’s value as a surrogate. ""When Mr. Obama ran for office in 2008, a central part of his campaign strategy was to heap blame on George W. Bush,"" writes Benedetto. ""How has Mr. Obama dodged similar treatment?"" How indeed? The answer, I’d suggest, is something along the lines of by governing competently rather than presiding over a flaming wreck of a presidency. But this answer presumes a level of introspection into the success of the last two Democratic presidents, and the conspicuous failure of the one wedged between them, that is absent from both columns, and from conservative thought in general. York notes ""the GOP’s ex-president situation is a mess,"" a situation he casually describes as ""luck."" The closest his column comes to exploring the source of this misfortune is to note the bad blood between Donald Trump and the Bush family, especially Trump’s statement that Bush peddled false intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. (""Jeb Bush stood haplessly by, unable to defend either himself or his brother."") Of course, Jeb could not defend his brother because, while Trump’s indictment was exaggerated (the Bush administration was victimized by bad intelligence), it was not entirely false (the administration also manipulated the intelligence at its disposal). Benedetto tries to solve the mystery as to why Americans loathed Bush while liking Obama. He does not consider the hypothesis that the comparative performance of the two administrations in domestic and foreign policy may account for this disparity. Instead, Benedetto fixates on the role of Obama’s media manipulation, especially his skillful use of flattering images: He heads a savvy public-relations machine that markets him like a Hollywood celebrity, a role he obligingly and successfully plays. One of the machine’s key tactics is to place Mr. Obama in as many positive news and photo situations as possible. Ronald Reagan’s advisers were considered masters of putting their man in the best possible light, but they look like amateurs compared with the Obama operation—which has the added advantage of a particularly obliging news media. If only Bush’s media handlers had thought to try that! Oh, wait: The news media did in fact transmit the Bush administration’s images of the president swaggering on the deck of the aircraft carrier, and clearing brush on his ranch in a cowboy hat, and standing on the rubble of the building that was destroyed by terrorists after his administration neglected repeated, urgent warnings of a planned attack. Many of these images were fawned over at the time, even by the mainstream media. Chris Matthews slathered over Bush’s ""Mission Accomplished"" coup. The trouble is that it eventually became clear the mission was not accomplished at all. Jimmy Carter’s failed presidency became the Republican Party’s favorite point of comparison for every Democratic candidate or plan well into the 1990s, and they even hauled out the ghost of Carter in 2008 to taint Obama. Carter was a pretty lousy president, though he also suffered from unfortunate macroeconomic timing. Beginning in the 1980s, Republican messaging relied heavily on the connection between the president’s agenda and the economy’s performance. This formula has worked out badly for the last quarter-century, as George H.W. Bush and then his son presided over recessions, and Clinton and then Obama presided over expansions. And yes, long-term trends like negative partisanship have created a situation where most people feel frustrated with politics because they believe their side is losing. Nonetheless, Obama is and has consistently been far, far more popular than any of the leading Republicans. Even if we discount the role of economics completely, though, the difference in governing quality is stark. Democrats have a governing program and a cadre of policy advisers that is responsive to empirical reality and able to effectively respond to real-world problems. Republicans have none of these things, and the rise of Trump has shown that the problem has grown worse, not better. Republicans don’t have an ""ex-president problem.""

2463,"Most of us probably don't even know we're failing this daily task, yet it may be seriously affecting our health. Less than 4 per cent of Australians are eating enough vegetables and legumes each day and most are failing to meet the minimum number of serves recommended for the five major food groups, a new report has found. And it's even worse among Australians aged 18 and younger - fewer than half a per cent are eating the recommended minimum for vegetables, according to the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2011-12, released by the Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday. The report is part of Australia's largest health survey and the first to compare food consumption against the Australian Dietary Guidelines. ""It's getting worse,"" said nutritionist Lucinda Hancock, from Nutrition Australia, citing previous results that showed about seven per cent of adults were meeting the recommended intake for vegetables. ""The way our society is now, we've got so many junk foods out there, so many packaged foods ... Actually making the healthy choice is quite difficult."" More than one third of Australians' daily energy intake comes from 'junk food' such as sweetened beverages, alcohol, cakes, confectionary and pastry products, the report found. Australians fell furthest from the mark when it came to vegetables and legumes, with fewer than one in 25 Australians meeting the minimum recommended number of serves. Only one in 10 eat enough dairy, while one in seven meet the guidelines for lean meats and alternatives. Australians came closest to fulfilling the recommendations for fruit and grains, with one in three meeting the guidelines in each food group. ""However, one-third of the fruit serves was from juice and dried fruit, and two-thirds of the grains and cereals were from refined grains rather than whole grain or high fibre sources,"" said ABS director of health Louise Gates. The Australian Dietary Guidelines, established in 2013, have not been well communicated to the public, said Stephen Colagiuri, from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity at the University of Sydney. ""This report basically underlines that we're not getting the message across. We need to help people to better understand the food that they're eating,"" Professor Colagiuri said, adding that most Australians would probably be surprised to find they were not meeting dietary recommendations. ""There is a disconnect with weight - much of which is determined by what you eat - and the vast array of health consequences that can occur. Especially in the younger age group, their motivation for doing anything about weight is mostly cosmetic rather than for health reasons,"" he said. ""While it's not all that easy to reduce one's weight, what we're really hoping is to prevent the weight gain ... That in itself would have a significant impact on the amount of chronic disease we have."" Ms Hancock said public health initiatives hadn't done enough to make healthy foods the easiest choice in terms of convenience, availability and cost. ""It's all well and good to tell people to follow the dietary guidelines but that message needs to be supported in the entire environment,"" she said. For example, vending machines, convenience stores and food outlets should be encouraged to have easily identifiable healthy food options. The 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend adults eat at least six serves of grain foods, 5-6 serves of vegetables, two serves of fruit, 2.5 serves of dairy products and about three serves of lean meat and alternatives per day, depending on age and gender.",Less than 4 per cent of Australians are eating enough vegetables and legumes each day and most are failing to meet the minimum number of serves recommended for the five major food groups
2465,"Whenever we post LEGO deals on Ben’s Bargains, they’re usually quite popular because regular-price LEGO sets just seem outrageously expensive for children’s toys. The 3,803-piece LEGO Death Star (10188) is frequently cited as an example, retailing for $400. for significantly more than the MSRP during peak buying periods, as are many other popular and/or rare LEGO sets. Yet, we love LEGO anyway and continue to fork over our hard-earned cash for these fantastically well-crafted pieces of (ABS) plastic. The LEGO Death Star has been in production for 5 years (!) and is frequently seen on eBay for significantly more than the MSRP during peak buying periods, as are many other popular and/or rare LEGO sets. Among LEGO buyers, it’s known that the price per brick hovers around 10 to 13 cents. According to Andrew Sielen’s excellent analysis What Happened with LEGO , the price of a brick has been relatively static for the past 8 or 9 years and was even significantly higher two or three decades ago — you know, back when most adults today were playing with LEGOs. And this price stability has occurred in the same time period as the advent of LEGO’s licensed sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter) which actually carry very little to no price markup compared to the non-licensed sets. Expensive, Just Not Crazy Expensive LEGO USS Enterprise? Nope, this is the KRE-O USS Enterprise! Resale Value, Quality and Size LEGO is famous for its crazy attention to detail and precision engineering of the billions of pieces they’ve produced over the decades (over 400 billion since 1958, according to the company). Not only do pieces from different decades fit together with consistent clutch power—which is not always the case for its competitors’ offerings (i.e. MegaBloks) from the same set!— but its high-priced molds are ridiculously accurate with tolerances as minute as 0.0005′′. You’re not gonna be pumping out LEGO-quality bricks with a 3D printer anytime soon. You’re also not gonna find this special sauce in MegaBloks bricks, either. Besides quality, the size of sets is a major factor in the perceived expense of LEGO toys. The aforementioned Death Star is one of the top-five largest LEGO sets with over 3,800 pieces. The more advanced Architecture series LEGO sets often have over 500 pieces with a few over 1,000 pieces. By contrast, the top-of-the-line LEGO set in 1980, the Inter-City Passenger Train Set (7740) , had 786 pieces and the classic LEGO Main Street (6390) had 591 pieces—these sizes are now commonplace. LEGOLAND Main Street — a classic of its time... Higher quality production, the ever-increasing size and complexity of high-end sets and the impressive resale value of LEGO all contribute to its high price tag.

2469,"The Doomsday Clock, a metaphor for global catastrophe, remains set at three minutes to midnight. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Science and Security Board, in conjunction with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates, announced their annual decision on the clock's setting Tuesday afternoon, and said it would stay the same as last year. They said they based their decision on the global threat of climate change, as well as continued nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Russia and between Pakistan and India, and the recent claim by North Korea of testing a hydrogen bomb. Lawrence Krauss, chair of the Board of Sponsors and a renowned physicist and professor at Arizona State University, said that the decision to not move the clock is a sign of the troubles facing humanity. ""It is of grave concern that the situation remains largely the same,"" he told reporters. Despite the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 nations that agreed to reduce carbon emissions, Krauss said that ""the fight against climate change has barely begun."" In order to improve the situation so the clock can be moved back, the Bulletin calls on the citizens of the world to implore leaders to reduce nuclear modernization programs, engage North Korea to reduce nuclear risks, follow up on the Paris accord deal and deal with commercial nuclear waste problems now. Each year, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists analyzes global threats including nuclear weapons, climate-changing technologies, emerging biotechnologies and cybertechnology to determine how close the minute hand on the Doomsday Clock should be to midnight. Midnight, in this case, represents the apocalypse. Last year the Board agreed to move the clock to 11:57 -- two minutes closer to midnight than it was before -- because of a failure to halt climate change and an increasing nuclear arms arsenal. Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, told reporters that world leaders' failure to act on these issues endangers every person in the world. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by University of Chicago scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The metaphoric Doomsday Clock was created two years later. The clock has moved 22 times in 69 years. The closest it has come to midnight was in 1953, when it was set at two minutes to midnight after the United States and Russia tested hydrogen bombs.","The Doomsday Clock, a metaphor for global catastrophe, remains set at three minutes to midnight."

2480,"Here's a good reason to make sure your child gets adequate sleep each night. A new study in the journal Brain Sciences shows that connections are strengthened between the right and left hemispheres of the brain during sleep, as much as 20 percent in just one night. Connections are strengthened by the formation of myelin around brain nerve fibers; myelin serves almost as a form of ""insulation,"" and is an important part of the movement of electrical impulses between cells. ""Interestingly, during a night of sleep, connections weakened within hemispheres but strengthened between hemispheres,"" study researcher Salome Kurth, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in a statement. These strengthening connections are a sign of a maturing brain, which is important to building language and impulse control skills. However, more research is needed to see how exactly sleep strengthens these connections, researchers noted. Kurth and assistant professor Monique LeBourgeois conducted electroencephalograms on eight children at ages 2, 3 and 5, to examine changes in brain activity with increasing age. They found that as the participants got older, the connections got stronger between the left and right hemispheres. Indeed, a past study in mice published in the Journal of Neuroscience also showed that sleep influences myelin production; getting sleep seems to turn on genes linked with myelin formation, while lack of sleep seems to turn on genes linked with cell death.",connections are strengthened between the right and left hemispheres

It's a necessary, if strange, part of the gymnastic rules, which requires $100 to send in an inquiry. The inquiry is essentially the same as a challenge, something common in sports like football and now baseball. Gymnasts can inquire about their routine score before the following score is posted, which makes judges double-check and make sure they received the maximum number of points for their routine. Teams receive the money back if they win the inquiry, but it stays with the IOC if the inquiry is rejected. On Monday, the United States' Laurie Hernandez and France's Marine Boyer both filed inquiries in the Olympics beam event. Boyer was just a tenth behind Simone Biles, who had a bronze finish. The $100 is required to make sure teams don't make capricious challenges, but at the Olympics level, you can imagine teams are happy to risk $100 if it means potential points being added and could be the difference between a medal.

But when it does happen, like with Japan's gymnastics team in the 2012 Olympics as you can see below, the rule goes from odd to suspicious.

Suddenly, a rule looks more like bribery, even though the money has no effect on how the judges would rule on a points decision. It's just so the inquiries aren't used frivolously. Japan actually won their inquiry and received additional points for one of its gymnast's routines. Often, this is how inquiries play out, when coaches notice a move that should earn points that aren't properly awarded. As was the case on Monday, it was probably just two gymnasts being extra sure. At the Olympics, betting $100 on a chance for even an extra tenth of a point is well worth it.

2494,"A space rocket plunges earthward, twitching its steering fins and firing gas jets to stabilise itself. It looks for all the world like it is doomed. But as it nears the surface, the motors burn stronger and the rocket slows considerably, landing legs spring from its sides and, as the billowing smoke disperses, it's clear it has touched down upright – and in one piece. It's a feat that was inconceivable only a decade ago. But after many spectacular failed attempts the Californian rocket maker SpaceX has in the last four months landed an orbital rocket stage four times – once on land in December 2015 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and in April for the first time on a remote-controlled barge in the mid-Atlantic. And these were not dummy rockets: both were the 40-metre-high first stages of Falcon 9 rockets that had just launched commercial spacecraft into orbit. By returning rocket stages to Earth for reconditioning and reuse, SpaceX's founder, billionaire Elon Musk, hopes eventually to make spaceflight as economical as commercial aviation. His point: airlines don't throw away a Boeing 747 after every flight, so why do it with spaceships? Sci-fi has predicted reusable spacecraft for a century or more, and space engineers have experimented with the idea since the mid-20th Century – the partially reusable Space Shuttle is arguably the closest we’ve got. So why has reusability taken so long to be seriously considered? First, it’s worth highlighting that SpaceX is not alone. Blue Origin, backed by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, has launched and then landed its New Shepard suborbital space tourism rocket three times, each time venturing just beyond the edge of space, an altitude of 100km (61 miles). And Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo will also fly on multiple suborbital trips. ""Smaller vehicles which employ modern technologies can be much more reusable than the shuttle, and suborbital vehicles even more so,"" says Virgin CEO George Whitesides. But SpaceX's landings are the greater technical feat. Getting a satellite to low Earth orbit means the rocket needs to be travelling at around 6,000 km/h (3,726mph), and to reach geostationary orbit 9,000 km/h (5,590mph) – before that first stage can be released and return to Earth. ""Suborbital vehicles fly straight up and return directly down,"" says Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux, an American space entrepreneur. ""While that's difficult, the velocity at the top is zero before gravity pulls them back towards the Earth. So sub-orbital reusability is far from being as difficult as orbital reusability,"" she says. So a short explanation for why reusable rockets haven’t arrived earlier is simply the technical difficulty. However, the idea of reusable spaceplanes dates back to before World War Two. Before the Apollo programme, spaceplanes were thought to be the future of reusable spacecraft, says Roger Launius at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air & Space Museum in Washington DC. ""The idea has been out there since the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon science fiction comic strips in the 1920s and 1930s. Every single one of the spacecraft in those strips was a reusable spaceplane. So since before World War Two we always thought spaceflight would be like airplane activity."" After 1945, captured German rocket scientists revealed they had planned – but never built – a suborbital spaceplane, the Silverbird, with which the Nazis had hoped to bomb the US. A novel design feature was that it was shaped like a wing, so its shape helped add aerodynamic lift. This 'lifting body' idea was harnessed by the US Air Force in 1958 when it started work on a reusable winged spaceplane, the X-20 Dyna-Soar – but the Moon program saw that canned in 1963. After the triumph of Apollo, Nasa went straight back to its reusable first love: the winged, reusable spaceplane ""The reusable spaceplane was thrown out of the window because of the space race, which was all about beating the Russians. At the time, the spaceplane was not sufficiently advanced technology for Moonshots – but the research and testing on ballistic capsules had already been done on ICBMs,"" Launius says. ""The reentry capsules they used for a nuclear warhead are basically the same as those you put an astronaut in. You just change the payload."" After the triumph of Apollo, however, Nasa went straight back to its reusable first love: the winged, reusable spaceplane called the Space Shuttle. Five shuttle orbiters averaged 27 missions each; the star of the fleet was Discovery, with 39 missions. ""So spaceplanes have a long history of reusability,"" says Mark Sirangelo, head of SNC Space Systems at Sierra Nevada Corporation in Sparks, Nevada. The downside was that they had to be refurbished between launches – something that applies to SpaceX’s rockets too. While SpaceX has tested whether their rockets can return to Earth, it has yet to refly one. And that is the true test, says Launius. ""If you can reuse any part of a space vehicle you are going to save money on the next launch. But if they have to tear it apart and completely refurbish it every flight you might as well build a new one."" Nasa also persevered with research on a raft of much smaller reusable spaceplanes that are now appearing in other guises. For instance, Nasa's X37 is now used by the US Air Force in the form of the X37B, an unmanned, rocket-launched spaceplane that performs extended secret military missions in low Earth orbit and which then flies home autonomously. And Nasa's HL-20 spaceplane, developed in the late 1980s and 1990s as a potential space station lifeboat, is what has been acquired by Sirangelo's Sierra Nevada Corp and renamed Dream Chaser. SNC is converting the Nasa design into what Sirangelo calls the ""strongest reusable vehicle"" they can make. That has involved swapping out Nasa's metal alloy fuselage for an advanced lightweight composite one."" It will be significantly stronger and more capable of handling spaceflight stresses, pressures and temperatures,"" says Sirangelo. In addition to Nasa cargo flights, Dream Chaser – which can be launched on any modern rocket and land at any airport capable of receiving an Airbus A320 – is being considered by Esa and the German lab DLR for a variety of missions. These could include one to intercept and remove space debris, for instance. Some truly bizarre designs have been suggested to boost reusability While the spaceplane looks like being the most logical way to create a reuseable spacecraft, other more outlandish designs also saw the light. Take the Rotary Rocket Company's 'Roton', a pepperpot-shaped capsule tested in 1999 to avoid a problem that has dogged the hundreds of crew capsules that have returned to Earth since the space race began: they cannot land where they want to and are at the mercy of where parachutes carry them. Rotary Rocket wanted to give a crew the chance to choose where their capsule would make a soft landing, leaving the vehicle more likely to be reusable. To do this, it would re-enter the atmosphere and once in thicker air deploy helicopter rotors embedded in its surface. Driven by rocket motors on the rotor tips they would deploy at a suitable altitude and the crew would navigate, helicopter style to a landing point of their choice: watch the Roton's atmospheric test vehicle below, with smoke and unburned fuel pouring out of the rotor rockets. Unfortunately, the Rotary Rocket Company ran out of cash before their ship got very far. Nasa also once considered rotors, though not rocket driven ones, preferring sycamore-leaf-style autorotation – for its Orion capsule. The Roton’s unconventional approach may partly live on, however, thanks to SpaceX . The seven-seat Dragon V2 crew capsule it's building for Nasa trips to the ISS aims ultimately to be reusable thanks to the eight rocket motors built into its exterior walls. These have two jobs: blasting the crew capsule clear if the rocket carrying it explodes during launch, and firing to provide a soft propulsive landing. Nasa's initial Dragon V2 landings will be conventional parachute drops into the ocean, with propulsive landings following. American rocket firm United Launch Alliance – a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed-Martin – is investigating how to jettison the large, expensive rocket motor at the base of its future Vulcan rocket and have it fly, on a parafoil, for a mid-air recovery snatch by an aircraft – the same way camera film canisters from spy satellites used to be recovered. ULA is also imagining a second stage that stays in orbit, waiting to be refueled for various tasks, such as satellite servicing. There are many generations of reusable space vehicles to come – George Whitesides In France, Airbus is investigating how the rocket motor at the base of the future Ariane 6 rocket could use wings and small jet engines – so it can fly back autonomously to an airport. And the Chinese Space Agency says it is planning reuse of its Long March rocket stages using multiple parachutes. It all makes sense, says Whitesides. ""There are many generations of reusable space vehicles to come. The pioneers like SpaceshipOne, Falcon9, New Shepard and the US Air Force X-37B will have descendants in many different forms, and they hold the promise of radically lower cost to orbit.""",returning rocket stages to Earth for reconditioning and reuse
2496,"It's nice to know that thousands of years ago, human ancestors also sought comfort in food. That's the conclusion of a group of researchers studying men and women who lived in the caves of Mount Carmel -- not far from what is now Haifa, Israel -- between 15,000 and 11,600 years ago. Known as the Natufian civilization, this culture has been the subject of an extensive study by an international group of archaeologists, who have discovered dozens of skeletons in the area. One of the most recent studies of the cave dwellers, slated to be published in the December 2013 version of the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, includes evidence that Natufian men engaged in large communal meals next to grave sights, reports Israeli news outlet Haaretz. Led by Haifa University's Professor Dani Nadel, with the help of colleagues Dr. Reuven Yeshurun and Professor Guy Bar-Oz, the archaeologists searched a location known as the Raqefet Cave and uncovered thousands of small animal bones they believe are evidence of feasts not unlike modern wakes. The Natufian people during the time period studied were undergoing an important transition from being hunter-gatherers to living communally. These wakes potentially represent the fascinating, fledgling attempt at unity by a previously nomadic culture, Yeshurun told The Huffington Post in an email. ""From the beginning of human evolution humans lived in small groups and rarely met other groups, and were probably not used to dealing with dozens of 'neighbors' on a daily basis,"" Yeshurun wrote. ""Such a society would try to form ceremonies and rituals that can unite the large group and resolve tensions. And a 'wake' in the occasion of deaths of group members could have been perfect for that. To this day, food is a very uniting social mechanism, as you know."" Archaeologists have also discovered evidence of burial feasts at other dig sites in Israel; thus, a find like the one outside Haifa is not unprecedented, Yeshurun said. However, researchers in the Natufian caves had to prove that the animal bones they uncovered were not simply leftover garbage and were indeed related to the graves. ""I approached this problem from a garbage point of view,"" Yeshruun explained. ""Having studied the trash patterns at the Natufian villages, I noticed that the Natufians were not really clearing food remains from their houses. As a result, those food remains (animal bones) got constantly trampled and burned when people were stepping there or lighting fires. The bones in the Raqefet Cave graves do not show this pattern; they are significantly less broken and burned from ordinary Natufian 'domestic trash.' Therefore I think that they are not the remains of an earlier occupation. They are connected with the burial."" Yeshurun added that the fact that no stray animal bones were found outside the graves added further evidence supporting his conclusion. This study is related to a similar Natufian discovery that made waves in the archaeological community earlier this summer. In June, Nadal announced that his team had unearthed what appeared to be some of the oldest grave flowers ever found in a cave burial. Carefully positioned, the flowers ""added color and fragrance, and probably all those at the funeral were impressed,"" Nadal told NPR at the time.",Natufian men engaged in large communal meals next to grave sights

You can't move, not even a toe wiggle but you have the feeling that someone is there lurking in the shadows, observing your helpless state while you try to move your lips to make a sound, call for help, but you just lie there with a pressure on your chest, as if someone is sitting on it and you can't get enough air and you keep seeing that black figure. So something like this. There are accounts of sleep paralysis that date as far back as the 10th century in Persian texts and was originally considered as the nightmare. Myths and folklore contributed to the belief that sleep paralysis occurred due to visitations by demonic entities often with malicious intent or by incubi. The demonic presence was said to have sat on the chests of the victims thus leading to the suffocating sensation or the pressure on chest. While some still believe in these theories governed by religious beliefs, science has some perfectly reasonable explanations for the phenomenon. Here are some terrifying accounts of sleep paralysis by people. Reddit user FLAPPY-BIRCH narrated the experience: The way that it started for me was I woke up in the middle of the night and went into my kitchen to get a cup of water and when I looked into my living room there was like a hooded old person. IDK how to explain it really but I got super freaked out and instantly knew what was happening but it was so real I kept doubting myself. So I paced back to my bedroom and went back to bed, but when I woke up I was in your ""typical"" sleep paralysis episode. I was laying in bed, couldn't move, and there was a big black thing hovering above me. It almost felt like when your arm falls asleep, except your whole body. I kept forcing myself to go back to sleep but whenever I woke up the same thing happened. Another experience by whatwouldscoobydo will leave you hoping this never happens to you: I had it happen to me, in my early teens. I had no idea what sleep paralysis was at the time. I never realized I was paralyzed, always too focused on what I felt / heard / saw. I legitimately thought my house was haunted, or that I was somehow aware of other creatures others couldn't see (even though I knew logically this made little sense, I didn't know what else to attribute it to at the time). The one in particular was a dark humanoid figure that crab-walked (that was it's normal stance). It had no eyes or mouth. It would come up behind my head board and watch me, or crawl on to the walls and observe me. I never got the sense that it wanted to harm me, only that it was an observing predator and could kill me if it wanted to. Worse was the sensory shit, though. I once had a hand reach out from the wall (didn't see it, only felt it) and gently, slowly, grasp my ankle. It felt 100% real. Then it tried pulling me in to the wall. By far the scariest thing I ever experienced with sleep paralysis; I'm super glad it doesn't happen often anymore. This account by Terakian is plain freaky: I had it happen about two years ago. Didn't see anything either. But I remember waking up and already feeling very afraid. Tried to scream to wake my girlfriend next to me, but couldn't - THAT'S a scary feeling. The unique aspect of it was that I remember when I tried to close my eyes and just go back to sleep, the room really felt like it was closing in on me - a loud and strong groan (like a building falling inwards) in my ears, and a powerful pressure on my chest. Only lasted around a minute, but honestly one of the scariest minutes of my life. Had no idea what was going on. Sleep paralysis is dependent on the stages of sleep you're at. If it happens as you're falling asleep, it is known as hypnagogic or predormital sleep paralysis. When we fall asleep we gradually lose consciousness and our muscles relax and loosen up but sometimes during this period the brain remains aware and doesn't shut down and that's when we experience sleep paralysis where we are unable to move or speak but are aware. It commonly happens as we are waking up and this is called hypnopompic or postdormital sleep. This occurs because during sleep we shift through different stages such REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. During NREM stage, we sleep deeply, this is when the body does its rejuvenating by relaxing muscles. This is followed by the REM stage where our brain has similar activity as when we are awake. REM is characterised by rapid side to side eye movements and detailed, vivid dreams but the body remains in lockdown mode to prevent us from acting out these dreams as they could prove dangerous. Sometimes our brain becomes aware before we slip out of the REM phase and that's when we cannot move or speak. There are explanations for the hallucinations or sightings of dark figures during sleep paralysis. The feeling that someone may be in the room with you or sitting on your chest is due to the muscle paralysis that occurs in sleep. You take shallow breaths during muscle paralysis but when you try take deeper breaths you feel that you can't. The mind may interpret this as being strangled or as someone sitting on your chest. When we are in a state where we feel there is danger, such as in cases of sleep paralysis, the body goes into fight or flight mode and releases a surge of adrenaline. The heart beats faster and we are in a super alert state and so anything might seem more than it actually is. The brain might try to pinpoint dark shapes as potential danger. We might even experience hypnagogic hallucinations where all our senses are stimulated to create something which isn't there. You might feel as if something is touching you or notice an unpleasant smell or see dark figures but that's just the result of a very creative brain. Our keen state during sleep paralysis makes our brain frantically run through possibilities of danger and our defense mechanism makes it seem that there is a menacing presence in our room. Sometimes our dreams overlap reality and when we wake up from vivid dreams we might feel for sometime that the presence in the dream is there for real. Normally people go through sleep paralysis just a few times, commonly during teenage but these require no treatment. However, in case these are regular occurrences which are understandably terrifying and worrisome, you could: Visit a sleep specialist to find out if you have narcolepsy. Determine whether you have a history of mental illness in cases of extreme hallucinations. Clomipramine, an anti-depressant is known to modify your REM sleep to stop sleep paralysis. Stop using medications which could trigger sleep paralysis such as medicines for ADHD. Visit doctors who could advise you on your sleep patterns.","When we fall asleep we gradually lose consciousness and our muscles relax and loosen up but sometimes during this period the brain remains aware and doesn't shut down and that's when we experience sleep paralysis where we are unable to move or speak but are aware.

2501,"Meerkat’s latest update: the livestreaming app is shifting focus from Twitter to Facebook. Meerkat users can now sign in with a Facebook account that automatically connects to all their Facebook friends or followers. Meerkat got a harsh blow in March when Twitter blocked it from accessing its users to prioritize its own competing livestream service Periscope. Facebook, on the other hand, has been helpful – suggesting that the social network has no plans to build its own livestreaming app. It’s also possible that Facebook sees Meerkat as a potential acquisition. The social network has a long list of successful targets like WhatsApp and Instagram. L2’s Scott Galloway predicted in a recent talk that the latter would bring in $1.5 billion in revenue within three years, making it a ""great acquisition choice"" as young people drifted from Facebook to Instagram. This roster of acquisitions is just one reason that L2 is sticking to its 2011 prediction that Facebook – which just surpassed the value of Walmart – is set to become the most valuable company in the world. Another reason is Facebook’s remarkable pivot to mobile. Three years ago, Facebook had yet to adapt to the growing predominance of mobile devices. Today, nearly $2.5 billion comes from mobile ads, accounting for 69% of total ad revenue. Facebook’s native videos are also challenging YouTube’s dominance. The social network has successfully capitalized on brands’ desire to build a following. After convincing brands to spend millions on establishing communities, Facebook then convinced them to pay for access to those communities. At the same time, it has become one of the largest and most profitable content platforms, despite not being a content creator – making the social network one of the biggest winners in digital media.","Twitter blocked it from accessing its users to prioritize its own competing livestream service Periscope.

2502,"Armed with a bit of get-up-and-go and good planning, you can be fitter than ever without spending a penny. We've enlisted the help of top fitness experts to help you explore new ways and places to exercise for free. Walking is underrated as a form of exercise, but it's one of the easiest ways to get more activity into your day, lose weight and become healthier. Research shows that people who fit moderate activity, such as walking, into their daily life burn more energy than those who make weekly visits to the gym. Try to fit walking into your routine by ditching the car for short journeys, walking all or part of your journey to work, getting off the bus or train one stop early and planning longer walks at the weekends. To reap the health benefits, aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which can burn up to 400 calories. To keep track of your walking, use a pedometer. Couch to 5K (C25K) is a free running plan developed to help absolute beginners get into running. Running is great for weight loss, improving heart and lung function, strengthening bones and giving you a general sense of wellbeing. C25K was developed by a novice runner who decided to write a plan to help his fifty-something mum get off the couch and start running too. The plan involves three runs a week, with a day of rest in between each, with a different plan for each of the nine weeks. NHS Choices has developed its own set of free C25K podcasts to help you to achieve your running goal. Rediscover the truly invigorating and liberating experience of riding a bike and boost your health in the process. Figures show that about 42 per cent of Britons own a bicycle. Whether you're cycling to work, to school, to the shops or just for fun, the humble bicycle is an easy way to get more active. Cycling to work is one of the easiest ways of fitting exercise into your day. It'll also save you money on petrol or public transport costs. If you don't have a bike, you may be able to get a cheap bike through the Cycle to Work scheme. If you have an old bike that's been gathering dust, consider having it serviced at a specialist bike shop to ensure it's roadworthy before taking it out for a spin. No-one likes taking the stairs. That's why man invented lifts. But if you're looking for an easy way to add more activity into your day, taking the stairs is a no-brainer. Stair climbing burns more calories per minute than jogging and counts towards your recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise. Research shows regularly taking the stairs is good for strong bones, cardiovascular fitness and weight management. It's also a safe, low-impact exercise that requires no equipment. One of the best parts about stair climbing is how easy it is to build it into daily life. Walk past those lifts, take the stairs and track how many calories you burn with the free StepJockey app. Remember the games you used to play in the playground? Games like ""hide and seek"", ""it"", ""stuck in the mud"" and ""cowboys and Indians"" aren't just good fun, they're an excellent workout too. Denise Page, YMCAfit director, says playground games are like the interval training that athletes use. ""These games involve short sharp bursts of activity and periods of rest, which are very effective for improving fitness, especially if you're not usually very active,"" she says. Park games are an ideal way for all the family to get active together, have fun and reap the health benefits in the process. If you've not used a skipping rope since your school playground days then now's your chance to rediscover how fun and beneficial skipping can be. An excellent way to keep fit, skipping can be done anywhere at any time. Just a few minutes' skipping training brings a whole range of health benefits, including heart and lung fitness, strong bones, balance and flexibility. The average person will burn up to 200 calories during 15 minutes of skipping. Skipping is a strenuous exercise, so start slowly. Try skipping for 20-30 seconds, marching on the spot for 30 seconds, and then repeat. As your fitness improves you can increase the time you skip for. Once you have perfected the basic move, you can make your workout more interesting by trying different jumps. Trim trails (also known as fitness trails or activity trails) are made up of simple pieces of exercise equipment, such as parallel bars, leapfrog blocks, inclined press-ups and balance beams, dotted around parks, recreation areas or alongside cycle routes. The free equipment can be used to do various exercises, including step-ups, sit-ups, lunges and press ups, to develop balance, strength and co-ordination. ""As with all new exercise routines, start slowly and stay within your comfort zone,"" says fitness trainer Joanna Hall. ""Increase the intensity of the workout gradually as your fitness improves."" Go online to learn how to do the exercises properly to get the most from them and avoid injury. Ask your local council if there's a trim trail in your area. Improve your health and the environment at the same time with the outdoor alternative to the gym. Work up a sweat digging, planting, lopping and path-clearing at one of 95 free Green Gyms around the country, run by The Conservation Volunteers. Experienced leaders guide volunteers through a range of practical projects, giving you the opportunity to tackle physical jobs in the outdoors. This can improve your strength and stamina, and boost your practical skills and confidence. There are sessions for all fitness levels and no previous gardening or conservation experience is necessary. Watch a video on Green Gyms. Research by the University of Essex shows that exercising outdoors boosts people's physical and mental health more than going to indoor gyms, even in winter.  With this in mind, the National Trust has enlisted outdoor exercise specialists Eco Fitness to devise a free outdoor fitness programme you can follow whatever the weather. The 31-day plan has been designed to ease people into an outdoors regime where exercise is fun rather than a chore. No equipment is needed. Exercises in the challenge include power walking, tree press ups and 'spotty dogs' (stepping backwards on the spot using opposite arms and legs). Military-style fitness classes are all the rage at the moment in parks up and down the country. There's no reason why you can't create your own boot-camp-style workout for free and without someone barking orders at you. Just plan your routine, mixing running with a series of exercises such as jumping jacks, squats, lunges, running stairs, push-ups, bench dips and squat thrusts. Do a bit of research online to make sure you're doing the exercises correctly before starting out. For extra motivation, try to enrol a friend to do the boot camp sessions with you. People often give away fitness gear, such as weights, skipping ropes or exercise balls. They are the kind of things people buy with high hopes and then the equipment lies around gathering dust, ready for you to take it off their hands. Check community freebie sites such as Freegle, Freecycle and SnaffleUp and put out emails to say you're looking out for exercise equipment. Search regularly and you might get lucky. Another option is to swap your own unwanted exercise gear for some different sports equipment using websites like SwapShop and Swapz. The idea of walking up to a group of strangers during a game of football and asking to join in may sound slightly unnerving but, provided you can work up the bottle, this is both an excellent way to get fit and to make friends. Choose a group of players of similar age and ability and who seem like they're just starting their game. If the game's already started, the goalkeeper is probably the best person to approach. More often than not, you'll be welcomed and it will open up the possibility of getting a regular game and a free workout. Mall walking, which is brisk walking through large shopping centres, is a craze sweeping the US and catching on here. The walks, which are generally held in the morning, are free of charge and aimed at people who don't normally walk very much but who want to improve their fitness. Mall walking provides an excellent opportunity to exercise and socialise in a safe, secure, warm and dry environment. ""A 30-minute brisk walk incorporating some stair climbing and lunges can burn around 200 calories,"" says health and fitness writer Peta Bee. Mall walking groups operate nationwide at shopping centres such as the Bullring in Birmingham, The Trafford Centre in Manchester and the White Rose in Leeds. Your local leisure centre may well be offering initiatives such as free exercise classes or a free swim on certain days of the week to encourage people to get in shape. Many authorities also have outdoor gyms (which include much of the same equipment found in an indoor gym), basketball hoops, tennis courts and football pitches that you can use free of charge. You may also be entitled to free leisure services if you're under 16 or over 60 or if you receive benefits. Fitness expert Laura Williams says: ""Contact your local authority to find out what's on offer and take full advantage of these facilities, which are funded by your taxes after all."" If you want to give the gym a go or you're developing withdrawal symptoms after cancelling your membership, take advantage of the free one-day gym passes many chains offer. Be advised that the gym will probably try their best to get you to sign up for paid membership afterwards, but there's no obligation whatsoever for you to do so.","To reap the health benefits, aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which can burn up to 400 calories.

2506,"Life in a world governed by inhibitions can be taxing. You're constantly oppressed, devoid of fundamental rights, and asked to give away your wishes for nought.  But even after all these years of relentless struggle, it will take some time for a change to come along. Speaking of a similar case, this guy shared a story of his ex-classmate in a series of tweets. The story speaks about how an erudite individual became someone's housewife. It speaks about how, thousands of girls every year, give up on their career, education, intelligence, potential, and capacity because they get married.  And while marriage may have nothing to do with what you do with your career, in the recent years, it has emerged as something which says otherwise.  Something's been pinching me for some days now. Thought of letting it out of my system by sharing it here. Here goes....... Read the full story here: 1. There was this girl in my school, back in 90's. Brilliant, studious, hard working, very confident, a topper, a debater, a class prefect.... 2. We were class fellows. She was the kind of girl with whom boys talked after rehearsing. Despite mad competition between us, we were friends. 3. I guess the proudest moments of my school and college life were whenever I scored better than her in exams. Couldn't beat her in confidence 4. We both chose engineering after college and graduated. I chose to work in an industry and she chose to pursue Masters in engineering. 5. Later, she joined one of the best universities of the country as a lecturer in Engineering. That's when her parents decided to marry her off 6. An arranged marriage in a well off family meant that she had to quit job & live as a house wife. This wasn't all, guy was a college dropout. 7. She resisted as much as she could. But after sometime, she agreed to everything saying, ""my parents are too old& scared of me being single"". 8. Parents, too old and too scared. That was the reason for this brilliant girl to give up all her dreams, her ego and her career. 9. The guy was nearly an uneducated, spoiled brat of a business family who couldn't stomach a woman having an education, or an opinion, or ego. 10. In no time after her wedding she realized that he was verbally and physically abusive and his family supported and encouraged all this. 11. But she kept quiet in the face of all abuse because her parents were too old and too scared. 12. She had no money to spend on herself and her husband never bothered to give her a penny. She had already quit her job. So there was no way. 13. Very recently she texted me that her husband had beaten her and given her talaaq twice and if after two times talaaq she could live with him 14. Shocked, I asked why would she live with a man so abusive and so insulting. Her reply was, ""My parents are too old.... sick and scared."" Most women these days are still shackled by what their family thinks and what their family wants. In retrospect, it is always a good option to leave your job/career/life for a good marriage. But why?  Girls! Your parents love you. But one day, they will be old, sick and scared. DO NOT QUIT YOUR CAREER FOR MARRIAGE. Earn you own money. It does not matter if you're thirty or thirty five, do not marry, I say DO NOT MARRY a man you feel is unsuitable for you. Marriage shouldn't happen at the cost of your career. Both of them stand mutually exclusive of each other and it should be kept that way. In today's times, it is extremely integral for an individual, be it a man or a woman, to have a career, to have a constant source of earning, to be independent, and most importantly, to be financially stable.  Parents! One day, you will be old, sick and scared. Please raise your daughters as persons and not as commodity. Let them work and earn. Teach your girls to live on their own and never depend on a man for their survival. Do not force them to marry if there is no compatibility. Wait for your dream man, but do not wait for him to pay your bills. Just because most women don't have a free-flow of income, they chose to stay in an abusive relationship.  But you don't deserve that. None of us does.  And it is a humble request to all the parents, to stop forcing girls into marrying someone just because they are hitting that age.  Parents! Don't panic if your girl is in 30's & single. Let her pursue her dreams. Don't blackmail your girl for marriage. This isn't love. Girls! Do not be blackmailed in the name of family, honor or parents. You are the ones who have to live with the man, YOU decide. Speak for yourself and take care of yourself. And if you know anyone who's going through this, please help them.  Parents! Teach your sons to respect women. Teach them that they're marrying a human being and they're equals. Let your daughter-in-law work.",DO NOT MARRY a man you feel is unsuitable for you
2508,"The alarm buzzes angrily: it is four o’clock in the morning. Although my body protests, I get up and, a few minutes later, start driving through the darkness. I am not the only one: a line of headlights is slowly moving along the winding road up Cadillac Mountain, the easternmost peak in the United Sates. All of us want to be the first people in America to greet the dawn. This ritual is one of the ""musts"" in Acadia National Park, in the northeast corner of Maine. On the flat 1,530ft summit, hundreds have gathered. There are babies and grandparents, children and dogs. As we look east, the star-studded sky over the Atlantic slowly morphs from inky black to deep blue, then charcoal grey and finally, rosy pink. As cameras and phones capture the moment, there is a murmur of appreciation, rather than the American rah-rah I expected. Cadillac Mountain is the tallest of a score of peaks in this park, which takes up most of Mount Desert Island. On August 25, the US National Park Service (nps.gov) will officially be celebrating its 100th birthday with events around the nation and Acadia, the oldest national park east of the Mississippi River – is having a centenary jamboree of its own this year. What makes Acadia so special for me is the juxtaposition of granite mountains and ocean, dense forest and sandy coves, lakes and tidal pools. An easy five-hour drive from Boston, this is one big adventure playground. A photo posted by Acadia National Park (@acadianps) on Aug 12, 2016 at 3:45am PDT I start exploring by bike, pedalling along ""carriage roads"" that loop up hill and down dale. ""About 45 miles of gravel road were designed and built in the early 20th century by John D Rockefeller Jr,"" my guide, Lenny, explains. The financier once owned much of the park’s 75 square miles and spent summers here. On these lanes, horses did the work; Rockefeller’s guests admired the scenery in comfort, without building up a sweat – unlike me. Our 18-mile ride takes us past Eagle Lake, Witch Hole Pond and over – or under – elegant stone bridges. We see maples, aspen, birch and soaring white pines. ""The pines were perfect for ships’ masts,"" Lenny says. ""Back in colonial days, the best were labelled as the King’s Pines and reserved for the Royal Navy."" He points out wild raspberries and the low-bush blueberries for which Maine is known, plus luminous orange mushrooms. ""Hallucinogenic!"" Lenny tells me, with a chuckle. Having given my legs a workout on the bike, the next day it is the turn of my arms. Both stable and easy to manoeuvre, modern sea kayaks are a great way to get out on to the water. I join a small group that includes novice and experienced paddlers, from young teenagers to 60-somethings. Under the watchful eye of our guide, Olivia, we set off from Bar Harbor, the island’s main town. ""It’s named after the huge sandbar, right there, just offshore,"" she explains. ""At low tide you can walk across, but be careful: you can be cut off when the tide turns."" We skim past diving cormorants, keeping our eyes peeled for harbour seals, porpoises and bald eagles. The wind in our faces stirs up waves and spray. ""It’s a challenge now, but will be easier on the way home,"" Olivia says, encouragingly. But the weather on the Maine coast can be shifty. In a matter of minutes, the sea mist has rolled in. Offshore, the cries of gulls are punctuated by the lonely hoot of a fog horn. It is all very moody. We stay close to shore and pull up on the pebbly beach in Cromwell Cove, where Olivia provides a quick geology lesson. Acadia was under a glacier 15,000 years ago. As the ice retreated, it sculpted the landscape, gouging out Somes Sound, the fjord that separates the eastern and western flanks of the island. On the way back to base, with the wind behind us, my fellow paddlers swap stories of what to do in Acadia. The US National Parks Service turns 100 this month A student enthuses about her day spent rock climbing: ""We wore special shoes that provided traction, so we could Spiderman up."" An older couple recommends the Abbe Museum for its exhibitions about the Wabanaki tribes of Maine. ""But that is in busy Bar Harbor,"" they add. ""We prefer to stay in pretty villages, such as Northeast Harbor and Southwest Harbor, with their galleries and cafés."" And that is what I love about Acadia: holidays can be as energetic or as relaxed as you want. Maine is all about the simple pleasures. On Mount Desert Island, the small communities come alive in summer. Accommodation is unfussy but comfortable. Clapboard hotels have broad porches, rocking chairs and water views. ""Getting away from it all"" is no cliché: there is often no television in the rooms and – shock, horror – no signal for mobile phones. As for eating out, the best restaurants are the plainest: lobster shacks. A photo posted by Acadia National Park (@acadianps) on Sep 11, 2015 at 11:29am PDT In Southwest Harbor, Beal’s is not only a working lobster and fish pier, but also a restaurant. Wearing a plastic bib, I get down and dirty, tearing a lobster apart with my fingers. Sitting elbow-to-elbow at wooden picnic tables on a warm evening, with a salty breeze off the water, this is the perfect end to a day of soft adventure. Because lobster is synonymous with Maine, I join up with veteran lobsterman Captain John Nicolai – not to eat the delicacy, but to learn about the lifestyle of these crustaceans. Once aboard the Lulu, we motor out to Frenchman Bay, listening to Cap’n John explaining everything from a lobster’s sex life to how it is caught. Hauling up a trap, he explains the clever, yet simple, design: ""The first chamber is the kitchen, the second is the parlour. Once they are in the parlour, they cannot get out."" There are some three million traps in Maine waters and 90 per cent are within three miles of the rugged coast: ""That’s because lobsters love rocks."" Back on land, my final adventure combines hiking with birdwatching. Acadia is on the Atlantic Flyway, so this is a great place for birders. As for where to go, with some 130 miles of trails, the only problem is choice. And that is why I am with guide Rich MacDonald. ""Some trails are steep, others flat,"" he explains. ""And with car parks near the trailheads, you are off straight away."" Our two-mountain hike starts off easily enough, through spruce and red cedar. Then it is up, steeply up. The trail zigzags through cracks in the boulders, with handholds in the granite. Some label this section ""challenging""; I call it fun. Suddenly, we are above the trees and walking along the spine of Penobscot Mountain. ""That ank-ank sound is the red-breasted nuthatch,"" Rich whispers. ""And the high-pitched melodious trill is the cedar waxwing."" At the 1,194ft summit, we savour the vista, before continuing on, down into the saddle and up again, to the crest of the even taller Sargent Mountain. We look down to islands, bays and the narrows that separate Mount Desert Island from the mainland. ""On a clear day,"" Rich tells me, ""you can see for 120 miles."" The sky is deep blue; the sun sparkles on the water; the view is like a tourism poster come to life. Before heading down the mountain, we start chatting to another hiker, who hails from France. ""The Alps may be higher,"" he tells me, ""but having mountains, lakes and the sea all together – this is truly special."" ""So, in Michelin terminology,"" I ask, ""is this 'vaut le détour’ – worth the detour? "" ""Non,"" he replies: ""Vaut le voyage.""

2509,"The cure for Ebola may come from ... cows? A group of 50 cattle genetically engineered to contain human DNA is able to produce human antibodies that may fight off the Ebola virus, according to SAB Biotherapeutics, which has developed these specialty cattle. Donating plasma from Ebola survivors to Ebola patients may help patients heal, because survivors' blood contains Ebola-fighting antibodies. After these cows get vaccinated against serious diseases, their bodies make antibodies in response and in large quantities. This may make more blood with Ebola antibodies available to patients with the illness. ""From these animals, we can collect 30 to 60 liters of plasma each month,"" Eddie Sullivan, president and CEO of SAB Biotherapeutics, told NBC News. ""That translates into something between 500 to 1,000 human doses per month per animal."" Researchers at SAB had been working with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to test this approach on another disease, hantavirus, but switched gears once Ebola became an epidemic. The cattle are located on a farm in Iowa. It is unknown if survivors’ blood can really heal Ebola patients, but Dr. Kent Brantly, who survived the disease, has donated more than a gallon of his own blood plasma to other infected patients in hopes that it can.","A group of 50 cattle genetically engineered to contain human DNA is able to produce human antibodies that may fight off the Ebola virus, according to SAB Biotherapeutics"
2512,"And a child shall build it? A long-discussed footbridge project over a Key West waterway has been resuscitated by unlikely champion: a 10-year-old girl who presented plans to City Commissioners last week for an 85-foot rainbow-colored span that would salute Key West's diversity. ""Key West welcomes many different people,"" Adelle Barsky-Moore of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea told commissioners. ""It has equality for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders. The bridge will celebrate diversity with the many colors of the gay pride flag."" And it could become reality. Barsky-Moore, whose parents are gay, first conceived of the ""Rainbow Pride Bridge"" for a 4th grade class project, spending three weeks building a popsicle-stick model and crafting a presentation, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Her bridge will be ""more fabulous"" than rainbow-colored crosswalks installed in West Hollywood, her PowerPoint presentation promised commissioners. Barsky-Moore calculated the span, built of steel and wood, will cost roughly $132,500 -- but could be partially paid for with funds raised by selling name inscriptions at $100 each. Though she originally designed the bridge for an area just west of Duval Street, commissioners thought it would be perfect over Admiral's Cut as part of a $30 million master plan to develop former Navy property on the waterfront. ""I thought it was a brilliant idea,"" City Commissioner Jimmy Weekley told KeysNet.com. ""I'm going to push this forward and try to get this accomplished."" Key West first has to come to an agreement with a family who owns the land in question, Weekley said. But not only did Barsky-Moore's presentation win ""initial endorsement"" from the city commission, KeysNews.com reports St. Petersburg architect Andy Hayes, who happened to overhear her proposal, offered to donate design fees if the city moves on the project. There is one drawback, according to the Sun Sentinel: a new popsicle model may be necessary.

2513,"My parents are My parents are divorced . They actually had a good divorce. It doesn’t make me sad to think or talk about it. I have no memories of terrible fights or custody battles. No, they decided their marriage wasn’t working out and just decided to go forward as friends instead. They’re still best friends to this day. So, I guess as far as children of divorce go, I’m the best-case scenario. That being said, I don’t want to get divorced. I want to get married and live happily ever after. I mean, don’t we all? Maybe not the marriage thing but the happily ever after. Nobody wants to fall in love with THE ONE, only to have it all fall apart years down the line. Whether we admit it or not, I think we’re all terrified of getting divorced. That being said, a , finds what increases the probability of divorce for some couples. Whether we admit it or not, I think we’re all terrified of getting divorced. That being said, a new study shows some of us should be a little more terrified than others. Harvard sociologist, Alexandra Achen Killewald’s study, published in the American Sociological Reviewfinds what increases the probability of divorce for some couples. This study was no joke. She tracked 6,309 (yes, 6,309) married couples between 1968 and 2013. In that time, 1,684 of these couples either divorced or permanently separated. What she found in her study was interesting. While a wife’s paid or unpaid labor has little to do with her chance at a divorce, whether or not the husband is working full-time is the biggest determinant in their likelihood of getting divorced. Turns out that, despite the many strides we’ve made in feminism since 1968, we still like our men to be breadwinners. A man with full-time employment has a 2.5 percent of his marriage splitting up within the next year, while a man without a full-time job endured a 3.3 percent chance of the same. Killewald explains the significance of these findings to Killewald explains the significance of these findings to New York Magazine’s Science of Us This shows that, for contemporary couples, wives can combine paid and unpaid labor in various ways without threatening the stability of their marriages. Meanwhile, men have to be a little more concerned, But, for those same marriage cohorts, the risk of divorce increases substantially when the husband isn’t employed full-time.

2514,"Is Seasons 1 & 2 of ‘Mr Robot’ on Netflix? Can you stream Mr Robot on Netflix? When will seasons 1 and 2 of Mr Robot be on Netflix? All will be revealed as we take a look at the deals surrounding USA Networks juggernaut show and determine its status on Netflix in the US and abroad. Mr Robot was one of the best shows to debut in 2015. Period. It’s emphasis on technology, big business and subject matter as a whole as never been more relevant and with pleasing visuals, impressive acting from everyone and plot twists you never see coming, it makes for great television that everyone should be watching. We follow Elliot, an anti-social computer genius who is in a boring life grinding away in the system. He joins a force that is attempting to break the cycle and get the truth out. As I say, the show is brilliant and is actually not given the full credit it’s deserved. It’s a masterpiece. With season 2 rolling around in 2016, we’ve been asked loads about the status of Mr Robot on Netflix and the news isn’t so great I’m afraid. For those in the US, you’ve probably noticed that as of right now, the season 1 or 2 of Mr Robot cannot be found streaming. The first step to look at why Mr Robot isn’t on Netflix is to see the network. USA Network, while not completely new, is relatively new and while some of their content (mainly third party titles) are available on Netflix, their first party library is pretty much vacant. This is a similar stance the cable giant HBO has, refusing to add its shows to Netflix. So if you can’t watch on Netflix, what options do you have? Thankfully that’s easy to answer. As of the time or writing, you can watch the entirety of season 1 on Hulu for free and it’s available as part of your Amazon Prime subscription too. Looking abroad, Amazon Prime in the majority of regions have the show locked up and therefore won’t be coming to Netflix, particularly given the shows popularity. It really sucks that some of the best shows out there at the moment, Game of Thrones, Modern Family and Mr Robot are all vacant from Netflix but as always, if anything changes, we’ll let you know here on What’s on Netflix.",the season 1 or 2 of Mr Robot cannot be found streaming

2520,"Facebook stalking gets you moody, and the terror of an accidental 'like' in the 'Kavos 2k13' album means the practice is probably best avoided. Looking through endless live feeds of people's carefully curated best moments probably isn't the best way to make you happy. After all, lifestyle comparison against the best everyone else has to offer, is not a fair contest. Regardless, how do you find out who's been checking up on you? Facebook has just added a new feature, which is startlingly similar to one found on rival platform Snapchat, that allows you to find out. The company said that they will never permit features that allow other users to see who viewed their profile, which happens in networks like LinkedIn. However, the new 'Stories' feature on the Facebook app allows you to see who has viewed your stories and specifically which parts of it. Much like Snapchat lets you know when people view your stories. Or like Facebook-owned Instagram, which introduced the feature after it saw the success on Snapchat. Or like Facebook Messenger. Or Facebook-owned Whatsapp. Facebook has prominently placed the feature in all its apps now, begging the question; why do you need four different versions of the app on your phone, just because they don't like a little social media competition? In fact, why do you need an app that just exists to flog crap to you through ads and sell your data and personal information to advertisers?","However, the new 'Stories' feature on the Facebook app allows you to see who has viewed your stories and specifically which parts of it"
2522,"Forget frying, poaching, or hard-boiling. These days, the most interesting and trendiest way to prepare your yolks is by curing. Burying the golden orbs in a mixture of salt and sugar for a handful of days dries them out and concentrates their flavor, just like bacon or lox. The result is something semi-firm, salty, and savory. Think: eggy aged cheese, with an eye-poppingly pretty orange color. Cured egg yolks are delicious—but strong. Because they're super salty, they're better used as condiment than as the main event. For an umami boost, try grating them just like cheese over pasta, salads, avocado toast, popcorn, or even scrambled eggs. Currently, cured yolks aren't even available in the most upscale grocery stores, so you'll have to make your own. Even better if you're raising chickens at home and have your own fresh eggs on hand.  Fortunately, the process couldn't be easier. Here's how: 1. Start by combining 1 cup salt and 1 cup sugar in a bowl. Mix well to combine. Place half the mixture in a small baking dish. 2. Separate 4 egg yolks, saving the whites for another use. Carefully place each egg yolk on top of the salt-sugar mixture, and gently sprinkle the yolks with the rest of the salt-sugar mixture. (This photo shows the eggs before they were completely covered. You want them to be totally submerged in the salt-sugar mixture.) Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 4 days.  3. Remove the egg yolks from the fridge after 4 days. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the salt-sugar mixture off of the egg yolks. Run the yolks under cold water to wash any of the remaining salt-sugar mixture off. 4. Place the yolks on a paper towel to drain and pat off any excess water. Transfer the yolks to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake them at 150 degrees for 2 hours. 5. At this point, the eggs yolks should be semi-firm and look sort of like dried apricots. Use them right away, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks. *In case you missed the memo, egg yolks are totally good for you. They're packed with protein, vitamin D, and omega-3s. And even though egg yolks are high in cholesterol, for most people, consuming dietary cholesterol doesn't increase your blood cholesterol.","Burying the golden orbs in a mixture of salt and sugar for a handful of days dries them out and concentrates their flavor, just like bacon or lox."
2525,"As more and more of your friends go gluten-free, you may be wondering: Is there something to this latest diet craze? Is gluten-intolerance a thing? Is it getting more common? The answer is simply no. Only about 1% of Americans actually have celiac disease, the rare genetic disorder that makes people intolerant to gluten, and that number is not on the rise. In other words, in a room of 100 people, chances are one has celiac. In fact, a study published this month found that the prevalence of celiac has remained basically unchanged since 2009. And as for all those people who say they don't have celiac but are just ""sensitive"" to gluten, a 2013 study out of Monash University suggested that this probably isn't real. Alan Levinovitz, an assistant professor at James Madison University who studies the intersection between religion and medicine and the author of the book ""The Gluten Lie,"" says it essentially comes down to a mix of psychology and behavioral change. In the book, Levinovitz interviews Monash University director of gastroenterology Peter Gibson, who helped write the 2013 study concluding that non-celiac gluten ""intolerance"" was probably not a thing. Gibson says the real reason that many people who have cut gluten claim to feel healthier afterwards is simply because they've changed their diet. ""I've noticed [this] lots of times, even with family members,"" Gibson tells Levinovitz. ""They've decided they're eating a lot of takeaway foods, quick foods, not eating well at all. They read this thing about gluten-free, and then they're buying fresh vegetables, cooking well, and eating a lot better."" In other words, while cutting gluten may seem like it helps you lose weight or clears up your complexion, the reality is that 500 other things could be the real cause. ""Blaming the gluten is easy, but you could point to about a hundred things they're doing better,"" Gibson adds. But this can be a tough pill to swallow. ""When it comes to food sensitivities, people are incredibly unwilling to question self-diagnoses,"" Levinovitz writes. ""No one wants to think that the benefits they experienced from going gluten-free ... might be psychological."" On top of that, connecting what we've eaten to physical symptoms is incredibly difficult. Not only have studies shown that we have trouble remembering what we ate when we ate it, we're also poor judges of what's healthy and what's not. So rather than jumping to self-diagnose, see a doctor. And stick to the science.",because they've changed their diet
2528,"As you may have heard by now, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will enter the general election as the two most disliked major presidential candidates in modern history. But just what effect will that have on voters? A new Reuters/Ipsos survey shines some light on the answer, and it's not pretty: Nearly half of both Trump and Clinton supporters say their primary motivation isn't putting their preferred candidate in the White House — it's keeping the other one out of it. While the percentages are roughly comparable, that doesn't mean the number of people planning to vote against Clinton (as opposed to voting for Trump) is the same as the number who plan to vote against Trump (as opposed to voting for Clinton). Hillary leads in a still-technically hypothetical general election matchup with the celebrity billionaire by about 9 points in Reuters' tracking poll, suggesting there are considerably more not-him voters out there than not-her ones at the moment — something that makes sense given that for all of Clinton's many problems, she's not a dangerously unstable demagogue who wears a gold-plated fig leaf emblazoned with the words ""unpredictability"" and ""winner"" on it. Still, the sizes of both of those numbers are striking. To be fair, the general dislike of both candidates can be explained partly by negative partisanship, which has been increasing for some time. In 2014, Pew researchers found that over the past two decades the share of both Republicans and Democrats who have a very unfavorable opinion of the other party has more than doubled (from 17 percent to 43 percent for Republicans, and from 16 percent to 38 percent for Democrats). And those numbers understate just how passionately those intense partisans feel about the opposing side. Among those who stated a very unfavorable opinion, a clear majority said that the other party is a ""threat to the nation's well being."" If you think that, it's easy to see why you would be more fearful of the other party's nominee than you are hopeful about your own. Still, that the current state of electoral politics — as polarized as they are — doesn't entirely explain just how unpopular Trump and Clinton are among voters right now. If it did, you'd expect the number of Americans who strongly dislike him or her to largely be offset by a corresponding number of those who strongly like him or her. But, as FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten demonstrated, that's not the case. Since 1980, even the most unpopular nominees didn't head into the general election with a net-strong favorability rating — that is, the percentage with a ""strongly favorable"" minus the percentage with a ""strongly unfavorable"" one — below negative-10. Clinton's, though, is currently roughly twice that, while Trump's is more than four times it. (Hillary should thank the electoral heavens every morning that she's up against someone who cancels out so many of her weaknesses.) It also stands to reason that the ranks of both competing oh-good-god-anybody-but-him/her camps will grow during the six long and nasty months between now and Election Day. Those anti-Trump primary voters who end up voting Republican in November anyway will almost certainly do it to keep Clinton out of the White House. Similarly, many of the Bernie Sanders diehards who ultimately come around to Hillary will probably do so first and foremost in the name of stopping the Donald. A contest between two candidates who are so disliked, then, could come down to which one can do a better job of convincing Americans of the dangers of their rival. On that front, Hillary seems to have a sizeable head start. © 2016 Slate",it's keeping the other one out
2531,"The Gold Star father of Capt. Humayun Khan, who blasted President-elect Donald J. Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, told Breitbart News that he has ""no animosity"" towards Trump, though he still opposes Trump’s policies. ""I really have no animosity towards him, but towards his policies? Yes,"" said Khizr Khan, a attorney and supporter of Hillary R. Clinton in the last presidential election. ""If he says: ‘We must reconcile. We will treat all citizens equally in all of this and there is no discrimination based on religion or race and all that’ I will support him,"" Khan said. ""My country, my nation is divided, needs reconciliation, and nobody is taking that step,"" he said. ""I am just amazed that after winning the election, I was hoping that Donald Trump or his surrogates would take pro-active steps to hearten people, to remove the divide, to take certain pro-active steps–public steps, statements, actions that would hearten the entire country and remove the divide,"" he said. Throughout the campaign, amid news stories of Islamic terror attacks overseas and at home, Trump took a skeptical line towards Islam, noting how often the ideology has been tied to murderous attacks. In December in 2015, following the mass murder of 14 Americans by two Muslims in San Bernardino, California, Trump cited data showing ""great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population,"" and called for a temporary halt to the awarding of Green Cards to Muslims living in Islamic countries ""until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on."" Islamic advocacy groups sharply oppose limits on the migration of Muslims into the United States. Those groups include the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which Khan aided recently by hosting a Dec. 17 fundraiser. CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in a Hamas-funding operation.  U.S. court documents and news reports show that at least five of CAIR’s associates — either board members, employees or former employees — have been jailed or repatriated for various financial and terror-related offenses. Khan was in the audience for Wednesday’s confirmation hearing for Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.), Trump’s nominee for attorney general — a nomination that Khan opposes. The attorney did not call attention to himself as he passed the harried reporters just outside the Kennedy Caucus Room. On his brown trench coat he wore a small pin with the ""Big Red One"" shoulder patch of the Ist Infantry Division, the division his son was serving with when he was killed in Baqubah, Iraq, in 2004. Although, he did not testify, Khan released an open letter Monday critical of Sessions and what Khan said was his lack of support for voting rights. ""There is no constitutional principle or American value that is strengthened by making it harder for some Americans, especially those who are already disadvantaged, to exercise their right to vote,"" he wrote. ""People around the world look to our Constitution with envy, they are inspired by its promise of equal protection of the law to everyone–not just people from powerful families, or a favored ethnic group or religious community."" In the letter Khan wrote that three decades ago, senators were correct when they voted down President Ronald W. Reagan’s attempt to put Sessions on the federal bench. ""His record since then does not give us any reason to believe that those senators were in error."" Khan told Breitbart News he does not know Sessions personally, so he does not want to weigh in on his character. ""All I know is his voting record as a senator and then the statements he made yesterday,"" he said. Sessions came before the Senate Judiciary Committee for two days of hearings, Monday and Tuesday, and Khan said he took note that Sessions testified that as attorney general he would not support a ban on all Muslims entering the country, surveillance of mosques, or a registry for individuals identifying as Muslim. ""I am a patriotic American Muslim, so yesterday it was heartening to hear him say this,"" Khan said. The question for Khan is whether Sessions and Trump now agree, he said. Khan said he knows that Sessions has the votes to be confirmed by the Senate, but the hearings were an opportunity for people to air their concerns.",Exclusive–Khizr Khan: ‘I Really Have No Animosity Towards’ President-Elect Trump

2535,"For many of us, childhood was a carefree time of little responsibility with plenty of opportunity for play and exploration. However, the situation isn’t quite the same for today’s kids, who often find themselves dealing with hours of homework each week, extensive testing in school and extra-curricular activities as well. Over half has shown signs of depression Research into children’s wellbeing suggests that today’s kids are more anxious than those of generations past. What’s more is that this has ramifications not only on their academic success and overall happiness, but also on their health. Dr. Stuart Slavin, a professor based at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, believes that excessive emphasis on academic success has resulted in an unprecedented epidemic of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Dr. Slavin undertook a survey in which he asked 1400 students from Irvington High School, Silicon Valley, about their mental wellbeing. He administered two commonly-used tools for assessing mental health, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. He was shocked to discover that over half of the participants showed signs of moderate or severe depression, and over three-quarters struggled with anxiety. Furthermore, these figures may not even tell the full story because some of these students missed the opportunity to take the survey, in order to sit and write school exams. Teenagers feel as stressed as adults Traditionally, high-pressure academic environments and resulting mental health issues were thought to be the preserve of elite institutions attended by middle and upper-class students. However, it appears that young people of every socioeconomic background are impacted by the ever-increasing demands placed upon them. A study of over 1,000 teenagers carried out by the American Psychological Association showed that although they may officially have fewer responsibilities, teenagers feel as stressed as adults, especially during the school year. Continuous pressure to maintain high grades can also exert a negative impact on a child’s physical health. Medical science has long known of the connection between pressure, stress and various ailments in adults, but increasingly children and teens are also showing signs of illness caused by prolonged anxiety. Dr. Lawrence Rosen, a paediatrician based in New Jersey, has called attention to the increasing numbers of children he sees in his clinics with stress-related issues including stomach ulcers and migraines. These early life experiences are training children to accept high stress levels as inevitable and normal. The current generation of children are learning that the cost of success is illness, and they are likely to carry this unhealthy attitude with them as they move on to adulthood. What can concerned parents do? To avoid subjecting your child to undue stress, focus on affirming them for who they are rather than what you may wish for them to be. Each child has their own special mix of talents and abilities, so find out what your child is good at and praise them accordingly rather than dwelling on their weaknesses. Moreover, children should be given regular, unstructured free-time, in which they can relax and learn to entertain themselves. This teaches them that they do not need to concern themselves only with academic or professional success, and that they need not rely on others to schedule entertaining activities for them. Finally, children should also be taught that moral character and making a positive contribution to the wider world is just as important as academic success. Parents can model this behavior, and encourage their children to become well-rounded citizens. Get An Awesome Life I'm in!

There is the upcoming film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which explores this familiar universe in a different time and place. And then there is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the ambitious stage play sequel to the original series currently dominating the London theater scene that Warner Bros. says Thebooks and film series may be over, but‘s Wizarding World continues to live on. There are the short stories and essays published on Pottermore. There is the upcoming film, which explores this familiar universe in a different time and place. And then there is, the ambitious stage play sequel to the original series currently dominating the London theater scene that Warner Bros. says won’t get a film adaptation anytime soon (but go ahead and ask them again in ten years). So when someone asks film series star, Daniel Radcliffe, if he’d be willing to reprise his role as Harry Potter for a new movie, it’s all theoretical. But let’s face it – chances are strong you’re curious about what he says. It’s okay. You’re only human, and a Muggle at that. Radcliffe was in attendance at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was the recipient of the Rising Star Award, and The Hollywood Reporter asked him the big question. Would he say no to another Harry Potter movie down the line? His answer is diplomatic and the exact kind of response you’d expect from a young actor who has grown up carefully navigating the spotlight: I’m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do. But I think I’ll be happy enough and secure enough to let someone else play it. [...] At the moment it’s not even a concern because I’m too young to play the character, but even in 10 years’ time I would still feel strange about going back to it. [...] There’s a part of me that’s like, some things are better left untouched. If we went back to Potter, there’s a chance we’d make what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was to the original Star Wars, but there’s also the chance that we’d make Phantom Menace. So I don’t want to go back to anything like that and maybe sour what people have already loved. In other words, he’d do it as long as it doesn’t stink (a prospect easier said than done). He also adds that Jamie Parker, who plays the older Harry in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on stage, could easily play the character on film. I really liked reading the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ( and have written all about its similarities to Star Wars: The Force Awakens ) and think it’s teeming with cinematic potential. However, a quickly produced film adaptation leaves a lot of money on the table. It’s why you won’t see a Hamilton movie for a long, long time. As long as a stage play is still packing houses and generating demand, you don’t make a film version that lets everyone see it. That’s just basic business. Daniel Radcliffe isn’t taking the thought of another Potter movie seriously yet and neither should you. Besides, Radcliffe is quickly becoming one of our most brave and ambitious actors, playing magical corpses in movies like Swiss Army Man and neo-Nazis in Imperium. Let’s give him some space. Plus, a new Harry Potter movie starring the original cast would be far more satisfying if we wait another decade to let the actors properly age into their older selves.",I’m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do.
2540,"(This story has been updated with quotes from the contestant.) Did the massively popular game show ""Wheel of Fortune"" cheat a contestant out of a chance to win a million dollars? That’s what some are wondering after what happened recently on the show. It appears that a curious pronunciation of the phrase ""Corner Curio Cabinet"" is at the center of the controversy. That’s because recent contestant Paul Atkinson landed on the tiny million-dollar slice of the wheel, correctly guessed there were a some Cs in the puzzle, and then decided to solve it. The only problem? He pronounced it ""Corno curo cabinet."" The Wheel of Fortune rules clearly state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle. So host Pat Sajak had to break the bad news to Paul. ""Well, it’s one of those– it just didn’t come out the way you intended it to,"" Sajak told a flummoxed Atkinson after the next contestant immediately solved the puzzle. ""Paul, you’ve proved what several players have proven and I prove almost on a nightly basis: Sometimes your mouth says what your brain doesn’t intend for it to,"" Sajak later said. ABC reports that the unlucky Atkinson claimed he had never seen the word before and that may have contributed to his mispronunciation, ""I was nervous! I’ve got Pat freaking Sajak to my immediate right ... I’ve got lights and cameras in my face ..."" Calling it his ""biggest nightmare,"" Atkinson continued, ""I knew I messed up,"" he said. ""I knew something awesome could’ve happened, but I totally goofed it."" The clip from the episode is popping up online and people are weighing in on both sides of the argument: It should be pointed out that this was not a million dollar puzzle, however. If the judges had accepted Paul’s pronunciation, he would not have instantly won a million dollars. Solving that one puzzle and beating the other two contestants would have moved him to the bonus round where the $100,000 marker on the wheel is replaced by a one million dollar card. To win the big bucks, Paul would have still needed to spin the wheel, land on the million, and correctly solve the final puzzle. And this is not the first time something like this has happened. Perhaps you recall a similar story from December of last year. A contestant named ""Renee"" believed that she had correctly solved puzzle seen below: However, instead of saying ""Seven Swans A-Swimming"" – the contestant dropped the ""g"" in Swimming saying, ""Seven Swans A-Swimmin.'"" Host Pat Sajak had to break the bad news to Renee and basically handed the win to the next contestant. A few minutes later, Sajak explained that Renee had used ""the vernacular"" pronunciation in her answer, and that’s a no-no on Wheel of Fortune. Watch that clip: Do you think this was fair?

2543,"Arnold Schwarzenegger and his crew got chased by an elephant in South Africa. Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger got chased by an elephant in South Africa. The Terminator star - who was in the country to promote the multi-sport festival and expo Arnold Classic Africa 2016 - had a terrifying encounter with the mammal when it blocked the road in front of his group's car, before walking around the vehicle and chasing it as it drove away, reported femalefirst.co.uk. He shared a video of the incident on YouTube on Tuesday and wrote, ""I couldn't have written this safari encounter better if it was a movie"". The clip shows the driver shutting off the engine to avoid scaring the elephant, but when he turns the car back on the animal, it bellowed and backed away. One passenger was heard asking, ""Is he backing up because of the engine?"" The driver tried to reassure his passengers by saying he is worried about the animal scratching the vehicle, but Schwarzenegger, 68, replied, ""No, he's going to charge us"". As the car sped away with the elephant behind, the actor could be heard exclaiming, ""Oh s**t"". While the encounter was nerve-wracking for those in the car, the former Governor of California went on to stress how much he is ""in awe"" of elephants. I'm absolutely in awe of these beautiful animals, and I wish people would stop killing them for their ivory. ""I'm absolutely in awe of these beautiful, strong animals, even though some of us had to change our pants after this,"" Schwarzenegger wrote. ""We need to stop killing them - take a photo, not a shot. Would you rather be able to experience these creatures or a hunk of ivory? I thought so,"" he added.",some of us had to change our pants after this
2545,"If there’s one thing I’m insecure about, it’s my undereye circles. They’re right there on my face, reminding me of all the times I’ve had trouble falling asleep (there have been many). To combat this, I’ve tried my hardest to go to bed an hour, two hours early. I’ve taken naps. I’ve upped my water intake and have even given various undereye creams a try. Yet, no matter how hard I try, these dark, puffy rings under my eyes never seem to budge. That’s why I was more than willing to try something new and different: A coffee undereye mask! The Ingredients: In a YouTube video posted by Simplecare Products, the above three ingredients were recommended for an undereye mask of sorts (one that must be used consistently, since it’s not a permanent solution). According to the description, the coffee is anti-inflammatory, the peppercorns help with circulation, the coconut oil is meant to release and hold the coffee and peppercorn oils, and a bit of water is used to help transport nutrients into the skin. After mixing equal parts of these three kitchen items together, one is meant to leave the mask on for 5-10 minutes before gently washing the mixture off with a soft cloth. Personally, I didn’t feel comfortable putting a ton of peppercorns on my sensitive skin, so I used just a pinch. In the video, it is said that you should adjust the measurements to suit your skin type, so that’s exactly what I did. Day 1 After washing the undereye mask off the night prior, my eye area felt much more hydrated than normal. This feeling continued into the next day and, though I didn’t notice any physical differences, I have to admit that my undereye area didn’t feel as puffy and tired. Day 2 I had trouble sleeping and you can definitely see the exhaustion underneath my eyes. Even the coffee eye mask couldn’t combat the fact that I was tired (and probably dehydrated). My eye area no longer felt moisturized and the puffiness returned with a vengeance. Day 3 The puffiness definitely went down a notch on Day 3, but I still didn’t notice any major differences. If anything, I feel that getting more sleep is what helped the puffiness go down. As for the darkness under my eyes, it’s definitely still there. Day 4 On Day 4, I noticed that the lines directly underneath my bottom lashes were more pronounced. Maybe because the coffee undereye mask was too heavy and was stretching my skin? Maybe because I was still being affected by my lack of sleep? At this point, I began to dislike the mask, especially since it was taking up time and I felt as though it wasn’t really doing anything special. Day 5 My undereye region wasn’t as dark on this day, but once again, I credit that to the amount of sleep I got the night before. As time went on, I also noticed that the undereye mask wasn’t tightening or hydrating my skin as much as it did on the first day. Day 6 Still no difference. However, when washing the mask off the night before, I began to feel warmth underneath my eye – because there were more pepper kernels in the mix I used. I wonder if this was a good thing or bad thing? Maybe it helped my circulation some? Day 7 From this angle, you can see that my undereye circles are still there and as puffy as they were on Day 1. Luckily, the lines beneath my lashes weren’t as noticeable as they were on Day 4, but the darkness was just as, well... dark as ever. The Verdict While I find the concept to be interesting, I don’t feel that this mask actually improved the condition of my undereye circles. On the first day, I definitely felt something, but I think that’s because I have sensitive skin and it was trying to adjust to this new product. Otherwise, what actually helped was the amount of sleep I got throughout the week. I noticed that my undereyes felt and looked better when I was sleeping regularly, which is something I feel no mask can live up to.","While I find the concept to be interesting, I don’t feel that this mask actually improved the condition of my undereye circles.

2547,"""Lucy,"" a truly iconic, prehistoric hominin fossil, is one of the most well-known scientific discoveries of our time, and for good reason. Known as Australopithecus afarensis , this 1974 Ethiopian find will be best remembered for revealing that she could walk upright – albeit somewhat inefficiently – meaning that bipedalism evolved at least 3.18 million years ago in our own species’ evolutionary lineage A remarkable new Nature study has shed some additional light on Lucy’s demise. Despite being one of the most complete fossilized hominin skeletons ever found, it’s not been entirely clear how she died, making her one of the oldest cold cases in prehistory. After a painstaking analysis of all her fractures, however, it appears she died falling out of a tree, outstretching her arms in an attempt to save herself as she took her final tumble. ""Up until this time, no one had ever before proposed a cause of death for Lucy,"" lead author John Kappelman , professor of hominoid paleobiology and evolution at the University of Texas at Austin, told IFLScience. As fascinating as this is by itself, it also appears to confirm something that some researchers have hypothesized for a while now: Lucy wasn’t just a ground-walker, but arboreal – a tree-climber. Her death, therefore, probably came about because, unlike her ancestors, she could not climb trees as well anymore, and slipped and fell. ""Our new hypothesis offers indirect support for this idea,"" Kappelman added. ""How much time, and how frequently did the climbing occur, well, we don’t know at present. But let’s assume for a moment that Lucy did nest in the trees at night to avoid predators, just as chimpanzees do."" Lucy's distal radius (wrist) undergoes X-ray (CT) scanning.

2550,"GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan loves to pretend that the GOP doesn’t have a race problem. The 2012 autopsy report from the spectacular loss of the Romney/Ryan ticket to President Obama and Vice President Biden had a lot of so-called ""minority outreach"" goals. Clearly, none of those goals have been accomplished. After all, the current GOP standard-bearer, Donald Trump, has run a campaign that is steeped in racism. He kicked off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, he has called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, has called women fat pigs and dogs, and accused Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly of being menstrual when called out on this, and a whole host of other things that play to the bigotry that is so inherent in the current incarnation of the GOP. All of that aside though, there is one very telling photo making the rounds on the internet that perfectly illustrates just how, well WHITE the Republican Party is, despite the wide range of diversity that makes up the actual country. It’s a priceless selfie of Paul Ryan showcasing himself with bunches of young republicans, and you won’t see one face of color in that grand sea of white. (Editor’s Note: Yes, technically there are a few. I count three. This was meant to be a joke to highlight the GOP’s diversity problem, not a hard count.) For your viewing pleasure (or disgust) here is the tweet of that photo: I think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie. #SpeakerSelfie. A photo posted by Speaker Paul Ryan (@speakerryan) on Jul 16, 2016 at 11:12am PDT Then again, this is, on the whole, how GOP lawmakers and voters alike want their party to be, no matter what they say to the contrary. They’ve had opportunities to change, they just won’t. It’s no wonder, then, that the Republican nominee for president currently sits with historically low popularity with minority groups. In the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for example, a recent poll found Trump has an astonishing ZERO percent support from African Americans. Pollsters couldn’t find a single black person who said they would be voting for Trump in November. That is staggering. So these smiling young Republicans may be the future of the GOP – but they certainly aren’t the future of America.",you won’t see one face of color
2551,"You’re probably wondering what’s taking Valve, a company with nigh-infinite resources, forever to make Half-Life 2: Episode 3. Or you’ve given up on that and you believe it’s going to be called Half-Life 3. The sad truth is that we will never see another Half-Life game from Valve, and for one very good reason: its most important character is dead. ""But, Doc,"" I hear you saying, ""Gordon Freeman is alive and well!"" While this is true, I have another shocking revelation to make: Gordon Freeman is not the most important person in Half-Life! Incredible but true. So, wait, let me back up and talk about Half-Life, which is the third-greatest shooter of all time after Halo: Combat Evolved and Quake, which are tied for first place. Half-Life’s greatness comes from two distinct elements. The first, which everyone has talked about since it was released 18 years ago, is how Half-Life feels real. At the time, it was an incredible feat, and all these years later, it still is. Despite the aging graphics, my journeys through Black Mesa always feel as real and vibrant as they did the day I first played Half-Life, back in 2007. The other, more important element is the way Half-Life motivates you. See, one of the things that enhanced the realism were the game’s other characters. Sure, they were two-dimensional stick figures, but they showed up when it mattered. As the game opens, they’re kind of mean to you; you get the sense that people resent Gordon’s presence. It characterizes Gordon too: he seems to be perpetually late, and nobody seems to value his skills all that much—his job amounts to ""push a cart into a very dangerous energy beam."" Apparently, they didn’t want to risk anyone else doing it, because they made everyone wait until he showed up to do it. As Half-Life progresses, people bestow upon you more and more responsibility. Go get help. Kill the giant monster. Go meet the scientists at the Lambda Complex. By the time you get there, the scientists have gone from ""ugh, Gordon,"" to ""Gordon, we’ve been watching you on the monitors, and we believe in you."" What’s great about this is how it all feels earned. Gordon has gone from a dope nobody likes to a guy who, through the experiences in the game itself, is a hardcore survivor and all around action hero. It’s silent character development, and a huge aspect of Half-Life’s appeal. Gordon’s journey isn’t just geographical, it’s emotional. Sponsored Half-Life 2 is terrible. Within minutes, other characters are fangirling over you, like they knew you or something. Why? Because you left a secret base shortly before a nuclear explosion. Seriously, there were no witnesses to your defeat of the Nihilanth at the end of Half-Life, and even if there were, they should, reasonably, object to what you did, because in Half-Life 2, apparently the Nihilanth wasn’t so much a bad guy as a rebel against the Combine, the actual bad guys in the Half-Life 2 universe. We could get into a whole big thing about why this is a bad decision, from game design to lore perspectives, but that would be an article the length of a novel, and nobody has time for that. Instead, let’s talk about Eli Vance. The first real objective you receive in Half-Life 2 is to go meet Eli at Black Mesa East. Why? Because Eli is the Resistance leader, and he will tell you why you’re here. So, okay, Eli’s an important bigwig in the Resistance, but does that really make him the most important character? Yes. See, Half-Life 2 uses Eli as a tool. First, you go to Black Mesa East to find out Why You Are Here. Then, when Black Mesa East is attacked (no one in the Resistance assumes that you, the new guy, might have had something to do with it), Eli is taken, and your next goal is... to get out of Ravenholm, find the Resistance, and go rescue Eli. This time, he’s in a prison called Nova Prospekt. Cool, so you set out across the beach to go get Eli back. When you get to Nova Prospekt, you watch as Judith Mossman, the rebel traitor, kidnaps Eli. Just to be clear, this is the third time you chase after Eli. Only this time, the teleporter malfunctions, and you don’t just jump through space, you jump through time. When your teleport ends, you find yourself something like two weeks in the future, and the rebellion has started. The reason for this? Because ""Gordon Freeman,"" if that is his name, ""disappeared with Alyx, Judith, and Eli."" So. Let me get this straight. A 27 year-old guy shows up almost 20 years after he disappeared, without having aged, and his appearance heralds an attack on the Resistance base that sees its most important member, daughter, and assistant kidnapped. Nobody knows Judith is a traitor, because only you, Alyx, and Eli, who were all in Nova Prospekt know this. Most rebels, I’m betting, are pretty paranoid, which is what’s kept them alive for so long. Most paranoid people I know would see all the evidence and assume this ""Gordon Freeman"" character is an impostor whose sole purpose was to destroy the Rebellion’s leadership. The characters in Half-Life 2 decide that everyone’s disappearance is a signal to attack, so they attack. Without you. They’ve been carrying on a war against the Combine while you were gone. Apparently they could have done this without you—or any of their leadership, really—so there seems to be no clear motive for attacking at this juncture rather than at any other, and they seem to be doing a pretty good job on their own. Your job, of course, is to rescue Eli. So you rush to the top of the tower, get to Eli, defeat the bad guy, and... the game freezes. It picks up again in Half-Life 2: Episode 1, which comes in two halves. The first half is about a bunch of boring puzzles starring energy balls. Your motive? Delay the self-destruction of the Citadel, allowing Eli and friends to escape the city. The second half is about you getting to a train and fleeing the city before the Citadel explodes and kills everyone. That and plugging holes to stop those irritating ant-lions from spawning. Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is broken up into three sections. In the first section, you save Eli’s daughter. In the second section, you escort Eli’s daughter to Eli. In the third section, you attempt to defend Eli, who promises to finally tell you what he was going to tell you, presumably, after you toyed with the gravity gun that was something like twelve years ago. AND HE DIES. So, to recap: Half-Life was about you proving yourself to other people, a personal journey as you attempted to escape from a bad case of Science Gone Wrong and Government Coverups. Half-Life 2 was about spending all your time trying to get to Eli while everyone masturbates your ego, presumably to disguise the fact that you’re nothing but a glorified errand boy, whose only purpose is to do things that help Eli out, and then the guy just straight up DIES on you, and now you’re stuck. You know what? I think the problem is that Valve never really knew why you were there. I think they never really had anything beyond ""go fight some Combine."" Most narratives set up their conflicts pretty fast. Star Wars took a little while to get to the Death Star, but the first movie was about character growth and stopping the Empire from killing everyone with the Death Star. Half-Life 2 doesn’t have any of that. Half-Life did. It just strings you along while everyone tells you about what a great guy you are the entire time. Half-Life is one of the greatest games of all time, because it made you earn your place. Half-Life 2 isn’t, because it doesn’t. There are plenty of other reasons for it; ex-Valve employees have complained about the studio’s structure. Viktor Antonov, the art designer who made Half-Life 2 so distinct and went on to help create Dishonored, said that Valve stopped making AAA games. I’ve heard other, similar statements from time to time. But at the end of the day, we’ll never see Half-Life 3 because Eli Vance is Princess Peach, now that Princess Peach is dead, there’s no one left for Mario to save. Edit: I accidentally a word. And I accidentalied a sentence too. It’s fixed now. Tweaked the headline.",its most important character is dead
2558,"If the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, why do rivers meander their way towards a larger body of water? Today, we answer this question with help from MinuteEarth. In states like Nevada, Washington and Vermont, a river’s course is determined by the mountainous structures surrounding it. Like MinuteEarth mentions, these rivers ""are literally set it stone."" But, in states like Indiana and the Great Plains, river banks made of soft soil can easily shift and change a river’s course. According to MinuteEarth, all it takes is a little disturbance and a lot of time. It's a good thing nature has plenty of both.  If one bank of a river is disturbed and begins to crumble, water fills the hole and sweeps away loose dirt. Over time, this creates a bigger and bigger hole in the river bank. As the water begins to rush faster through the new opening, it slows on the opposite river bank. Because slow-moving water can’t carry as much weight as fast-moving water, loose dirt and rocks build up on that side, making it more shallow. Eventually, the build-up creates new land and a new curve in the river’s watercourse. The new curve causes the water running against the outside bank to pick up enough momentum that it slams into the opposite bank further down the river, creating another curve. As more time passes, the rushing water creates more and more curves downstream.  Even though the wider the river, the longer the distance is to the next curve, MinuteEarth explains that the creation of these curves tends to happen in a similar pattern all over the world. Generally speaking, the length of one S-shaped curve is about six times the width of the river.  And, as long as nothing interferes, this process and pattern will continue, and the river will grow curvier and curvier.

2560,"As the dust settles on the EU referendum battleground, some 33 million voters await with bated breath to see what the victors will do now that the nation has spoken to leave. Political commentators forecast a dark future for the UK: Jeremy Corbyn has just sacked Hilary Benn to head off a coup, and Boris Johnson could be prime minister come November. David Cameron’s decision to resign before enacting Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out how a country could leave the EU, may have much bigger implications for Conservative hopefuls eyeing up the Prime Minister's seat than they bargained for. While panic ensues, one person’s musings in the comments section of thehas an interesting hypothesis on these complications: If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost. Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron. With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership. How? Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice under Article 50 the morning after a vote to leave. Whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but, in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday, he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor. And as the day wore on, the enormity of that step started to sink in: the markets, Sterling, Scotland, the Irish border, the Gibraltar border, the frontier at Calais, the need to continue compliance with all EU regulations for a free market, re-issuing passports, Brits abroad, EU citizens in Britain, the mountain of legislation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew. The referendum result is not binding. It is advisory. Parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction. The Conservative party election that Cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it: will you, if elected as party leader, trigger the notice under Article 50? Who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders? Boris Johnson knew this yesterday, when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference. He has been out-manoeuvred and check-mated. If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over - Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession ... broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this. When he acts like the dumb blond it is just that: an act. The Brexit leaders now have a result that they cannot use. For them, leadership of the Tory party has become a poison chalice. When Boris Johnson said there was no need to trigger Article 50 straight away, what he really meant to say was ""never"". When Michael Gove went on and on about ""informal negotiations"" ... why? why not the formal ones straight away? ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure. They both know what a formal demarche would mean: an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take.","If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished.

2561,"It was already known the region is sinking, but now NASA has revealed it is happening at higher rate than previously thought. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought. Using airborne radar to map the rate at which the ground is sinking over a period of a few years, they were able to document in fine detail exactly which regions are most at risk, and where planning and building needs to be monitored. The Earth’s surface can sink due to a mixture of natural and man-made causes. The weight of deposited sediment can, for example, cause subsidence, as can the movement of glaciers and the compaction of shallow sediments. But humans can also influence this process by pumping out oil and gas, or in the example of New Orleans, by the withdrawal of water. The extraction of groundwater and dewatering of the region, in which surface water is removed in order to prevent standing water or saturated earth, is causing the city to sink. This has been exasperated by the building of levees, which prevent the natural build-up of sediment that counteract the sinking. The region of Norco is one of the worst affected, sinking 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. NASA/JPL-Caltech, Esri This is most acute in regions upriver along the Mississippi River, specifically the industrial areas of Norco and Michoud, where the ground is sinking by a worrying 5 centimeters (2 inches) per year. Other areas of concern were in New Orleans Upper and Lower 9th Ward, where the subsidence may be related to the water levels of the Mississippi. Of particular concern is the changes in ground level around the levees built to prevent flooding, as they found regions behind the levees sinking by 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) a year. The data used by NASA to build the maps, published in a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was created using NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), which is able to track changes in elevation on the Earth’s surface down to a centimeter difference. This by itself can’t tell the researchers what is causing the change in ground level, so they then have to disentangle all the possible causes, which operate at different time and space scales. While the fact that the region is sinking is not new, NASA have highlighted that the degree to which it is happening is much greater than previously thought, and that it could be putting certain regions at a much greater risk of flooding, as if there wasn’t a big enough one to begin with. It is hoped that the data can be used to attempt to reduce or reverse the subsidence in the most severely affected areas, as well as help with planning decisions for the future.",NASA has confirmed that New Orleans and the surrounding areas are sinking at a much higher rate than previously thought

2574,"During my last vacation, I watched an insane documentary about the Nazis' extensive amphetamine use and Adolf Hitler's drug addiction. The film made an incredible claim: that Hitler killed himself because his doctor cut off his amphetamine supply. This theory sounded crazy — I had to look into it — but when I got back to work, I couldn't find the documentary. I wondered whether I had entered some type of twilight zone (cruise ships have pretty strange channels). But my parents saw it too — we couldn't have all imagined the same thing. At first glance, I thought it was the 2014 BBC documentary ""Hitler's Hidden Drug Habit: Secret History."" But I watched the whole thing, and the filmmakers made no mention of this wild can't-get-drugs suicide theory. To be clear, though: Yes, Hitler was very, very into drugs. Variousscholarshaveoutlinedhisextensivesubstanceuse. His personal physician, Dr. Theodor Morell, pumped him full of all sorts of treatments, from nerve tonics to Pervitin, a type of amphetamine common in Germany at the time. Morell's personal journals list 74 medications that he gave the führer, according to the BBC documentary, sometimes administering up to 20 injections a day. The floor of Hitler's bunker where he spent his last days was also said to be littered with medications when researchers entered it years later. There was apparently a rift between Hitler and his doctor in the days before his death. Morell fled the country, and then on April 30, 1945, Hitler killed himself. But would a lack of access to Morell's cache of drugs explain why Hitler did it? There are simpler explanations for Hitler taking his own life — the fact that he was rapidly losing the war, for one. I tried to find other people who had seen the same documentary I had and came across just one person on Twitter: Theory that Hitler committed suicide due to withdrawal from crystal meth?! Hoo lawdy. pic.twitter.com/13jjGCn7mt — Kasia K (@PolPrairieMama) May 17, 2016 @HarringtonBecca America's Greatest Monuments? I watched on Smithsonian channel. @smithsonian maybe knows where to watch it? — Kasia K (@PolPrairieMama) June 2, 2016 But ""America's Greatest Monuments"" didn't pan out. I ultimately contacted a few researchers who were involved in the BBC documentary to see whether they had heard of the suicide theory. Sarah Bailey, a pharmacologist at the University of Bath, expressed strong doubts to Tech Insider: ""It is clear from the documents of the time that Hitler's medicines were numerous and wide ranging. However, it is not clear how much or how frequently these medicines were given. As a pharmacologist, we have to be careful that the dose of any medicine determines whether it may have a medicinal effect rather than a toxic effect. ""It is documented that Hitler took amphetamine (not methamphetamine which is chemically slightly different, more addictive and faster acting). However this did not appear to be routinely in use and we do not know how frequently or how much he was given. Many other medicines appeared to have been given more routinely. ""From the information we had in preparation for making this film, it is too limited to make any conclusions. My personal feeling is that Hitler was not a meth addict but was an experimental subject for many of Dr Morrell's ideas about medicines."" The clearest condemnation of this crazy theory came from Sir Richard J. Evans, a historian who has extensively studied World War II and the Third Reich. Evans directed me toward an essay he wrote in a recent book of his titled, ""Was Hitler Ill?"" In it, he outlines how considering whether Hitler was insane or sick is a futile endeavor: ""Hitler was not insane or deranged, or suffering from drug-induced delusions,"" he writes, ""or laboring under the effects of some chronic disease such as syphilis, or acting in an unresolved hypnotic trance: on the contrary, he was sane according to any reasonable definition of the term, and fully responsible for his actions."" In response to the idea that Hitler killed himself because his amphetamine injections were cut off, Evans was unwavering: ""I'm afraid this is complete rubbish,"" he told Tech Insider in an email. But the most convincing argument came from Roland Jones, a colleague of Bailey's at University of Bath. Jones said he agreed with Bailey's assessment and added that if Hitler wanted to get amphetamine, ""he could easily have obtained it elsewhere."" After all, he was Hitler. So while we'll label this theory debunked for now, questions about that enigmatic documentary remain. Why would someone make a documentary about it? And where did the filmmakers' evidence come from?","In response to the idea that Hitler killed himself because his amphetamine injections were cut off, Evans was unwavering: ""I'm afraid this is complete rubbish,"""
2575,"By Natalie Burg Hewlett-Packard was a business born of and built on innovation. The tech company is among those famous early Silicon Valley businesses founded by a couple of brilliant guys tinkering in a garage. New ideas continued to drive its growth   until they didn't. Organic growth keeps companies on the cutting edge, forcing them to continuously improve. More than a decade ago, Hewlett-Packard focused its expansion efforts on acquisitions, at the expense of investing in R&D. The company's subsequent struggles, noted observers, could be traced to the decision to stop innovating. There's nothing wrong with acquisitions or mergers, said Pontish Yeramyan, founder and CEO of performance consulting firm Gap International. The problem is when it becomes the only way to grow. Why Organic Growth Matters Organic growth keeps companies on the cutting edge, forcing them to continuously improve   whether that's adjusting their vision, innovating the business model or developing new products and services. It makes you more tuned in with the changing marketplace, Yeramyan said. You get more focused on what you want to do and how you want to lead the market. You end up getting caught off guard much less than companies focused on just getting bigger, being more efficient and delivering short-term results. Take the hotel industry. A decade ago hotels were just being hotels, Yeramyan said. They were growing the way they knew how: buying and merging with other hotels. Then Airbnb came along, reinventing the way people travel and disrupting the entire industry. It's becoming a familiar story. While legacy businesses are busy gobbling up smaller companies, some startup comes along and challenges their entire business model. A new survey of global executives by Forbes Insights and Gap International shows 57 percent of business leaders name startups as their biggest competitors. Leaders of established companies might worry less about being disrupted by a startup if they focused more on organic growth. When you're connected to organic growth and your passion is about growth, then you're busy innovating and being in front of the marketplace, rather than being victimized by change, Yeramyan said. When people connect to a passion for organic growth, it creates alignment and brings out the brilliance in employees, which, in turn, promotes more growth, according to Yeramyan. That's how organizations can produce the next Airbnb-like idea   rather than being caught off guard when it emerges. You become the changer, rather than the changee, she said. Breaking The Frame The Forbes Insights report found that 70 percent of respondents are extremely or somewhat concerned about whether their company will still be relevant and competitive in two years. Despite that deep concern, most business leaders unknowingly limit their thinking when it comes to organic growth. They tend to operate from fixed assumptions about how their marketplace works, viewing the world through what Yeramyan calls a frame. According to Yeramyan, people don't know they're always operating inside a frame because they see it as a fixed reality, as just the way it is. Because they don't think they're in a frame, they can't challenge it, she said. Commoditized products are a great example. It may be challenging for a leader of a commoditized business to create growth when margins are disappearing or demand for their product is down. Because their frame is we are a commodity business that can only compete on price, it's not obvious that there is another way to compete. Organic growth becomes possible when leaders can break themselves and their businesses out of that frame. They might say, 'Maybe we don't have to be a commodity; maybe something else is possible,' Yeramyan said. A bottle of water and a cup of coffee used to be commodities, until someone came along and decided to compete on something other than price. Tactics to create organic growth could include finding new kinds of customers, developing new products and services, or innovating internal processes   even how you build employees' capabilities to execute. It could be virtually anything. Once you break out of your frame, that's the fun part, Yeramyan said. Making It Happen When business leaders open their minds to new ways of growing, the stage may be set for organic growth, but the play hasn't even started yet. Yeramyan highlights three critical actions leaders must take to create sustainable growth from the inside: Get On The Same Page Organizations grow when all employees work together to achieve the same end. This happens only when leaders clarify and articulate their vision, and get everyone aligned on a plan to execute it. Too often, leaders share their vision and people nod their heads, and leaders think they have been understood. Then team members go off and execute in a way they think fulfills the leader's intention, but end up going in a very different direction. Leaders may have a whole different picture in their heads that their people can't understand unless they fully articulate it. Then, and only then, can an organization move forward together to execute a plan that realizes the vision. Break Down Silos The benefits of an entire organization working toward a common vision can be reached only when everyone is working in harmony. Yet invisible silos and legacy systems often keep departments, offices and divisions from collaborating. A whole new corporate culture may be required. But the rewards of true collaboration and cooperation   increases in the quality and speed of work   are well worth the effort. Grow People To Grow The Business An organization grows when its people grow. People grow when challenges require them to. But to push people to reach out of their comfort zones, the challenges can't be perfunctory. For organizations to be leading-edge, leaders, front-line staff and everyone in between must be challenged to deliver far beyond what they think they can. Achieving organic growth may take time and require investment and culture change, but according to the experts at Gap International, there can be no real, sustainable success without it. A former downtown development professional, Natalie Burg is a freelancer who writes about growth, entrepreneurialism and innovation.","Achieving organic growth may take time and require investment and culture change, but according to the experts at Gap International, there can be no real, sustainable success without it."

Turns out, most of the vitamins we need are Turns out, most of the vitamins we need are already present in the food we eat — or at least in the food we should be eating. That's possible because our bodies only need minuscule amounts of them to function properly. How miniscule, you ask?

But the amounts needed to prevent these horrific conditions is miniscule, as Price points out: The amount of folic acid that pregnant women are told to take to prevent devastating neurological defects in their babies is 240 micro grams a day, less than the weight of two grains of Morton salt. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D, without which you won't be able to properly absorb calcium and your bones will soften, is 15 micrograms, one-sixteenth of that for folic acid. And the RDA for B12, a citmain whose deficiency can cause depression, delusions, memory loss, incontinence, nerve damage, and in extreme cases life-threatening anemia, is smaller still, just 2.4 microrams — 0.0000024 grams. That's 1/100th the weight of the requirement for folic acid, the equivalent of 1/67th of one grain of salt. In developed countries, though, we often treat vitamins as a cure-all for everything from colds to fatigue. This is a big problem. Then solution to this problem, Price writes, is staggeringly simple: Eat better, and stop relying on a pill. As it turns out, most As it turns out, most green, leafy veggies are high in vitamins A, C, and E; colorful peppers and carrots are rich in vitamin A; fish and nuts are high in omega-3s; and avocados are a great source of potassium and vitamins C and E.

2587,"The fears surrounding ageing are twofold; there is the natural decline of the body and the spectre of a physiological disease like arthritis. There are also issues like memory loss and the decrease in cognitive functions to contend with. A small strata of society, referred to as ""superagers"" by neurologist Marsel Mesulam, not only retain their mental sharpness well into old age, but their cognitive abilities might even rival that of a healthy 25 year old. Neurologist Lisa Feldman Barrett and her team studied the brains of 17 of these 'superagers', and compared them with people of a similar age. Findings showed that the brain regions associated with emotion – like the midcingulate cortex and the anterior insula - were thicker in the superagers, and thinner for regular agers. They theorised these regions were responsible for their more alert state. Now for the question on everyone's lips: Barrett puts it simply as this: work hard at something. Characterising the brain as a muscle, the only way to make it strong is by consistently pushing it to its limits. The brain regions which are thicker in superagers are active when a person undergoes a difficult task that requires concentration, whether that is mental – like regularly playing chess, or solving difficult maths equations – or physical. For example, say you’ve signed up for a vigorous Muay Thai class that leaves you feeling physically exhausted: the more often you put your body through high levels of stress, the quicker it can build fitness, muscle and strength, and activities you previously found difficult will become easier. The same theory applies for your mind.","The brain regions which are thicker in superagers are active when a person undergoes a difficult task that requires concentration, whether that is mental – like regularly playing chess, or solving difficult maths equations – or physical."

2589,"Men who say their longest job was truck driving might face a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer, according to a new study. The findings, presented at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, also showed an association between working at a garden shop for at least six months and a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The study is based on data from 1,083 European-American and 1,049 African-American men who had recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The participants were asked about the job they most recently held before the diagnosis, as well as the occupation they spent the longest time working in during their lifetimes. They were also asked whether they had worked in a garden shop, as an animal caretaker, as an exterminator or as a landscaper for more than six months in their lives. While researchers did identify an association between working in a garden shop for more than six months and aggressive prostate cancer, as well as a long period of time spent working as a truck driver and aggressive prostate cancer, they did not find associations between work as an exterminator, landscaper or animal caretaker and aggressive prostate cancer. Study researcher L. Joseph Su, Ph.D., M.P.H., of the National Cancer Institute, also told HuffPost that construction workers and people who work in the financial industry -- such as accountants -- faced a higher aggressive prostate cancer risk. However, Su noted that the study is purely epidemiological and only shows an association between these occupations and aggressive prostate cancer risk. It does not prove that truck driving causes aggressive prostate cancer. There are several potential hypotheses that could explain the association, he said. For instance, other studies have shown possible links between whole-body vibrations and prostate risks. ""Truck drivers are on the road for a long period of time,"" Su said, and while this may not be as much the case with newer trucks, ""older trucks have a lot of vibration and bumping of the engine. Long-term vibration from the engine, which is right next to your prostate, for a long period of time,"" could potentially be a risk factor. Another possible factor, he noted, could be the lifestyle behaviors of people who drive trucks for a living. They might not be as physically active, for instance, or their diets may not be healthy due to the limited food options on the road. ""That's something that I plan to ... look at with my colleagues,"" Su said. While researchers for this study did track the study participants' diets, they only controlled for body mass index in the analysis.",higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer

2598,"Now the truth can be told. Eight years after being hailed for exemplary leadership in the face of disappointment, gymnast Shawn Johnson says the picture of her comforting teammate Alicia Sacramone at the Beijing Olympics isn’t quite what everyone thought it was. ""It’s incredibly embarrassing, but we were talking about Harry Potter,"" said Johnson, who is currently working as a Yahoo Sports Olympics analyst. ""It was always funny because people always wanted to ask me about this moment. About how I ‘brought the team together’ and how I ‘picked her back up.’ I never wanted to comment because it was so embarrassing."" View photos Shawn Johnson Alicia Sacramone More Team captain Sacramone had just made two crucial mistakes in the team competition — falling off the beam and during a pass in the floor exercise — that ended any chance the United States had at winning its first gold in team competition since 1996. Amid the disappointment, Johnson stepped in to give what looked like a few steadying words of encouragement. The team would end up winning a silver medal while Sacramone and Johnson took home a huge haul of medals during the individual competition. The media at the time interpreted the meeting between Johnson and Sacramone to fit an Olympic narrative of perseverance and goodwill. Sacramone looked as though she was on the edge of a cliff, holding back that inevitable moment when the disappointment in her falls on floor and beam would overwhelm her and plunge her headlong into tears. But Johnson smiled that smile that comes so easily for her, and took Sacramone’s arm in hers, almost as if they were an old married couple on a park bench. For a moment, however briefly, Sacramone smiled, too. No matter what Johnson does in two days’ time on the women’s all-around competition, I hope the world will remember that image – of a 16-year-old girl who is not only an extraordinary athlete, but also something altogether more profound and worthy of celebration: an uncommon human being. Johnson is an uncommon human being: An Olympic gold medalist who is friendly and has always carried herself well in a very bright spotlight. But at that moment she was just being a common 16-year-old girl. One who liked Harry Potter books and sharing inside jokes among friends. ""I remember walking straight up to {Sacramone) and I gave her a hug and I said ‘Too bad Shayla’s not here with her magic Harry Potter wand.'"" Shayla was Shayla Worley, a close friend and fellow top-ranked gymnast who didn’t make the Beijing Olympics after being hampered by an injury. According to Johnson, Worley was ""obsessed"" with the Harry Potter books and movies and would carry around wands to put spells on her others. Johnson keyed on that obsession to get Sacramone’s mind off her mistakes. ""It had nothing to do with the competition, it was just Harry Potter,"" Johnson said. While we’re clearing up misconceptions from those 2008 Olympics, Johnson said there was another media narrative at those Games that didn’t contain any truth. While the media busily pushed a rivalry between Nastia Liukin (""The Ballerina"") and Johnson (""The Energizer Bunny""), reality was something else. ""We were anything but rivals,"" Johnson said.

2604,"Grigory Rasputin, a mystic peasant who captivated the Russian imperial court, met his death at the hands of aristocratic enemies 100 years ago. Artem Krechetnikov of BBC Russian examines the grisly murder of Rasputin and finds that some details are more myth than reality. Few characters in Russian history are as well-known as the mystic from Tobolsk in Siberia, whose name is forever linked to scandal. He has been called a ""sex machine"" and ""lover"" of the Tsarina, Alexandra Feodorovna. The first description is probably an exaggeration, and the second is simply false. Russians' opinions of him, at the time and later, ranged from ""holy man"" to ""reptile"". The latter was how the reformist prime minister of the time, Pyotr Stolypin, contemptuously spoke of him. With the outbreak of war in 1914 there was hysteria about ""dark forces around the throne"". The Empress Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, believed Rasputin had mystical healing powers that could help her haemophiliac son Alexei, the heir to the throne. Supporters of Russia's alliance with France, keen to see Germany defeated militarily, suspected Rasputin of undermining Russia's foreign policy. In early 1914 Rasputin told an Italian journalist: ""God willing there won't be a war, and I'll get busy on that score."" Night rendezvous Mystery still shrouds Rasputin's last moments. Why did he go to the palace of Prince Felix Yusupov in St Petersburg? According to two of the assassins - Prince Yusupov and Vladimir Purishkevich, a member of parliament - Yusupov collected Rasputin on the night of 30 December 1916 on the pretext that his wife Irina wanted to meet him. But Irina was actually away at the Yusupovs' estate in Crimea. Yusupov claimed that he took Rasputin into a basement where he fed him cakes laced with poison. But Rasputin allegedly did not succumb, and kept asking to meet Irina upstairs. Yusupov's co-conspirators made lots of noise on the floor above, faking a party, and played the American song Yankee Doodle on the gramophone. But this version of history seems improbable. Political intrigues Rasputin was uneducated, but no fool. The Yusupovs were fabulously rich - Irina was a member of the royal family - so Rasputin could hardly have thought she would let herself be seduced so easily. According to Rasputin's daughter Maria, Russian Interior Minister Alexander Protopopov had warned Rasputin that there was a plot to kill him. He advised him to avoid socialising for a few days, but Rasputin told him ""it's too late"". So it remains a mystery why he visited the Yusupovs. It cannot have been just for the Madeira and jolly music. There were rumours that the Empress Alexandra and Protopopov were planning to dissolve parliament - the Duma - introduce a state of emergency and sue for peace. It was quite feasible for Yusupov to lure Rasputin by promising a meeting with allies of the empress. The rest of the assassins' account of what happened reads like the screenplay of a horror movie. After the poison allegedly failed to work, Yusupov had to open fire, but Rasputin rose up again, like a monster. Even blows to the temple failed to stop Rasputin, who pursued Yusupov out across the courtyard. Then allegedly Purishkevich fired four shots into Rasputin's back, felling him. So, what of the poisoned cakes? People who knew Rasputin well said he always refused sweet things, believing them to be harmful to his special powers. Guards questioned about the murder reported hearing about four shots, in quick succession. A pathologist determined the cause of death to be a shot to the stomach, causing heavy blood loss. No drowning There were contradictory testimonies about the shirt Rasputin was wearing. He may well have been killed before taking off his fur coat. The assassins probably killed him as soon as he stepped inside, shooting him at point-blank range. Five aristocrats, led by Prince Yusupov, were involved, though some speculate that even more participated in the plot. According to another myth, Rasputin's defiance of death was such that the plotters had to drown him in icy water. But the autopsy said: ""No evidence of drowning was found. Rasputin was already dead when he was thrown into the water."" Yusupov went into exile in Paris after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and lived to 80. Purishkevich was arrested in Petrograd in 1918, then released on the orders of secret police chief Felix Dzerzhinsky. He died of typhus in 1920, during the Russian civil war. The violence and chaos of the revolution and Bolshevik terror make Rasputin's words sound prophetic: ""Without me everything will collapse.""

2605,"You may have noticed that drinking alcohol can sometimes make your poop habits a little...shitty. If alcohol doesn't mess with your poops at all, consider yourself lucky. Maybe it happens while you're drinking, and you end up trapped in a bar bathroom praying for mercy. You know it's bad when you actually have to sit down on those gross toilets. ...or you spend the entire morning after on the toilet. Either way, alcohol poops are no fun. To get to the bottom of this, BuzzFeed Health reached out to two experts: Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, gastroenterologist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, and Dr. Ali Keshavarzian, director of digestive diseases at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and grantee of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). So, here's why booze can be a literal shitshow sometimes: First, let's go over how alcohol is actually processed through your digestive system. When alcohol hits the stomach, a little bit is absorbed through the stomach lining. The rest ends up sloshing around in your stomach before it goes to the small intestine. In the small intestine, alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. What's left after that is waste products and water, which moves through the large intestine (colon) until it reaches the rectum, and leaves the body...as poop. Along this magical journey, alcohol can screw with everything from your stomach enzymes to the speed of digestion, all of which can wreak havoc on your poops. Alcohol can ~speed things along~ in your intestinal tract, which is you why you might have diarrhea after drinking. The muscles of the colon contract and relax to push waste out of the body, explains Ganjhu, and alcohol can speed up those contractions. ""The increased transit time means there's less time for absorption of water in the colon, so the stools are watery and come out as diarrhea,"" says Keshavarzian. Rapid colon movements also make you feel like you need to go immediately, which explains why you sometimes need to sprint to the bar bathroom. But you're also drinking way more fluids than normal, which can loosen and liquify your stools. You consume way more liquid than normal in a night of drinking, especially if you're alternating your drinks with water — which you should. Most of the liquids end up in your bladder or they get reabsorbed in the colon, but sometimes the excess fluids end up in your stool instead, Ganjhu says. And we all know that watery, loose stool is also harder to control, so things can get a little ~explosive~. Your post-party poop problems might also be tied to certain types of alcohol or mixers. Some people have intolerances or allergies to the non-alcoholic compounds in alcohol, like the gluten from wheat in beer or the grape in wine. ""Many people have a reaction to the tanins from grape skins in red wine, which can cause nausea and diarrhea,"" says Keshavarzian. All those sugary sodas and juices mixed in cocktails can wreck your stomach, too. Drinks that are high in sugar can cause rapid gastric emptying, says Keshavarzian, where the contents of your stomach move too fast into the small intestine (cue diarrhea). And let's not rule out drunk food, either... And if you already have bowel issues or an intestinal disease like IBS, alcohol can be even worse on your gut. Doctors typically advise laying off alcohol if you have a very sensitive stomach or an intestinal disease like IBS or ulcerative colitis, says Ganjhu. Not only can alcohol worsen symptoms like diarrhea, but they can also cause additional irritation or inflammation. ""People with these diseases simply can't tolerate alcohol in the digestive tract as well as other people can,"" says Keshavarzian. On the other hand, intestinal disease could actually be the underlying problem. If you tend to have a lot of stomach or poop issues from drinking, you should visit your doctor to make sure you don't have an undiagnosed intestinal disease. But it's not just drunk poops you have to worry about. Sometimes alcohol can have the opposite effect. Alcohol can be dehydrating because it prevents your body from reabsorbing water, and at the same time you're losing more fluids through frequent urination. So if you're not drinking plenty of water with your alcohol, you can become dehydrated, which causes your poops to be harder and move slower, says Ganjhu. Translation: You're bloated and constipated. It also depends how much alcohol you drink. Interestingly enough, drinking higher amounts of alcohol doesn't always translate into more explosive diarrhea. Studies have shown that low amounts of alcohol can speed up the emptying of stomach contents into the intestines. But high amounts of alcohol can actually slow down the stomach's motility, which is more likely to cause bloating or feelings of constipation, says Ganjhu. Having food in your stomach might help reduce alcohol's effect on the intestines. Food helps to decrease the absorption of alcohol by slowing down the process of gastric emptying, says Ganjhu, when the contents of the stomach are dumped into the small intestine. That might make you feel a little bloated, but in general food will have a protective effect. Plus, you won't get hammered as fast. Drinking on an empty stomach on the other hand means more alcohol goes to the small intestine and gets absorbed into the blood so it can affect other organs like the colon, causing loose stools and diarrhea.","Alcohol can ~speed things along~ in your intestinal tract, which is you why you might have diarrhea after drinking."

2615,"A potential weapon against osteoarthritis could be right in the grocery produce aisle. Researchers from the University of East Anglia found in lab studies that sulforaphane, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, seems to be able to prevent and slow progression of joint cartilage destruction that occurs in osteoarthritis. The findings are promising, considering osteoarthritis -- which has no cure -- is the most common kind of arthritis. ""As well as treating those who already have the condition, you need to be able to tell healthy people how to protect their joints into the future. There is currently no way in to the disease pharmaceutically and you cannot give healthy people drugs unnecessarily, so this is where diet could be a safe alternative,"" study researcher Ian Clark, a professor of musculoskeletal biology at the university, said in a statement. ""Although surgery is very successful, it is not really an answer. Once you have osteoarthritis, being able to slow its progress and the progression to surgery is really important. Prevention would be preferable and changes to lifestyle, like diet, may be the only way to do that."" The study, published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism, involved applying sulforaphane to human cartilage cells, as well as cow cartilage tissue. Researchers found that the compound seemed to slow down the destruction of such cartilage. They also fed mice sulforaphane, and found that those who ate lots of the compound had less cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. Now, researchers are embarking on another study where they feed 40 osteoarthritis patients a special sulforaphane-rich ""super broccoli"" for two weeks before undergoing knee replacement surgery. Sulforaphane has shown promise in other conditions as well, particularly against cancer.

2618,"Delhi has spent over Rs 2,000 crore on Yamuna clean-up in the last 22 years. This shocking revelation came during a hearing in the Supreme Court on Monday. The reality becomes starker when you consider recent and past data that show no improvement in water quality: total coliform, or mostly human and animal excreta, continues to be in lakhs, and even crores, when the standard is a maximum of 5,000 mpn/100 ml (most probably number/100 ml). Also, dissolved oxygen (DO), a must for many forms of life in the water, continues to be negligible, which reiterates that it's a dead river. DO levels in March months of 2002 and 2006 at Nizamuddin and Palla were 0; in 2016, these were 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. Total coliform levels went up to 16 crore in June last year. No Yamuna cleaning project has managed to bring a perceptible difference to water quality. Apart from Yamuna Action Plans on which the bulk of funds were spent, the National Green Tribunal, in its 2015 judgment, had ordered augmenting the functioning of sewage-treatment plants that are running under capacity and constructing 32 smaller STPs in a decentralised manner. ""According to DJB, there are 23 STP's planned and existing as of today in Delhi....the oxidation pond at Timarpur, which was commissioned in 1947, is proposed to be closed. There is an STP at Okhla, which was commissioned in 1937, and four STP's at Kondli are lying closed due to inadequate sewerage...the entire STP infrastructure, if made fully functional, can be utilised to support and aid implementation of the project,"" NGT had said. There is no implementation of this order so far. Delhi Jal Board claims that it has the capacity to treat 604 million gallons per day of sewage, of which it is treating about 75%. Brij Gopal, former JNU professor and a member of NGT's expert panel on the Yamuna, said: ""Nothing has moved. Sewage is not even reaching the STPs. If untreated sewage is flowing down the drain, what do you expect? Plus there is no flow in the river."" Under phases I and II of the Yamuna Action Plan, launched in 1993, Rs 576.73 crore has already been spent. Under YAP-III, an additional Rs 1,600 crore has been allocated, which is yet to be used. ""Yamuna, like all of Delhi, has suffered due to multiplicity of agencies. Crores were definitely allocated but the money was used incoherently. DJB was doing something while the corporations were doing something else. We are hopeful now that the interceptor sewer system, when it is completed by next year, will finally clean the river,"" said a senior government official. Experts also say that policies to clean Yamuna have only been STP-oriented when the biggest issue is the fact that the river has no water or ecological flow. SC, in a 1998 order, had directed that 10 cumecs of water be released into the river through the year. Experts feel that 10 cumecs is inadequate, but as of now even that is not being released. Following NGT's 2015 judgment, about 10 cumecs is being released at Hatnikund, but that reduces significantly as it flows downstream. ""The only answer to this is to ensure more water is released. Sewage treatment alone cannot ensure unhindered flow"" said Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, who had moved NGT on Yamuna pollution. Meanwhile, both Centre and Delhi government have announced several cosmetic measures. For example, last year, Centre launched a trash skimmer to clean the water surface and announced a ""proper"" chhat ghat. In an effort to develop the river front, Delhi government started a Yamuna Aarti and developed a 'Nakshatra Vatika' along the river bed. Union water minister Uma Bharti had announced last year that Lakhwar Vyasi dam in Uttarakhand would release water in Yamuna during the lean season, which was contested by environmental experts because the project is unlikely to get environmental clearance.","dissolved oxygen (DO), a must for many forms of life in the water, continues to be negligible"
2619,"When girl gamers do well, men will often find ways to discredit the success. 'Gamer' via www.shutterstock.com Although women now make up almost half of all video game players, the gaming community remains, in some ways, hostile toward women. For example, the GamerGate controversy, which began in 2014 and involved a harassment campaign against prominent female gamers, journalists and designers, reflected a longstanding undercurrent of misogyny and sexism in the community. In some cases, those who challenged the sexism found themselves threatened with rape or death. There’s also the long-held stereotype that men are simply better gamers than women. Women gamers are often perceived as incompetent players who aren’t genuinely interested in the games but rather sign up to get attention. If a female gamer does play well, she’s often derided as a hacker – someone who cheats to gain an advantage – because ""there is no way a girl can be that good."" In a recent study, we set out to examine whether men really make better gamers than women and, if so, what drove the gender performance gap. Specifically, we wanted to compare how quickly men and women leveled up in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, which are online worlds where thousands of players develop characters, make friends, join groups, complete quests and slay dragons together. If men are actually better gamers than women, they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time. But if they don’t progress any faster, this finding would help refute one of the most pervasive stereotypes that continue to exist in the gaming community. Getting to the next level Our research used anonymous server data from over 10,000 men and women in two MMOs, ""EverQuest II"" in the United States and ""Chevaliers' Romance III"" in China. We knew each player’s actual gender through their account registration information. When players finish quests and kill monsters in MMOs, they earn experience points. When experience points reach a threshold, the player ascends to the next ""level,"" which unlocks new abilities, skills and access to new content. As in most video games, levels indicate a player’s progress. Naturally, players spending a lot of time in the game are likely to reach high levels. That is why the speed of leveling up, rather than the level itself, measures performance in our study. Before getting to our findings, we want to point out a couple of things we took into consideration. First, players who had reached the top level in the games were excluded in our analyses. Because top-level players couldn’t advance any further, their rate of leveling up was essentially zero. We removed these players to avoid confounding our analyses, but this also meant that we were not able to measure gender differences between the most advanced players. Second, our analysis recognized that the rate of leveling up slows down as players progress. For example, it would take a lot more time and effort for a level 60 player to level up than a level 30 player. Therefore, our analysis compared apples to apples by evaluating players' performance only against others who were at the same level. Contrary to the stereotype, we found that player gender itself does not cause performance differences. Instead, the perception of women as poor gamers is fueled by other factors. For example, we found that women spent less time playing overall than men and chose more assistive character classes, such as Priests, who fare better healing group members than fighting on their own. When we took such factors into account by statistically controlling them in the analyses, the gender performance gap disappeared; women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games. We also realized that different players are interested in different aspects of MMOs, and a few of those differences may correlate with gender. There’s some empirical evidence that men tend to focus more on achievement in video games – leveling up rapidly, gaining in-game status and competing against others – while women are drawn to social interactions, whether it’s helping other players or forming long-term relationships. This suggests that men should advance faster than women. However, we found the opposite: Women advanced at least as fast as men did. So taking into account different play motivations (which we were unable to do in this study’s analysis) likely only strengthens our conclusions. Beyond video games The stereotype that women are inferior gamers is not only false, but could also make women more easily discouraged and less likely to play in the first place. Of course, this gender performance stereotype exists in a number of other contexts. In the software development community GitHub, for example, women are perceived as worse coders than men. Our research has notable implications for this important social issue. Studies have shown that video games can be an important gateway to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. If stereotypes about girls and women are preventing them from playing, then it could potentially contribute to preexisting gender inequality and stereotyping in these fields. One approach to dealing with this issue is to promote stereotype-free gaming experiences for women and girls through female-supportive gaming communities, such as the PMS Clan, one of the oldest and most renowned female-oriented gaming communities in the world. Scholars such as Gabriela Richard at Pennsylvania State University have found that members of these communities are more confident and perceive themselves as better gamers. Game designers can also help. They have the ability to construct the games to make them less hostile and more welcoming to female players. For example, Riot Games established the Tribunal, a system that allows the player community to review reported bad behaviors from fellow players, and then vote on whether to punish the offender. Banned players also get a ""reform card"" with the details of the offense, as well as judgments from the Tribunal. So far, the Tribunal has significantly reduced online harassment. While programs like Tribunal are a starting point in the larger battle to end gender stereotypes, our findings will hopefully allow female gamers to realize that, when it comes to inherent skill, they’re on a level playing field.",women advanced at least as fast as men

2622,"Why should Apple have all the fun? On the day that iTunes Radio, the long-awaited streaming radio service from Apple, becomes available as part of iOS 7, Internet radio giant Pandora has some news of its own: The company on Wednesday released a new iPad app and gave its nearly decade-old logo a facelift. We'll start with the iPad app, which Pandora is calling ""the biggest redesign"" since it released its first app for the tablet in 2010. Many of the features that are now available on the Web version of Pandora -- like song lyrics, album information, a list of similar artists and the ability to share a song or station on Facebook and Twitter -- are coming to the iPad app. Pandora is also bringing Music Feed, its social network of sorts, to the iPad. Music Feed, which is already available on the web and iPhone, iPod and Android phone apps, allows people to create public or private profiles, share songs and stations they like, and discover the musical preferences of those they file. ""The great thing about the tablet is you have all the screen real estate to play with and, in general, a more lean-in experience,"" Tom Conrad, the CTO and executive vice president of product at Pandora, said in an interview with The Huffington Post. He added that the company wanted to create the ""read-the-liner-notes kind of experience we lost when we got to the digital world."" All of the changes, of course, aim to get people to spend more time with Pandora on their iPads, exposing them to more ads, which is how the company makes nearly 90 percent of its revenue. The benefit of having this type of information on the iPad app is that ""it prevents [listeners] from leaving Pandora and going to Wikipedia to find it,"" said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at NPD Group, a market research firm. ""You're giving them something that they really want badly, and you're keeping them at home, preventing them from wandering, which is a good thing."" The company says Pandora streamed over 1.3 billion hours of music to 72.1 million people last month. Although it doesn't release information about how much time people spend streaming Pandora on tablets, research from NPD Group says that about 11 percent of Pandora listeners use iPads. Fifty-nine percent listen to Pandora on a computer, and 55 percent listen on a smartphone. When it comes to the logo, the company is taking a page from the designs of other popular apps, like Facebook, Pinterest, The New York Times and Vine, opting for a simpler, cleaner mark. Gone is the blue outline and the word ""Pandora"" under the letter ""P."" Now, it's a simple blue ""P"" against a white backdrop. The logo changed Wednesday on the company's website and iOS devices, and it will change on Android devices later this fall. The company also refreshed the typeface it uses for the word ""Pandora,"" resulting in a more modern look. Pandora is doing its best to maintain its dominance in Internet radio as competition from Apple looms. Although Apple is arriving late to an already crowded space, Pandora has reason to be worried: Every person who downloads Apple's new mobile operating system -- or buys a new iPhone -- will have iTunes Radio. iTunes Radio is a streaming music service that, like Pandora, allows listeners to create stations based on songs, genres or artists. But unlike Pandora, it only works on Apple mobile devices, Apple TV and Macs and PCs -- there is no Android or Windows phone version. The free version has ads, but customers can listen without interruption for a $25 yearly subscription to iTunes Match, which stores all of your music, even from CDs, in Apple's cloud. Pandora, which last week named a new CEO, is also in a constant battle with artists and record labels about how much it has to pay in royalties. Nevertheless, investors don't seem worried.

2628,"That the pockmarked face of the Moon was caused by billions of years of collisions is well known, but we are only now able to understand just how big the asteroids hitting our satellite really were. Researchers Pete Schultz and David Crawford from Brown University have analyzed a famous impact crater within the Mare Imbrium (the Sea of Showers). The latest observation suggests a lower limit for the size of the bolide – a bright meteor – of 250 kilometers (155 miles) in diameter, much larger than previously thought. The size put it in the class of proto-planetary asteroids, objects large enough to be the likely precursors of planets. Its impact on the Moon has been significant, leaving a 1,250-kilometer-diameter (775 miles) crater. ""We show that Imbrium was likely formed by an absolutely enormous object, large enough to be classified as a protoplanet,"" said Pete Schultz, professor of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Brown University, in a statement. ""This is the first estimate for the Imbrium impactor’s size that is based largely on the geological features we see on the Moon."" The size of the impactor is not the only interesting find in this study, which is published this week in Nature. The researchers were also able to explain the so-called Imbrium Sculpture, a pattern of grooves that extend radially around the crater, as well as a second set of grooves extending from a region to the northwest of the crater center. ""This second set of grooves was a real mystery,"" Schultz said. ""No one was quite sure where they came from."" The scientists used virtual and physical models to work out how the second set of grooves formed. They believe chunks from the main object broke apart and hit the Moon before the main body. Some of the chunks might even have escaped our satellite’s gravity, and hit the Moon or Earth at a later time. This discovery could significantly expand our understanding of the Late Heavy Bombardment when comets and asteroid were repeatedly hitting the rocky planets of the Solar System. ""The Moon still holds clues that can affect our interpretation of the entire Solar System,"" Schultz added.

2629,"Fast-food chains have watched their sales growth drop off a cliff Executives advance plenty of reasons for the slowdown — or, in the case of some brands, the outright decline in sales. Some blame politics , others blame the oil crash , and so on. The real reason may be a bit simpler: It's getting cheaper for Americans to eat at home. The price of food at grocery stores has actually been on the decline since the end of 2015, based on the Consumer Price Index for food at home. In fact, in July (the most recent data available), the cost of food at home declined 1.55% from the same month a year ago. On the other hand, the cost of food away from home — what you pay at restaurants — is still on the rise. In July, prices for food away from home rose 2.79% from same month last year. According to David Palmer at RBC Capital Markets, this is also a good thing for fast-food restaurants , as ingredient prices have fallen for them, lowering costs and boosting profit margins. But the drop in food prices is also hurting sales. ""Food cost relief has been a boon to restaurant-level margins in 2016, with many fast food operators generating their best gross margins since 2012,"" Palmer wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. ""That said, lower food costs have historically been a constraint to industry sales and food deflation should last through at least 2Q17.""

2632,"Ku Klux Klan members who were to be the subjects of a reality television series about their lives have alleged that producers of the show paid them to fake scenes, recite specific dialogue and even paid for materials for cross burnings. A&E canceled its series Escaping the KKK: A Documentary Exposing Hate in America last week after the network announced it had discovered that cash payments were made to some of the subjects of the series ""in order to facilitate access."" The highly controversial documentary was to explore the relationships of Klan members and their families, including those trying to leave the white supremacist group, and was advertised to viewers as a no-holds-barred account of life inside the organization. But according to an investigation by Variety, some KKK members featured in the documentary allege they were instructed by producers to do and say certain things, including using the racial slur ""n*gger"" in interviews and to re-shoot certain scenes until the production was satisfied. ""We were betrayed by the producers and A&E,"" one of the series’ subjects, KKK Grand Dragon Richard Nichols, told Variety. ""It was all made up — pretty much everything we said and did was fake and because that is what the film people told us to do and say."" Nichols told the outlet he was approached to appear in the series by producers who said they wanted to show what life was really like in the Klan. But Nichols claims he was paid $600 per day to participate in the series and that scenes involving himself and a young man he attempted to ""recruit"" into the KKK were all made up, as were scenes involving a cross burning in his hometown of Pulaski, Tennessee. ""It was the producers who told me they wanted a cross-lighting,"" he told Variety. ""In fact they made two cross-lightings cause they wanted to reshoot some scenes. They bought everything—the wood, the burlap to wrap around the wood, the diesel and kerosene for my cross lighting. They even brought all the food for everyone."" Two leaders of other KKK groups featured in the series claim they were paid $500 per day to participate and said they had played along with pre-planned storylines at the request of producers. A spokesperson for A&E said the network planned to conduct a ""full independent investigation"" into the production, while production company This Is Just A Test offered its own statement. ""We take these allegations very seriously and in partnership with A&E we will be looking into them fully,"" the statement said. ""We have been told that participants in the series have received threats and coerced into speaking out against the authenticity of the show."" Escaping the KKK was scheduled to premiere on A&E on January 10. A rep for the network did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Ku Klux Klan members who were to be the subjects of a reality television series about their lives have alleged that producers of the show paid them to fake scenes, recite specific dialogue and even paid for materials for cross burnings"
2633,"If you struggle to wake up in the morning and require a double espresso to feel human, a simple energy-boosting trick you can do during your morning shower could work wonders. According to the experts at Career Girl Daily, despite showering every morning, most of us are doing it wrong. They share a 90-second hack you can do whilst washing yourself in the morning to boost your energy and keep you awake all day. And Victoria Beckham swears by it.  If you think that taking a hot shower in the morning sets you up for the day ahead, think again. Indeed, according to the experts, dousing your body in warm water is actually sending you back to sleep. They found that when we feel colder air on our skin after getting out of the shower, the drastic temperate drop causes a tranquil state of mind.  You should, in fact, blast yourself with cold water for 30 seconds, followed by hot water for 30 seconds and freezing water again for 30 seconds. It might be unpleasant but it opens capillaries and boosts circulation so stimulates your body and mind. It also apparently reduces stress because it builds up your 'tolerance levels', boosts your immune system by creating more white blood cells and helps you burn fat more effectively. If that wasn't enough, the trick, which Victoria Beckham swears by, has an anti-depressive effect by sending high levels of electric impulses to the brain.

2636,"If you're looking for tips on how to improve your relationship, you might turn to a couples therapist, or a self-help book, or a particularly sage friend — but probably not to research in consumer psychology. And yet. On an episode of The James Altucher podcast, behavioral economist and Duke University professor Dan Ariely drew on such research to generate an easy solution to a common source of marital discord. To make your partner appreciate you more, occasionally remind them of all the ways you're contributing to the family. Let's back up to explain why this solution works. In one oft-cited study, psychologists asked members of couples individually how much they contributed to the housework. The total generally added up to more than 100%. In other words, both partners think they do more than they really do — and underestimate how much their partner does. (Interestingly, each person also tended to overestimate how much they contributed to conflicts in the relationship, suggesting that it's more about egocentrism than self-aggrandizement.) You can see how this might pose a problem, at least in the chores department. Your partner thinks she takes out the trash 70% of the time and you think you take out the trash 70% of the time, so you each end up thinking the other is lazy. Enter ""operational transparency."" In a clever 2007 study, researchers found that people shopping for hypothetical flights were equally pleased with the service they received when it was instantaneous and when it took longer but they knew why it was taking so long. (Hipmunk shows you which airlines it's currently searching, so you can see what's taking so long.Hipmunk) The researchers highlight certain travel sites as an example of real-life businesses that harness the power of operational transparency. For example, while you're waiting for the available flights to appear on the screen, Hipmunk tells you exactly which airline databases it's searching. So you can see the amount of effort they're putting in. Ariely argued that you can apply these findings to the science of relationships. Your relationship might be stronger if once in a while, you remind your partner that you've been doing the dishes or shopping for toiletries. Here's what Ariely told Altucher: ""When you come home, just share. Just tell people what you're doing for them, because otherwise people don't know. It's very easy to take people for granted."" It shouldn't be obnoxious, and you shouldn't do it all the time. But once in a while, you can tell your partner about the details of your day. Simply describe the errands you ran — first to the bank, then to the drugstore, then to the supermarket, and then to pick up the kids from school (or whatever it is that you did). ""It's more like sharing than bragging,"" Ariely said. ""Here's the complexity, and here's how my day looks like, and so on. I also don't think you should do it every day necessarily, but from time to time it's very useful to give people a sense of what it is that you're contributing to the family.""","To make your partner appreciate you more, occasionally remind them of all the ways you're contributing to the family"
2637,"In April a BMW racing through a fruit market in Foshan in China’s Guangdong province knocked down a 2-year-old girl and rolled over her head. As the girl’s grandmother shouted, ""Stop! You’ve hit a child!"" the BMW’s driver paused, then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl. The woman at the wheel drove forward once more, crushing the girl for a third time. When she finally got out from the BMW, the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal: ""Don’t say that I was driving the car,"" she said. ""Say it was my husband. We can give you money."" It seems like a crazy urban legend: In China, drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them. And yet not only is it true, it’s fairly common; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. The Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon: ""It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure."" This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother. The Passat’s back wheels bounce up over her head and body. The driver, Zhao Xiao Cheng, stops the car for a moment then hits the gas, causing his front wheels to roll over the woman. Then Zhao shifts into drive, wheels grinding the woman into the pavement. Zhao is not done. Twice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse, each time thudding over the grandmother’s body. He then speeds away from her corpse. Incredibly, Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide. Accepting Zhao’s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag, the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for ""negligence."" Zhao’s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video. As the television anchor noted, ""You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one."" ""Double-hit cases"" have been around for decades. I first heard of the ""hit-to-kill"" phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher. A fellow teacher would drive us to classes. After one near-miss of a motorcyclist, he said, ""If I hit someone, I’ll hit him again and make sure he’s dead."" Enjoying my shock, he explained that in Taiwan, if you cripple a man, you pay for the injured person’s care for a lifetime. But if you kill the person, you ""only have to pay once, like a burial fee."" He insisted he was serious—and that this was common. A Slate Plus Special Feature: How Can This Possibly Happen? Geoffrey Sant wrote about drivers in China who intentionally kill pedestrians. Ask him anything. Most people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation. In China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small—amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000—and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions. The Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $400,000 for the first 23 years of his care. Drivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical. Indeed, Zhao Xiao Cheng—the man caught on a security camera video driving over a grandmother five times—ended up paying only about $70,000 in compensation. Security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead. In 2010 in Xinyi, video captured a wealthy young man reversing his BMW X6 out of a parking spot. He hits a 3-year-old boy, knocking the child to the ground and rolling over his skull. The driver then shifts his BMW into drive and crushes the child again. Remarkably, the driver then gets out of the BMW, puts the vehicle in reverse, and guides it with his hand as he walks the vehicle backward over the boy’s crumpled body. The man’s foot is so close to the toddler’s head that, if alive, the boy could have reached out and touched him. The driver then puts the BMW in drive again, running over the boy one last time as he drives away. Here too, the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person’s death. (He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag.) Police rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime, ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy’s head as he sped away. These drivers are willing to kill not only because it is cheaper, but also because they expect to escape murder charges. In the days before video cameras became widespread, it was rare to have evidence that a driver hit the victim twice. Even in today’s age of cellphone cameras, drivers seem confident that they can either bribe local officials or hire a lawyer to evade murder charges. Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn’t injure the victim seriously, and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway. In Sichuan province, an enormous, dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy. The toddler was only dazed by the initial blow, and immediately climbed to his feet. Eyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella, which had been thrown across the street by the impact, when the truck reversed and crushed him, this time killing him. Despite the eyewitness testimony, the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed, never hit the boy a second time, and that the wheels never rolled over the child. Meanwhile, one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child’s body under the truck’s front wheel. In each of these cases, despite video and photographs showing that the driver hit the victim a second, and often even a third, fourth, and fifth time, the drivers ended up paying the same or less in compensation and jail time than they would have if they had merely injured the victim. With so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment, the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands. In 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice. (A television report claims the crowd had acted on ""false rumors."" However, at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time.) Of course, not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment. A man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead—even stabbing the injured woman with a knife—was convicted and executed. In 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases. Taiwan’s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code, which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others (such as a person killed in a traffic accident). Meanwhile, China’s legislature has emphasized that multiple-hit cases should be treated as murders. Yet even when a driver hits a victim multiple times, it can be hard to prove intent and causation—at least to the satisfaction of China’s courts. Judges, police, and media often seem to accept rather unbelievable claims that the drivers hit the victims multiple times accidentally, or that the drivers confused the victims with inanimate objects. Hit-to-kill cases continue, and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment. In January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow. In April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child. And last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW—and then offered to bribe the family—was brought to court. She claimed the killing was an accident. Prosecutors accepted her assertion, and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison.","""It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure."""
2638,"The first Chinese citizen to deliver a graduation speech at Harvard University wants to know why his mother only knew to light his hand on fire when a poisonous spider bit him. Why wasn't she able to use ""less painful, and less risky treatments"" that already existed? Jiang He, who grew up in a rural village in southern China’s Hunan Province, just received his Ph.D in molecular and cellular biology from Harvard. He explained in his Harvard commencement speech this week that his mom put a chopstick in his mouth, wrapped his hand in wine-soaked cotton, and set it on fire after the spider bit him 15 years ago. It was painful, but the flame actually deactivated proteins in the venom, Jiang said. ""I'm happy to report that my hand is fine,"" he said in his speech Wednesday, but he added, ""I'll continue to be troubled by the unequal distribution of scientific knowledge throughout the world."" Society has unlocked the human genome, but ""we haven't been so successful in deploying [knowledge] to where it is needed most."" Jiang appreciated the value of innovation, but he believes there should be more emphasis on distributing the knowledge to those who need it. ""Changing the world doesn't mean everyone has to find the next big thing -- it can be as simple as becoming better communicators and fighting more creative ways to pass on the knowledge,"" he said. Quartz noted that China’s state media outlets have bragged that Jiang was ""making history"" by delivering his speech. The graduate told SixthTone.com that people in his native village were spreading news of his speech on WeChat ahead of the commencement, which shows how technology can help improve the lives of people in rural, remote areas. Society must recognize that the equal distribution of knowledge is a pivotal step of human development and we should work to bring this into reality, Jiang said. ""And if we do that,"" he said, ""then perhaps a teenager in rural China who is bitten by a poisonous spider will no longer have to burn his hand, but will know to seek a doctor instead.""","after the spider bit him 15 years ago.

2642,"EA Finally Reveals Why Star Wars: Battlefront Didn’t Have A Single Player Campaign Image: starwars.ea.com Executive Vice President of EA Studios, Patrick Soderlund discussed why Star Wars Battlefront didn’t have single player campaign while speaking during EA’s Investor Day event. Soderlund also hinted that the single player campaign might be introduced in the sequel of the game. The EA Studios boss mentioned that the decision to leave out the campaign mode from Star Wars Battlefront was purposeful. He said that the decision had to be made in order to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is notable that Battlefront had content from Jakku which was also relevant in The Force Awakens. The game, however was based on the original Star Wars Trilogy. Although the game was a commercial success, Soderlund said that he wasn’t happy with the average review score of the game. The game scores 72 in the PC and PlayStation 4 versions and 75 on Xbox One version on Metacritic. He said, ""The one thing that we got criticized for was the lack of a single-player campaign. It was conscious decision we made due to time and being able to launch the game side-by-side with the movie that came out to get the strongest possible impact."" ""I think the team created a really good game based on the premise that we had. I would say the game has done very well for us and reached a very different demographic than a traditional EA game. So from that perspective, it’s a success. Are we happy with the 75 rating? No. Is that something we’re going to cure going forward? Absolutely,"" he added. Despite not having a single-player campaign mode, Battlefront does have solo and offline ‘Missions’. He also detailed how EA is looking into the ‘depth and breadth’ before starting a new project. ""The depth and breadth is something that’s proving to be more and more important,"" he said. ""In a world where we want $60 up front and we expect people to stay with us over the course of a long time, the depth of what we offer is important."" Soderlund added, ""We have to go back and course correct that for another version if we were ever to build one."" On the other hand, EA CFO Blake Jorgenssen said last week that they were working on a sequel to Battlefront which will include content from the recent movies and have better and bigger worlds. Keeping in mind, Soderlund’s comments, it is safe to assume that the sequel will also feature a single-player campaign, which is bound to strike the right chords with fans.",to release the game early to meet the Star Wars: The Force Awakens
2645,"Many of you will have seen a series of uplifting pictures of an orangutan, published in the Mail. Showing the animal’s reaction to a simple sleight-of-hand conjuring trick, the images took the animal from puzzlement through understanding to what seemed a glorious fit of joyous laughter. If you thought only humans could see a joke, it was time for an immediate re-think. The orangutan had been shown a ‘now you see it now you don’t’ trick by a handler, who first showed the animal a chestnut in a cup and then secretly removed the nut before showing the cup again. When the orangutan cottoned on that he’d been ‘had’, he responded with what we humans can’t help but understand as hilarity, rolling on the floor in apparent mirth. The orangutan was laughing at the wacky incongruity of seeing a chestnut in a cup and then finding it gone. Just like that! As Tommy Cooper would have said. It all begs the question: do animals really have a sense of humour? Or rather — because humans are animals — do non-human animals have a sense of humour? Or is humour actually a barrier that divides us from our closest animal relatives and from every other species? This sounds like the cue for a million stories about how your dog enjoys a laugh — almost every owner has his or her own anecdotes of canine pranks that suggest a real (if primitive) sense of humour. Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian zoologist who won the Nobel Prize in 1973, believed dogs laughed when they played.  ‘The slightly opened jaws which reveal the tongue, and the tilted angle of the mouth which stretches almost from ear to ear, give an impression of laughing,’ he said. ‘This ""laughing"" is most often seen in dogs playing with an adored master and which become so excited they soon start panting.’ But is the panting ‘laughter’ Konrad witnessed simply a factor of canine physiology? Dogs may look as if they’re laughing when they’re doing nothing of the sort. So what about other species? There is a YouTube video of a dolphin in a glass tank, looking out as a lithe girl performs graceful acrobatics for his benefit. The dolphin stops and is clearly delighted: humans walk on their feet, they don’t usually spring head over heels. It certainly looks as if the dolphin is laughing. Part of this is because the dolphin’s face looks uncannily like a laughing human. One of the reasons we love dolphins is because they seem to have a permanent smile: but that’s just anatomy. Even though it’s clear the dolphin finds this acrobat’s behaviour fascinating, this isn’t enough to prove scientifically that animals can laugh. Even my two favourite stories about non-human humour aren’t proof because they, too, are anecdotes, not scientific evidence gleaned from repeated experiments.  Both concern a gorilla called Koko, who lives in California and, it is claimed, can respond to 2,000 spoken words in English, and understand and communicate using 1,000 words in a modified version of American Sign Language. Koko was asked: ‘What is hard?’ In response, she made a joke — to be more accurate, she made a pun: making the signals for ‘rock’ and ‘work’. She appeared to understand an incongruous connection — both rocks and work being hard — that comes about through language. Another time Koko was working (hard, no doubt) with her trainer Francine Patterson. She tied Patterson’s shoelaces together — and then signed ‘chase’. Anyone who has played with a four-year-old child can understand the hilarity and daring of this comic effort. The trouble is that such things can’t really be put to rigid experimental testing, not least because scientific procedure is essentially humourless.  There is, after all, a difference between watching The Morecambe And Wise Christmas Special in laboratory conditions and doing so on your sofa after Christmas dinner with your dear ones and a glass of single malt. But there are scientific experiments that suggest some animals can and do laugh. Dr Marina Davila-Ross of the Department of Psychology at Portsmouth University spent years analysing the sounds apes made when they were tickled, and comparing them with human laughter. Our nearest animal relatives, the chimps and bonobos — who share more than 98 per cent of their DNA with humans — made the noises that were most like human laughter. Dr Davila-Ross also studied the noises chimps and bonobos made when mucking about with each other — or ‘play-fighting’. Human children laugh when they indulge in play-fighting. It’s much the same in the archetypal situation of wrestling with or being tickled by your dad. Play-fighting is, for some reason, hilarious. When chimpanzees play-fight, they pant. They don’t pant in the same way as they do in other contexts, such as when they are exhausted or being bullied — a bullied chimp makes noises that express fear, not fun. The play-fight panting sounds quite a lot like laughter and what’s more, there is an evolutionary reason for it.  While the young animals are getting lessons in fighting, their laughter makes clear they are not being hurt in the rough-and-tumble. It’s fighting that’s fun and affectionate. Gorillas and orangutans pant in the same way and science has now shown that all the great apes seem to have something that can be called laughter.  ‘The play-fighting serves a very social function,’ says Peter McGraw, a psychologist at the University of Colorado.  ‘Some is bonding and some is learning to fight. But what you always see is that the animal being attacked is the one making these vocalisations, which we interpret as laughter. ‘I believe that through evolution, laughter developed as a way of showing that something which would otherwise be wrong is OK.’ And that, surely, shows the link between animal laughter and our own. In humans, laughter has evolved from its play-fighting origins into an essential social tool to express a vast gamut of feelings. But it’s still used to make sense and fun of the incongruous — to show ‘something which would otherwise be wrong is OK’. Dolphins play-fight, too, and when they do so they make a brief series of sonar pulses followed by a whistle. The sound is never made during serious aggressive encounters. The sound is telling the opponent this is just larking about. Play-fighting in humans often involves tickling and tickling involves giggling. This led to a series of experiments at Bowling Green University in Ohio, where they observed that rats make ultra-sonic chirps of pleasure when play-fighting and playing chase. They then found rats make the same sounds when being tickled. ‘I don’t necessarily call it laughter,’ said researcher Jeffrey Burgdorf. ‘I call it a signal of positive intent.’ A shared response to pleasurable incongruity, friendship and fun doesn’t seem to be restricted to the human species. Charles Darwin argued that there was ‘no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness and misery’. Put a big stress on the word ‘fundamental’ and you grasp his point. Whenever you look for a cast-iron certain way of separating humans from all other forms of animals, you find instead a grey area, a no man’s land in which the differences seem muddied and uncertain. Many animals use complex forms of communication that can be called language. Many solve difficult problems. Some make and use tools. Grief has often been observed. Elephants have been seen burying their dead, vampire bats engage in altruism, humpback whales have culture, bowerbirds create visual art, nightingales compose and perform music. Whenever you look at the difference between humans and animals you only find differences of degree. Humans have a sense of humour and we can, if we look with the right eyes, find its origin in species other than our own. Even in our dogs.","Whenever you look at the difference between humans and animals you only find differences of degree.

And Help From The Community They also have the support of their entire community to help them in the exciting time. Some friends of the family have set up a GoFundMe account to aid the family with basic supplies and things they need in the beginning.

They also have a Facebook page to showcase their journey in raising the quads. In the beginning, the couple was excited for one baby, but they ended up getting four times the amount of excitement. Bethani and Tim’s story is nothing less than incredible. In the beginning, they were just a couple in love excited to start a family. They had no idea what they were getting into and quickly went from a family of two to a family of six in a matter of months. It’s remarkable that Bethani became pregnant with the four girls naturally, and it’s even more incredible that she was able to have such a smooth and healthy pregnancy. raising four little girls at once will be challenging for the family, but having a big family full of miracles is something the couple is very excited to experience.","gave birth to natural quadruplets, but the fact that they were all identical"
2654,"The mystery of the Bermuda Triangle (also known as the Devil’s Triangle) has stumped scientists for decades. Update: The meteorologist behind these findings has issued a statement following these reports suggesting the microbursts alone probably aren't responsible for the disappearance of many ships and planes in the region. The Bermuda Triangle remains a very mysterious location and it's hard to say for sure what's caused all of these unexplained disappearances. For far too long, a myriad of ships and planes have randomly went missing whenever passing through this region. Survivors have said compasses and geolocation devices go crazy, and conspiracy theorists have blamed several things ranging from aliens to the government. But more realistically, what could really be the root cause of what’s going on in this region connected by the three points of Miami, Florida San Juan, Puerto Rico and Bermuda? Scientists think they’re made a breakthrough discovery that could lay to rest all the fairy tale rumors of the region, and the first clue they discovered was found in the clouds. Hexagonally shaped, rather than fluffy and puffy like anywhere else in the world, it has been theorized that ‘air bombs’ are being formed in the atmosphere and would be detrimental to ships and planes. These ‘air bombs,’ more prominently known to the world as microbursts, can occur in certain atmospheric conditions and can literally swat a plane out of the air and over-turn large ships with Hurricane-force wind speeds of more than 170 miles per hour. ""They are formed by what are called microbursts and they're blasts of air that come down out of the bottom of a cloud and then hit the ocean and then create waves that can sometimes be massive in size as they start to interact with each other,"" Meteorologist Randy Cerveny explains. ""Most of the time, clouds are random in their distribution."" In a microburst, a high-speed burst of air exits the clouds in the sky and forces its way down towards the Earth's surface or in this case, the Atlantic Ocean. These incredible forces of nature have been responsible for the loss of more than 1,000 lives in the past 100 years, and at least four planes and 20 ships are said to go missing on an annual basis. This is for sure an interesting theory that makes a lot of sense. Microbursts aren’t technically very common occurrences, but the Bermuda Triangle seems to be a hotspot for this kind of activity. Scientists aren’t really sure why. For what it’s worth, the Bermuda Triangle is just one of the ten Vile Vortices around the world. There are many more just like it, but the Bermuda Triangle is certainly the most famous one. Despite these findings, it's not a solution to the issue. The Bermuda Triangle is simply a dangerous place to sail a ship or fly a plane, and that may never change.

2657,"Benign and universally beloved as it seems, pizza is a food that’s rife with controversy. The New York/Chicago rivalry over whose pizza is ""best"" will never be resolved, and politicians have been mocked for taking fork and knife to a slice. Perhaps even more contentious than these is the question of pizza-blotting—is it a culinary crime to dab at the grease atop a pizza with a napkin? Either way, there's some good news for blotters: blotting the oil off the top of pizza does make it measurably healthier. Shockingly, federal funding for research into pizza nutrition has been limited, so there’s no strict scientific consensus on how many calories make the jump from pizza to paper towel when a slice is blotted. The closest approximation comes from the Food Network’s series Food Detectives. Host Ted Allen and a team of researchers from Popular Science came up with the figure of ""35 calories per slice on average (3.5 grams of oil)."" CNN’s Dr. Roshini Raj gives a similar appraisal: ""You are probably cutting 20 to 50 calories a piece – not a whole lot, but [...] if you have a couple of slices, it adds up."" With an average slice of cheese pizza weighing in at 272 calories, blotting off 35 calories per piece equals a 13% reduction. Nutrition-savvy readers might recognize that 35 calories also equates to 1/100th of 3,500 calories: the number doctors generally agree equals one pound of human fat. An infographic by Labdoor Magazine gets a little bit more realistic with its calculations, using a slice of Domino’s pepperoni pizza as its standard and calculating total calorie reduction over a year based on the national average for pizza consumption: 23 pounds of pizza for every American. According to those calculations, blotting off the pizza grease can soak up 6611.2 calories in a year, or nearly two pounds’ worth of fat. Of course, there are caveats to the pizza blotting strategy. Along with fatty orange oil slicks, an injudiciously applied napkin might remove a pizza’s seasonings or take a bit of cheese and sauce with it, so it’s a choice that shouldn’t be made lightly. Blot if you will, but maybe just once in a while, leave the napkin on the side and live a little.

And if you’ve paid a particularly high price for avocados lately, you’re not the only one. A significant avocado shortage drove prices upward this summer, according to The Street. This is likely due to a mixed-up Mexican harvest season that left suppliers with fewer avocados than usual. (Don’t panic just yet, though: Things should be turning around right about now.) Add it all up, and this explains why you may have paid more for your avo grilled cheese fixings this summer. Indeed, the Hass Avocado Board shows a jump in retail value from 93 cents per avocado in May to more than a dollar per avocado by mid-June, Eater points out.

2664,"If you play video games – and even if you don’t – your Facebook feed has begun to drizzle with posts about the first-person shooter Overwatch. Those drizzles are about to turn into a flood. This morning, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it will implement Facebook Live API, allowing players to log in to Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and the newest sensation Overwatch and live-stream sessions onto their timelines later this month via PC. No definite start date was announced, though. The new features will allow friends to subscribe to other player’s timelines, notifying them when a new stream has begun. Presumably, as with Facebook’s current live streaming video functionality, friends and subscribers can comment and share while tuned in to the stream. ""Blizzard games are best when played with friends, so it’s important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,"" said Blizzard executive vice president of corporate operations Gio Hunt. ""We’re working closely with Facebook on this integration for Overwatch, as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as development progresses."" This new development was almost inevitable, given the popularity of Facebook video and game streaming on platforms like Twitch. Blizzard started streaming on Facebook this year with ""Heroes of the Dorm,"" the collegiate Heroes of the Storm tournament that aired on ESPN 2 last year. At the launch of Overwatch last week, which Elon Musk is a fan for whatever that’s worth, Blizzard live-streamed the event for its 3 million fans. The unity between Facebook and Blizzard wasn’t overnight. To prep for Overwatch’s launch, Facebook and Blizzard worked on a ""comprehensive mix"" of marketing solutions using Facebook’s targeting capabilities. This helped expose Overwatch to 1.65 billion people, which explains why everyone is obsessed about it and you’re a loser if you’re not playing it.","Blizzard Entertainment announced that it will implement Facebook Live API, allowing players to log in to Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III, StarCraft II, and the newest sensation Overwatch and live-stream sessions onto their timelines later this month via PC."

2670,"Whether or not you have siblings, it's likely that at some point or another you were told to share your toys. But one mum wants to rethink that message. Alanya Kolberg posted to Facebook last week about an interaction she and her son had with other children at the park. ""As soon as we walked in the park, Carson was approached by at least 6 boys, all at once demanding that he share his transformer, Minecraft figure, and truck,"" she wrote. ""He was visibly overwhelmed and clutched them to his chest as the boys reached for them. He looked at me. 'You can tell them no, Carson,' I said. 'Just say no. You don't have to say anything else.'"" When her son told the boys that they couldn't play with his toys, they ran to Kolberg to tell her that Carson wasn't sharing. ""I said, 'He doesn't have to share with you. He said no. If he wants to share, he will,'"" she wrote. Her words earned her dirty looks from other parents, according to Kolberg, likely for going against a commonly held lesson — that kids should always be told to share their things. ""Whose manners are lacking here,"" Kolberg wondered. ""The person reluctant to give his 3 toys away to 6 strangers, or the 6 strangers demanding to be given something that doesn't belong to them, even when the owner is obviously uncomfortable?"" People seem to resonate with her message, which has more than 200,000 shares as of writing. She goes on to claim that we should be teaching children how to function like adults, who would never ask a stranger to use something that doesn't belong to them. She uses a sandwich as an example (what stranger would ask another stranger for their sandwich?) but the same could be said of technology or other objects comparable to Carson's toys. But the big question here is: should we actually be treating children like adults? Learning to share can be an important lesson for kids, who will need to grow up knowing that it's sometimes okay to lend other people their stuff or to collaborate on projects. And it's easy to see why those boys were so excited that someone brought new toys to the playground. The playground is a place where kids go to play together, even kids who don't already know each other, and someone who brings new toys offers even more exciting things to play with. But still, Kolberg's post makes an important point about allowing yourself to say ""no."" The issue here might not that Carson should never learn to share — he should and has — but that he needed to say ""no"" in the moment. Kolberg wrote in her post that she and Carson were meeting a friend and their daughter at the park that day. Carson brought his toys to share with the little girl — who we can see in the picture Kolberg attached with her post — so that they could play together. It's clear from the photo that Carson knows how to share, and is happy to, but that he simply didn't want to ruin his surprise by sharing with those boys first. He needed to say ""no"" to them so that he could play with his friend. So while Kolberg told Carson that day at the park that he doesn't have to share his things every time someone wants to share them, her post doesn't really seem to be about sharing at all. It's about learning to say ""no"" when it's important for your own well-being, which is a lesson more of us could use. ""While I do know some adults who clearly never learned how to share as children, I know far more who don't know how to say no to people, or how to set boundaries, or how to practice self-care,"" Kolberg wrote. ""Myself included.""",Alanya Kolberg posted to Facebook last week about an interaction she and her son had with other children at the park.
2672,"Recognition of the Joker’s significance stretches back to the character’s first appearance in April of 1940, when a last-minute editorial move saved the Clown Prince of Crime from a swift exit from Batman lore. Bill Finger, co-creator of the Caped Crusader himself, initially expressed a desire to kill off the villainous jokester before his ever-wise editor, Whitney Ellsworth, demanded that the character live on. And live on he has. Over the many years that have passed since that fateful overturning of Finger’s creative decision, the Joker has appeared to us in many incarnations and iterations, the most notable of them being Heath Ledger’s interpretation of the character in 2008’s The Dark Knight. Now, with the release of David Ayer’s Suicide Squad, musician-turned-actor Jared Leto attempts to fill Ledger’s impossibly big shoes by adding new fervor and new flavor to the role. However, while Leto’s tatted-up take on Batman’s greatest adversary displays a level of commitment that’s as refreshing as it is terrifying, it fails to captivate and convince. He won’t stick with viewers the way Ledger did (and does), but he will cement himself as one of the most fascinatingly miscast versions of the character to ever grace the silver screen. And even if that’s not what we wanted, it’s still worth discussing. Sadly, of all the actors who’ve taken the dive into the character’s perversion, Leto’s hollow, hateful Joker may be the weakest portrayal we’ve seen yet. It’s a steep dive, to be sure, one that requires the performer to consider the darkest corners of the human psyche and operate from that darkness with unmistakable aplomb. It’s unfortunate, then, that his performance lacks both conviction and competence, instead coming off as a desperate, desire-driven audition that casts a pall over the film’s proceedings in a big, distracting way. Somewhere amidst the clutter and the chaos, he loses the dangerous edge that makes the Joker so fun and fearsome. He loses part of what makes the Joker...the Joker. Here, he’s just a slick-haired, silver-grilled criminal with the hots for Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and a penchant for wanton destruction (which, admittedly, keeps him close to the character’s roots). That’s really all there is to him, and that’s a shame. Beneath Leto’s need to emulate Ledger lies a performance that could’ve meant something within the context of the DCEU (DC Extended Universe). With layers (and emotions) stacked sky-high, Leto’s Joker possessed potential that he squanders the second he steps onscreen, alternating between gangster and lover before reverting back to the former for the rest of the film. Why not expand on the loving, lustful side of the Joker? And why give us something we’ve seen a better version of in a better movie instead? He’s not consistent and he’s not compelling, so what exactly can he bring to a movie that so desperately needed him to show up? All he does is show off. This is the Joker we’re getting for the foreseeable future, and so far, he hasn’t delivered. His performance functions as a bad impression of Ledger, whose Tom Waits-inspired Joker introduced us to a new version of the character that, for many, became the definitive iteration. Leto won’t enjoy the cultural clout that Ledger has posthumously earned, and it’s unlikely that he will endure or endear himself as anything other than a wannabe who played to someone else’s strengths. I’m just speculating here, but the decision to make Leto a Ledger knockoff could have easily been Ayer’s, which would explain why he grows to be as derivative, dull, and flavorless as the rest of the disastrous film. The director demanded that too many liberties be taken with the Joker’s aesthetic for me to believe that anybody else could’ve been responsible. That, and the whole ""gangster Joker"" thing really only worked with Ledger behind the makeup and machinations Leto could’ve turned in an incredible performance if he and Ayer had made his portrayal a bit more inspired. Instead, the two deliver a one-dimensional thug who basks in the garish glow of the film’s headache-inducing lighting and enjoys his own mediocrity just a bit too much. He’s exactly what I’ve been secretly afraid of for months now, and not in a good way. If you look back at the actors who’ve portrayed the Joker in films and times past, you’ll see that each of them brought something unique to the role. Sure, they pulled pieces of the character from the comic book pages he calls home, but they infused their respective takes with an originality, an individuality that set them apart from every performance that came before and after theirs. Cesar Romero (who hilariously ""hid"" his prominent mustache under his Joker paint) offered up chaff and chuckles, while Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger (the two best live-action Jokers) opted for darker, more nuanced performances. Mark Hamill, the voice of the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series, brought a sort of animated menace to the character and cemented himself as one of the most competent actors to ever lend his voice to a Batman villain. Leto, on the other hand, gives us....just about nothing. To be fair, the filmmakers cut the Joker from a sizable chunk of the movie, so one could make the argument that Leto simply drew the shortest straw and didn’t get a chance to truly show off his chops. However, that still won’t convince the people (myself clearly included) who find his failings to be inherent and not earned. From the moment he dons his bling and sets about turning the city upside down in his search for Harley Quinn, it’s made clear that what he’s shooting for and how he’s shooting for it just doesn’t work. He flip-flops between cartoonish camp and uncompromising darkness, never once realizing that it’s impossible to straddle such a stark line and be taken seriously. It’s bad enough that we don’t know which Joker he is, but when he doesn’t even know, it becomes a serious problem that probably won’t be and can’t be fixed anytime soon. Writing this article instilled a sadness, a despair in me that eats away at my hopes that the DCEU will pull it together and become something as powerful and weighty as the comics upon which it’s loosely based. During filming, Suicide Squad would occasionally drop images and short clips of Leto’s Joker with the hope that we’d be hyped enough to eventually see him in action. Hell, even Leto hyped his performance, sporting a kind of twisted enthusiasm that seemed to spell good news at the time. And you know what? I was hyped for this new Joker too. I didn’t particularly love his appearance, but I was willing to let it slip past my judgements if he delivered a performance worth remembering. Sadly, his Joker barely even functions as a good background villain. He’s thrown in so that Harley Quinn can have someone to work off of, but the scenes between them don’t do their comic book relationship any justice. Sure, the ""love"" is definitely present, but it’s not convincing and it’s not interesting. Jared Leto may have dropped the ball with his underwhelming Clown Prince of Crime, but that doesn’t mean he can’t turn things around. With better direction, better writing, and a whole lot of reworking, the DCEU Joker could possibly function as a passable recurring villain for Batman and his fellow DC heroes. Granted, they’d have to work in lots of improvements for the character to redeem himself after his Suicide Squad role, but it’s not impossible. If it were up to me, I’d tell him to lose the tattoos and the bling, but they can’t do that now. Why? Because continuity. Jared Leto will return as the Joker in a future DCEU film, there’s no doubt about it. We’re just hoping his currently non-existent performance improves upon this one.","his performance lacks both conviction and competence, instead coming off as a desperate, desire-driven audition that casts a pall over the film’s proceedings in a big, distracting way."
2673,"LinkedIn is giving its users bad advice. Here's the rub: By suggesting users only connect with people they already know, LinkedIn is actually doing the opposite of what makes the platform so powerful - the depth and breadth of your connection list. Put simply, the more people you are connected to on LinkedIn, the more visibility and reach you have on the platform. Show Up and Stand Out Here's just one example: With 433 million members in 200 countries, LinkedIn has one of the planet's most powerful internal search engines. And the more people you're connected to on LinkedIn, the better chance your profile has of showing up high on searches related to the products or services you provide. (Note: If you haven't already, now would be a good time to make sure you have the key ingredients of creating a killer LinkedIn profile in place!) Think about it this way: If a Small Business Owner (let's call him ""John Doe"") hops on LinkedIn because he need to find a CPA in Chicago, John is likely to type ""CPA Chicago"" into the LinkedIn Search bar to see what results come up. If you're a CPA in Chicago, having those keywords (""CPA"" and ""Chicago"") in your LinkedIn headline, summary and profile sections tells LinkedIn's Search Engine that your profile is a relevant result for John's search. However, LinkedIn will give preference to 1st and 2nd degree connections of John Doe, because in LinkedIn's mind someone that John Doe knows (meaning a 1st or 2nd degree connection) is going to be more relevant. So LinkedIn filters John Doe's ""CPA Chicago"" search result in this order: Do any of John Doe's 1st degree connections have those keywords (""CPA"" and ""Chicago"") in their profile? Do any of John Doe's 2nd degree connections have those keywords in their profile? Do any of John Doe's 3rd degree connections and everyone else have those keywords in their profile? See how this works? The more people you're connected to (especially other Small Business Owners in Chicago), the better chance you have of showing up on the first or second page of search results that John Doe sees when looking for a CPA in Chicago. And keep in mind, this is just one example of the power of your network's depth and breadth on LinkedIn. There are many others (such as publishing content on LinkedIn or appearing in the news feed of your connections with status updates, comments, likes, shares, etc.) that I don't have time to dive into here. Who Should You Connect With on LinkedIn So unless the person inviting you to connect is an obvious spammer, you should accept his or her invite. More important, you should be proactively searching for and connecting with key prospects in your niche or industry. Long story short, the more people you are connected to on LinkedIn, the better. And, lest you fret, you can adjust your user settings to ""protect"" your connections so that nobody else can see or access them (even your 1st degree connections), along with your personal email, phone and so on. Go ahead and connect with your competitors, too - they can see everything you're doing on LinkedIn anyway. In addition, being part of a competitor's LinkedIn network means now all of his or her customers are one step closer (as 2nd level connections) to getting to know you. See how this works? With all that in mind, it's time to go ahead and ignore LinkedIn's advice, and get busy accepting all those random invites!","unless the person inviting you to connect is an obvious spammer, you should accept his or her invite"

2690,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is retreating from his earlier attempts to blame President Donald Trump for a rash of threatening phone calls and vandalism attacks aimed at Jewish centers across the nation.  ""This is not a partisan atmosphere or a partisan moment,"" de Blasio said at a Tuesday press conference on Staten Island, responding to a reporter’s question about his earlier claim that Trump is responsible for the increase of anti-Semitic crimes. ""We are all united in defense of the community,"" he added. That’s a different tone from Feb. 17 when the mayor declared on his weekly WNYC ""Ask the Mayor"" segment that Trump is responsible for the rise in threats and vandalism directed against the Jewish community across the nation.  ""The horrible, hateful rhetoric that was used in this election by candidate Trump and by a lot of his supporters directly connects to an increase since the election in anti-Semitic incidents, anti-Muslim incidents, and anti-LGBT incidents,"" de Blasio said. ""It is clear here, and it is clear around the country."" The anti-Trump claim was undermined on Friday when the FBI, in coordination with the NYPD, arrested leftist journalist Juan Thompson after several threats were made to JCC centers nationwide. Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters at the news conference that Thompson is allegedly responsible for two of eight threats, one on Jan. 28 to a Jewish museum and one on Feb. 22 to the headquarters of Anti-Defamation League. However, Boyce said he believes Thompson is not responsible for the majority of the threats. ""There’s still phone calls coming to JCCs around the country, and we’ll work with our federal partners to identify that person  – or persons,"" he said.  The Mayor is facing an election in November, and this was his first public event on Staten Island, a county which voted overwhelmingly for Trump. In January, de Blasio attended a private campaign fundraiser on the island. Staten Island Councilman Joe Borelli, who represents the area where the conference took place and is a former New York Trump campaign co-chair, was asked to comment about the Mayor’s statements linking the president to crime incidents.  ""I think the Mayor and I have different worldviews on a lot of things,"" Borelli responded. ""What it comes down to is that the Mayor is certainly not my enemy or even adversary when it comes to standing against hate here on Staten Island or citywide and especially so when it is the JCC in my community."" ""There’s a push on the left to conflate anti-Semitism with Trump, while at the same time criticizing him for having Jared Kushner, who wears his Jewishness as proudly as anyone, as his most trusted confident and in the highest echelons of the White House staff,"" Borelli told Breitbart News after the Mayor’s press conference. ""It is mind-boggling,"" he said, adding: The mayor and I have a different worldview, for sure, and I am glad to stand with him in response to hate crimes in my community, but we need to be cognizant that a lot of modern anti-Semitism stems from the actions of the UN, the EU, and the global BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] movement, which has taken hold of many on the far left. I just spent a week in Israel and met with both members of the government and the opposition and found there was a tremendous amount of support for President Trump with respect to his Israeli agenda. Since March, there has been over 120 bomb threats nationwide made against Jewish institutions, with last week alone seeing 20 threats throughout the country, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Ninety-five institutions, including a dozen Jewish day schools and multiple ADL offices in New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Florida, have been threatened.  ""These are coming in at an unprecedented rate,"" Boyce said. ""We had five this morning and we will handle each one of these investigations.""  ""New threats are coming in literally as of today, directed at other Jewish Community institutions and this is a very troubling reality,"" de Blasio added.  In New York, media reports say there has been an 113 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017, with a spike of anti-Semitic hate crimes increasing from 19 to 55 incidents over the same period last year. Over the past week, New York has seen a number of threats and swastikas tags in subways, synagogues and Jewish centers. ""Oy Vey, we are coming to spray your synagogue with pig’s blood, the goyim.

""We’ve never seen such a period of concentrated threats against the Jewish community,"" de Blasio said. ""Just the last few weeks are more troubling than anything I’ve seen in many, many years.

2691,"In our new Lorde cover story, Rolling Stone examines how pop's unlikeliest superstar climbed to the top while breaking all the rules — and making people rethink what it means to be a teen girl artist in 2014. Behind the scenes at our photo shoot, we got a chance to grill Ella Yelich-O'Connor on her literary inspirations (there are many), process for picking songs to cover (it's complicated) and advice for young folks interested in getting into the music biz (it's sharp). On five authors who inspire her: Raymond Carver is definitely one. I have this thing with, like, words being in that perfect order, and you know exactly how they're trying to make you feel. And the order of the words...just, like, slapping you in the heart: ""Oh my gosh, I totally get it."" And I am really into how words sound out loud, so I was always the kid who would, like, read the page of the book to herself in her room over and over and over. And Raymond Carver is great for that. Tobias Wolff is an author who is really good for that as well. I've only read one collection from Claire Vaye Watkins, but it's one of the best collections of short fictions I've ever read. Sylvia Plath, I would say, as well. I don't read a ton of poetry, but hers is so good that you kind of can't not, I think. And then probably number five would be Kurt Vonnegut, I reckon. He's brilliant. I guess I like writers who have the kind of humor that I have, which is a sort of cynical, sardonic... black humor. He's just the don. On the figures who've most influenced her style: I feel like I would just kind of take little pieces from someone else's style. I don't know how I ended up where I am. [Rookie editor] Tavi Gevinson, probably, because we were growing up around the same time and she was so cool. She had all this crazy thrifted stuff, and so I would thrift and try and look like her. Grace Jones was an influence, because I was like, ""These shoulders! These pants! Girls can wear pants and be awesome."" That's something I definitely embody. On how her perspective has changed, post-""Royals"": It's a really weird thing to write a song like ""Royals,"" or a record like the record I wrote, and then go through something like this, which changes your entire world and way of living and changes what you do every day. And then you find yourself writing and being in a completely new stratosphere in terms of what you're talking about and how you approach certain subjects. So it has been weird. Do I really want to write a record which is like, ""I'm in my Jacuzzi and I have so much money, and I'm sad?"" It'll be interesting to see how something like this manifests itself creatively for me. On choosing covers: I'm usually really drawn to a song, and I know it would be good to cover if it sounds like something that I could write, or I wished I could write. Sometimes a writer just sounds like they're in your head, and that is really cool for me. But I think there's no point in covering something unless you're going to do something quite different and take it out of its original context and make it mean something different, and make it apply to you. So there's lots of stuff that I really want to cover, but I know there would be no point. [Laughs] For the Replacements' ""Swingin' Party""...my producer and I were just kind of surfing Spotify one night, and he was like, ""Oh, do you know this band?"" I was listening to the lyrics, and, tonally, the lyrics are just so in line with something that I would write. The subject matter just sounded like something I would write if I was as good a writer as Paul Westerberg. On what she's learned about the record biz: I've learned how to interact with people in order to get what I want, but also...you can't just crush someone's vision, you have to make compromises. That wasn't something I was familiar with until quite recently. I was so kind of fixated on exactly what I wanted to do, but now I'm quite good at taking other peoples' opinions on board. But that being said, I've totally learned in this process that 99 percent of the time your gut is right, and you know what's right for you. I know exactly what's right for my career and for my art, and sometimes, even if the whole room is saying, ""Don't do that, don't do that,"" you know that doing that is going to be good for you, in the long run. So, yeah, I guess it's a balance between listening to what other people say and not listening. On staying grounded: Well, the way I see it is that when I meet people whose music I really inspire, and they may be a little bit famous, I still get the little, ""Holy crap! This person wants to talk to me."" And I think when you stop having that feeling, and you're like, ""Oh, of course they do,"" then maybe you're not who you were anymore. On what advice she'd give aspiring musicians: If you want your music to be heard. . . you can just put stuff on the Internet and people can love it and that's cool. I think the industry is much less scary than people think it is. You have to go into it with an idea of who you are and what you want to do, and you have to have an idea of the things that you won't do, and the things that you want to aspire to. Because if you have clear goals and absolute no's for yourself, then people can figure it out. And then you won't be left like, ""Oh, shit, why did I do that ..."" I don't know, juice commercial. [Laughs] My advice to young people wanting to make music and to be in this industry is to really spend your time making music. Make so much music you have no friends. Make music. Figure out what it is you love, and. . .because if you're making cool art, then everything else will fall into line. If it's good enough, if it's cool enough, if it has enough emotion in it, people will listen, and people will love it. And there's nothing else.","when I meet people whose music I really inspire, and they may be a little bit famous, I still get the little, ""Holy crap! This person wants to talk to me."""
2693,"At the kickoff for his postelection victory lap in Cincinnati this month, Donald J. Trump bluntly told men, ""Hate to tell you,"" but women, ""generally speaking, they’re better than you are."" As a feminist, I disagree. It does women, and society, no favors to grouse about female superiority as a way to let men off the hook. When society writes off men as irredeemable, we all lose. Some 53 percent of white women voters — although thanks to minority women, not a majority of all women — rejected Hillary Clinton’s plea to break the glass ceiling and voted for Mr. Trump instead. I’ve talked to some of these women. They don’t think much of men, either. ""Trump is a narcissist,"" a middle-aged white woman in East Stroudsburg, Pa., told me in the early evening on Election Day. ""I know,"" she added, ""because my husband is one, too."" She said she disliked both candidates, but she voted for Mr. Trump. As the country prepares to revert to white male rule, our common condition for all but eight of the last 240 years, we should think harder about why we assume so little of men, including ones we may be married to. Too many men don’t prove those expectations wrong, and are rewarded anyway with prizes like the presidency. The persistence of sexism wasn’t usually something the Trump supporters I’ve met liked to acknowledge. But last summer, a fervent Trump fan I interviewed in Eastlake, Ohio — Patti Hall, 74, a retired hairdresser who wore a pink bow in her hair — bluntly declared that men didn’t want women in charge. ""I’ll grant you that,"" she said, grinning. ""They don’t want a woman in as president!"" She laughed at my raised eyebrows. ""Now, you know that’s true!"" We both looked at the world and saw men profoundly threatened by rising female power, but to Ms. Hall, this was a fixed truth, and all women could do was roll our eyes about it. Not long after Mr. Trump was caught bragging about how fame afforded him unlimited genital grabbing opportunities, the photographer Chris Arnade recalled, a woman in his hometown, Dade City, Fla., shrugged it off: ""Oh, men, you’ve got to learn how to fight them off. They’re crazy. That’s men!’ "" So what if Mr. Trump is known to have crassly assessed women based solely on whether he, Mr. Trump, found them attractive, or that he has shamed women for breast-feeding or gaining weight? That’s men. That’s your husband, your father, your brother, your son. ""I cherish women,"" Mr. Trump has said. But this is not the same as recognizing women’s equal humanity. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg, quoting a California judicial opinion, told the Supreme Court in 1971, ""the pedestal upon which women have been placed has all too often, upon closer inspection, been revealed as a cage."" When we declare that men will always be brutes and women can only shrug from on high, we engage in what President George W. Bush once called the soft bigotry of low expectations. Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. Feminists’ critique of male power has long been caricatured as hatred of men. But it is feminists whose fight is motivated by the belief that men can be better, if we can make clear that they, too, benefit from a safer, more equal and more just world. We have little choice but to try — men still control so much, and besides, many of us love them. Our intimate lives, where we are the most vulnerable and the least rational, are the hardest to reconcile with politics. And the very idea that men and women can and should be equal partners is only a generation or two old. Most of us, even now, are just making it up as we go along. In 1996, Gloria Steinem offered a theory about why so many people hated Hillary Clinton: ""She and the president are presenting, at a very high, visible level, a new paradigm of a male-female relationship. And that is very much resented."" Mrs. Clinton was pilloried for her ostensibly traditional choice to stay with her unfaithful husband. It would come back to haunt her. This year, renewed attention to accusations against Bill Clinton did nothing to dispel the notion that all men are pigs, effectively defusing the many accusations against Mr. Trump. They’re crazy. That’s men. Or as Melania Trump put it in an interview after the ""Access Hollywood"" video surfaced: ""Sometimes I say I have two boys at home — I have my young son and I have my husband. But I know how some men talk, and that’s how I saw it."" The Trump marriage offers some pretty basic math on what women can expect from men. In 2005, months into his third marriage, Mr. Trump acknowledged that in some quarters, marriage had changed. ""There’s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife, and you know, there’s a lot of husbands that listen to that,"" he said in a radio interview. Mr. Trump, he made clear, was not one of those husbands. ""I mean, I won’t do anything to take care of them,"" he said of his future offspring. ""I’ll supply funds and she’ll take care of the kids. It’s not like I’m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park."" The Trumps’ arrangement has the benefit of bald simplicity, and Mr. Trump is not alone in extolling it. People without a college degree, from whom the president-elect saw strong support, were in a 2013 Pew survey nearly twice as likely as the college-educated to say it was better for a marriage if a husband made more money than the wife. Unfortunately for those ideals, this is the demographic for whom the gender pay gap has narrowed most. If white women of all education levels were more susceptible to Mr. Trump’s nostalgic, macho transactionalism, perhaps it was because they are adjacent to the men who have traditionally enjoyed the most resources and power in society, and who either believe they have lost it or fear losing it. By contrast, black women, who overwhelmingly voted for Mrs. Clinton, were 14 percentage points more likely than white women to see themselves as leaders — and 23 points more likely to be the primary wage earners at home, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll in September. These women’s lives, whether by necessity or choice, already belie the fiction that a man’s job is to provide and not much else. Mr. Trump also won married women, for whom it may cost more to challenge the men in their lives. I spoke to a 50-year-old newspaper carrier in Texas, a Clinton voter, who explained to me why she believed her mother and other white women went for Mr. Trump. ""Here comes Hillary, and she’s a strong woman and it makes a lot of men mad, and it makes a lot of women uncomfortable, and they want to keep peace in their homes."" But the highest-placed public testament to the notion that even powerful men are capable of seeing women as partners and taking joy in parenting — not to mention getting this far without being accused of groping a woman, or several, against her will — is still in the White House. Barack Obama, who identifies as a feminist, even recently reflected on his own shortcomings as a husband at home: ""I can look back now and see that, while I helped out, it was usually on my schedule and on my terms. The burden disproportionately and unfairly fell on Michelle."" Men taking responsibility, even retrospectively, is what it’s going to take for us to believe another world is possible, one in which we don’t romanticize female superiority to let men off the hook. As a woman marrying a man next year, I have to believe that such a world could exist. I don’t think either of us is better or worse than the other because of our genders; we’re just two people who hope we can be better, together. I know I’m lucky. If I thought all men were like Mr. Trump, or would be if they had the chance, who knows what I would do.",They don’t think much of men
2696,"< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 5 NEXT SLIDE > © Provided by Mirror The idea that families come in all shapes and sizes has never been more true with adoption, same-sex relationships and the introduction of new ways to conceive. Writer Samuel Leighton-Dore, 25, spoke to Mirror Online about his decision for his sister to have his child - and has opened up about the negative response it has received. Samuel, from Sydney, is in a relationship with photographer and designer Bradley Tennant but doesn't want to miss out on their baby having both of their family's genes. As a compromise, his sister Bronte has agreed to donate her eggs so that the couple can have the family they've always wanted. Samuel told Mirror Online: ""It's not too strange when you break it down. We'll be using IVF. It'll be my sister's egg and my partner's sperm with a third-party surrogate, preferably someone who already has a family of their own. ""It's the only way my partner and I can both have a biological connection to our future children. ""It might sound vain to some people, but I think the desire to have a child with the person you love is pretty intrinsic and natural."" The couple aren't entering into the decision lightly. Samuel says a baby is still ""a few years away"" as the process is all very expensive, but he stresses that ""it's definitely something you have to think about and plan ahead of time."" Samuel has been floating the idea with Bronte on and off for a while, but says they started speaking more seriously about it as they got older. He said: ""I think she's excited about it. We've always been close so I think it means a lot to her that she's in a position to help Brad and I start a family one day."" Bronte won't be known as the child's mother but Sam thinks he and Bradley will call her a 'special auntie' or 'fairy godmother'. ""It's always important for a child to have a strong female presence in their life, so I'm sure she can be that person in a way that doesn't cross the line into parenting."" The couple have a great support system behind them and have had a wonderfully positive response from their immediate family. ""My parents are both pretty open-minded, so the discussion hasn't been as complicated as some might expect. We're lucky. I'm not sure what my extended family will think, but I'm sure they'll understand the science, logic and love behind the process."" Unfortunately, narrow-minded social media users haven't been so understanding - but Samuel takes these with a pinch of salt. ""There's always going to be a knee-jerk reaction from those who read headlines but not the full story. I've received a few nasty messages and copped some hate on Instagram, but most of the responses have been really lovely and positive."" And for all those couples who might consider going down a similar route but are worried about reaction? Samuel has some lovely advice for you. ""I'd say that we're all so incredibly lucky to be living in a time that facilitates so many different ways to make a loving family. If all parties involved are committed and happy, then go for it.""","As a compromise, his sister Bronte has agreed to donate her eggs so that the couple can have the family they've always wanted."
2700,"Ferrari’s current hypercar offering, the LaFerrari, is about as awesome as a car can get. The car is powered by a V12 engine and electric motors which together produce 950 bhp. And it’s as exclusive as cars come – only 500 coupe models were ever made and 209 convertibles will be made. Each example costs an eye-watering $1 million or about Rs 6.5 crore. Owners probably think themselves lucky to even own one. Except for this one gentleman from South Africa. His LaFerrari is destined to be turned into scrap metal by a car crusher. Here’s why. According to Fin24, about three years ago, he tried to bring the car to his home country, but couldn’t muster the taxes and duties the govt. imposes. The car was therefore left to languish in a warehouse. Then in February this year, the owner submitted an export declaration to take the car to Congo. But a day after leaving South Africa, the car was allegedly smuggled back into the country from the same border post. As luck would have it, they were caught. Now, the car has been impounded again and if the owner is not able to justify the car’s import back into the country, the car will be crushed into a cube.","the car has been impounded again and if the owner is not able to justify the car’s import back into the country, the car will be crushed into a cube"
2702,"Here's some not-so-great news, considering many of us will be moving into chillier weather in the upcoming months: New research shows that cold weather might not be good for our hearts. Two new studies, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2013, show that cold weather not only seems to be linked with heart risk factors, but it also seems to be associated with more heart attacks. The first study, conducted by Dr. Pedro Marques-Vidal of Switzerland, shows that heart risk factors, including high blood pressure, cholesterol and waist circumference, seemed to be higher than average in the winter months -- particularly January and February -- and lower than average in the summer months -- particularly June, July and August. The findings are based on data from 10 studies from seven European countries, which included a total of 107,090 people between the ages of 35 and 80. For example, systolic blood pressure levels (the top number on a blood pressure reading) were 3.5 millimeters of mercury lower, on average, during the summer than the winter. Meanwhile, waist circumference was 1 centimeter, on average, smaller during the summer than the winter. Total cholesterol was 0.24 millimoles per liter lower, on average, during the summer than the winter. ""We observed a seasonal variation in waist circumference but BMI did not change throughout the year,"" Marques-Vidal said in a statement. ""We have no clear explanation for this finding. Total cholesterol may increase during the winter because of changes in eating habits. There was no seasonal variation in glucose, probably because several cohorts did not collect blood samples in the fasting state. We have begun a study on seasonality of food intake which may help explain these findings."" In the second study, conducted by Belgian researcher Marc Claeys, an association was found between lower temperatures and increased heart attack risk. Specifically, heart attack risk went up by 7 percent for every 10 degree Celsius drop in temperature. However, researchers were unable to find any link between heart attack risk and air pollution, contrary to other research. The study is based on data from 15,964 people who had experienced heart attack, with an average age of 63. ""A potential mechanism to explain the increased risk of coronary events associated with decreasing temperature is the stimulation of cold receptors in the skin and therefore the sympathetic nervous system, leading to a rise in catecholamine levels,"" Claeys explained in a statement. ""Moreover, increased platelet aggregation and blood viscosity during cold exposure promotes thrombosis and clot formation.""","linked with heart risk factors, but it also seems to be associated with more heart attacks"
2703,"In 2011, relationship expert Tracy McMillan made waves when The Huffington Post published her polarizing blog titled ""Why You're Not Married."" In it, she wrote candidly about the self-destructive behaviors that can hold people back from finding meaningful, authentic love. It's been three years since McMillan's blog went viral, and now she's back to sit down with Oprah for another brutally honest conversation about the spiritual path of relationships, love and, of course, sex. In her upcoming interview on ""Super Soul Sunday,"" McMillan addresses the issue of casual sex, which she writes about in her book, Why You're Not Married... Yet. ""You say, 'Past a certain age, casual sex is like recreational heroin. It doesn't stay recreational for long,'"" Oprah reads from McMillan's book. ""What a powerful, savvy line."" McMillan acknowledges that casual sex may work for some people, but strongly advises taking a close look at yourself to determine whether you're one of them. ""You can't take your three girlfriends who are successful having casual sex and be one of them if that's not you,"" she says. ""You just need to figure out who you are."" On a personal level, McMillan says she knows that she is not one of those women. ""I cannot have casual sex and keep it casual. Doesn't work for me,"" she shares. ""People just have to ask themselves, can you do it? If you can't, then you need to stop having the casual sex."" To illustrate her point, McMillan equates having casual sex to taking a temp job. ""You can't take a temp job hoping that if you're so great, you really 'wow' on the temp job, you can work it into full time,"" McMillan says. ""That is not how relationships work, where you're going to start with the casual sex, which is the temp job, and work it into the full time, which is the committed relationship."" ""Yeah,"" Oprah agrees. ""It doesn't work that way."" ""It doesn't,"" McMillan says. See Tracy McMillan's full interview on this weekend's ""Super Soul Sunday,"" airing Sunday, May 4, at 11 a.m. ET on OWN, during which it also streams worldwide on Oprah.com, Facebook.com/owntv and Facebook.com/supersoulsunday.","McMillan acknowledges that casual sex may work for some people, but strongly advises taking a close look at yourself to determine whether you're one of them."

2719,"The turkey is often viewed as the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving feast. But if the bird is filled with stuffing, the popular side dish could easily come out undercooked, which can result in dangerous bacterial contamination. Rochelle Sirota, RD, CDN, says that stuffing and cooking the turkey could risk the spread of salmonella, a bacterium that is the common cause of foodborne illness. ""It's harder to gauge the heat inside the turkey and you can't really reach all the way inside with a thermometer,"" said Sirota. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receive reports of an average 42,000 cases of salmonellosis -- symptoms of salmonella poisoning that include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps -- but thousands more likely go unreported, according to the CDC website. While most people recover from salmonellosis within a few days, complications such as dehydration or an intestinal infection can be life-threatening, according to the Mayo Clinic. The bacteria is spread through contaminated surfaces, water or food. The primary sources of salmonella are undercooked poultry or eggs, although the bacterium has been linked to vegetables and ground meat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests stuffing be cooked apart from the turkey, especially for cooks who don't use a meat or cooking thermometer. The USDA also advises cooking poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, which will take more time if the bird is stuffed, according to a study from the University of Georgia. Since you have a lot less control over the stuffing when cooked in a bird, Sirota says the smartest and safest choice is to simply cook it separately and serve it as a side. But that's not the only food contamination risk: If you're cooking ahead, be mindful of how far ahead. Sirota suggests cooking the stuffing no longer than four days in advance, as cooking it any longer ahead of time could also increase the risk of bacteria growth. When cooking ahead for Thanksgiving remember to refrigerate foods within two hours of reaching room temperature.","But if the bird is filled with stuffing, the popular side dish could easily come out undercooked, which can result in dangerous bacterial contamination."
2723,"A graphic released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has sparked fears of a massive, Texas-sized ""island"" of toxic debris heading toward the United States from Japan. While the map has certainly provided fodder for catchy -- if slightly cataclysmic -- headlines, it now appears the fears it prompted are overblown. Some talk is making the rounds that there's an ""island of debris"" from Japan coming this way. This is myth ...there's no evidence of a mass! — NOAA Marine Debris (@NOAADebris) November 5, 2013 Stories about a ""toxic monster"" of debris dislodged by the 2011 tsunami in Japan began circulating earlier this week after the NOAA released a map that appeared to show a solid mass of flotsam about 1,700 miles off the Pacific coast, between California and Hawaii. Some outlets were quick to broadcast alarm, with The Independent warning of an ""enormous floating island of debris"" creeping toward the American coast. However, the NOAA has since clarified that while there may have once been 5 million tons of floating debris, 70 percent has since sunk, Salon reports. ""There is no mass ‘flotilla’ of debris headed toward U.S. coasts,"" an NOAA representative assured the outlet, noting that the map's outline merely represents a general area of higher concentration, not solidified mass. The NOAA has since put out a statement that reads, in part: At this point, nearly three years after the earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, whatever debris remains floating is very spread out. It is spread out so much that you could fly a plane over the Pacific Ocean and not see any debris since it is spread over a huge area, and most of the debris is small, hard-to-see objects. This is not to say debris isn't headed for the U.S. In fact, a lot of debris has already landed on American beaches, and the NOAA says it believes there will be more in the future. However, what's hitching rides on that flotsam is of growing concern, Fox reports. ""We’re finding that all kinds of Japanese organisms are growing on the debris,"" John Chapman, a scientist at Oregon State University' Marine Science Center, told the outlet. ""We've found over 165 non-native species so far.... we’d never seen [some of these species] here, and we don’t particularly want [them] here.""","There is no mass ‘flotilla’ of debris headed toward U.S. coasts,"

Here, nutritional therapist Natalie Lamb explains her top five tips to help you achieve your weight loss goals in a healthy way. 1. PROTEIN STAVES OFF HUNGER PANGS The biggest problem when you start to diet is breaking your snacking habit. Over the holidays, as we indulge in cheat day after cheat day, we get used to consuming more calories.  As a result, when you start shrinking your meals down to a healthy, less-indulgent portion, you may feel the urge to nibble between meals.  The best way to avoid that is to focus on the contents of your meals, rather than the size, Lamb says. 'Consume a good quality protein source with each meal or snack to help sustain fullness for longer,' she advises. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that protein triggers the release of 'satiety hormones' - i.e.: the hormones that tell our brain that our stomach is full.  Therefore, a good helping of chicken, beans, egg, or broccoli can help you stave off those hunger pangs.  Lamb adds that Omega 3 fats such as oily fish, nuts and seeds can also help to increase satiety, reduce inflammation and burn off stored body fat. 2. VEG CAN GIVE YOU THE CANDY RUSH YOU CRAVE When we're dehydrated or hungry, our brain visualizes sugar and carbs - quick fixes to the solution.   However, these will do nothing to help sustain your blood sugar.  In fact, vegetables contain all the ingredients you need to give you that kick. 'Swap processed foods high in sugar or refined carbs for real foods such as fibrous colorful vegetables,' Lamb explains. 'It will provide you with more energizing nutrients and less of a sugar dip mid-afternoon.'  That could include arugula, Brussels sprouts, chicory, eggplant, fennel, artichoke hearts, mushroom, lettuce, zucchini, peppers and sauerkraut. Unlike processed carbs like white bread or sugar-laden foods like chocolate, fiber does not use insulin to be digested.  As a result, a diet rich in fiber can help stabilize your blood sugar levels, dampening your constant cravings for a sweet treat.  3. NEVER SKIP A MEAL TO MAKE UP FOR GORGING Millions of people will have woken up today - the day after the Super Bowl - reeling from beer and chicken wings. In a desperate post-indulgence urge to get back on track, you may think skipping breakfast is a good idea.  Wrong, according to Lamb.   'Stick to a regular eating routine so your body can regulate hunger hormones and mood fluctuations,' she insists. A study by Harvard University last year found women who skipped breakfast ran a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and gaining weight. The reason largely boiled down to insulin levels.  Breakfast is (literally) meant to break the fast you had overnight, thereby regulating insulin levels and keeping your blood sugar levels stable.  If you miss that meal, your hormones are likely to go haywire, causing crankiness, hunger pangs, and cravings for caffeine and sugar. You will also through your metabolism out of sync if you habitually switch up your meal times from day to day.  On the flip side, Lamb warns, you do need to be aware of when you need food, and when enough is enough. 'It's important to keep focused and calm when eating to help improve digestion and ensure you notice when you're full!' 4. VISUALIZE YOUR FUTURE Sticking to a new regime is hard, no matter how much or little you have strayed from standard healthy eating habits. Motivation is paramount.  'Focus on your end goal,' Lamb says.  'Remember healthy weight loss is a gradual long term lifestyle shift, not a race.  'Let your friends and family know too so they can support you and encourage you to stay on track, or even join you in cooking and enjoying healthy meals together.' 5. HYDRATION, HYDRATION, HYDRATION  Often, when your body is thirsty, you crave sugar for a boost.  That makes Coca Cola, orange juice, and La-Croix look tantalizing. Really, your body just needs a bit of hydration. 'Try to drink plenty of water,' Lamb says. 'Aim for 6-8 glasses of water every day. 'If you're feeling bored of water, try mixing it up with a slice of fruit or cucumber, or herbal teas such as peppermint or green tea.' ...AND IF YOU NEED SOME HELP  Lamb endorses a fiber supplement as a way to help people get onto the dieting wagon.  The product, Lepicol Lighter, comes as a powder that you dissolve in water and drink before meal times.  It contains glucomannan, a low-calorie plant-based dietary fiber often used to thicken pasta. It has been shown to reduce levels of the hunger hormone grehlin. The second main ingredient is chromium, naturally found in yeast and potatoes, which contributes to the maintenance of normal blood glucose levels. Finally, it contains seven strains of live bacteria to help keep your digestive system healthy. According to Lamb, the product has been shown to aid weight loss, reduce body mass index and blood fat levels, while balancing blood sugar levels.  It is available to purchase online in the UK via the Lepicol website. Thirty sachets cost $17.99. ","Chief among them: a binge is a binge, and no amount of next-day fasting will off-set that."
2728,"It’s been almost three weeks since Pokémon Go came out, and it already has people talking. It is an incredibly immersive game that blends a virtual world with reality with one goal – to catch them all. And it seems that one man has finally managed to do so. New York resident Nick Johnson recently became the first person to announce to have caught all 142 Pokémon in Pokémon Go. His journey spanned two weeks and involved catching 4,269 Pokémon, hatching 303 and walking 95 miles across New York. It’s a dream he’s had ever since he was a kid, and now he’s the first person to boast a collection of 142 Pokémon. ""I’m an avid Pokémon fan. I played a lot as a kid,"" said Johnson. ""But it wasn’t until I caught 135 Pokémon that I thought I should go for this, and see if I could be the first to catch all of them."" ""You want to catch ’em all and become a Pokémon master, the childhood dream, but it never really occurred to me I might be the first one to do it until I got pretty close,"" he said. What’s even more impressive is the fact that he managed to catch them all, while holding a job and maintaining a social life. How did he accomplish this feat in such a short time, you might ask? Well, he had to sacrifice sleep, and lots of it. He was moonlighting as a Pokémon hunter when most people were asleep. The hardest Pokémon he’s ever had to catch was a Porygon by the waters in Jersey City. ""It popped up on my radar, so I ordered an Uber and had the guy drive me around until I found it,"" he wrote in a Reddit comment. However, he managed to catch most of his Pokémon in Brooklyn and Manhattan and because of his job, he’s had to go out on the hunt mostly at night. ""Sometimes they got pretty lengthy into the wee hours of the morning,"" he said. ""Fortunately I tend to function well on short sleep over a short period of time. And with a little black tea."" Even his girlfriend supported his obsession, but not because she enjoyed time alone while he was out catching Pokémon. It was because he agreed to catch Pokémon for her as well. ""I was double-fisting two phones while I was playing,"" he laughed. This is not the end of his journey, however, because there are 151 available Pokémon worldwide, most of which are exclusively available in regions on different continents. He says that in the future he might go on a world Pokémon hunt, but not before he gets some sleep. ""I’m looking to see if I can find a travel company to partner with me or sponsor me,"" he said. ""But now I’m taking a little rest, and catching up on my sleep.""",He was moonlighting as a Pokémon hunter when most people were asleep.
2729,"I know what it's like to be outed. I was outed by the newspaper of record, The New York Times, specifically by Bob Morris in the Style section. When I wrote a letter to Max Frankel, the editor at the time, he asked if I wanted a retraction. No, I replied firmly. Then it would be like a double out. It all happened back in 1993. In truth, I was only out to myself back then, so I was rather mortified. That said, where are lesbians going to get their gossip these days? The L Chat -- ""Lezzie Gossip for the Elizabeth and Bertha in all of us,"" as the website states. Many allegedly closeted people are named and have threads devoted to them, and out lesbians like Ellen Page and Ellen DeGeneres have threads devoted to them as well. Admittedly bisexual Portlandia star and Sleater-Kinney musician Carrie Brownstein also has her own thread. (By the way, Ms. Brownstein was outed by the Times as well). Earlier this year another thread appeared, one devoted to the alleged relationship between Ms. Brownstein and the Orange Is the New Black stunner Taylor Schilling. Is it fair? No. It's just a gossip site, even though The Star reported the same. Until Ms. Schilling comes out, if she happens to be gay, bisexual or fluid, I do believe she has the right to not talk about her personal life on TV shows or in the media. She owes us nothing. That said, where is all this speculation coming from? There are pictures of the two of them hanging out together all over the world, from photos at a museum event, with Ms. Schilling holding the back of Ms. Brownstein's chair, to the recent ones of Ms. Schilling following Ms. Brownstein and her band around Great Britain and Ireland, and the other night to Austin. It has been rumored that Ms. Brownstein dated the singer St. Vincent before that went bust. Many L Chatters assume Ms. Schilling was the catalyst. L Chatters will boo me if I stated that maybe the two are just get-along-really-well gal pals, but I must ask: Are photographs and public sightings of the two together hard proof? Outing has certainly been perfected since the days I was outed. Social media is obviously to blame. But we're losing perspective of human rights. They didn't protect me or Ms. Brownstein, but they should protect Ms. Schilling and everyone else. In the end we all have friends we love to share company with. Ms. Brownstein is a talented writer, musician and actress. Maybe she's a barrel of laughs, as could be Ms. Schilling. And maybe the two just mesh together as pals. And that's where I'll stop. Whatever their relationship is, may they find peace in this suspicious and rather nosy world of ours. We do not know them. As for outing, maybe we'll come to the day when you aren't outed, you just are.","Whatever their relationship is, may they find peace in this suspicious and rather nosy world of ours."
2730,"I walk into the family get -together, mingle with my relatives I haven't seen in a while and make the obligatory small talk with them. Inevitably, as soon as someone I don't know well realizes I'm a senior in high school, they will ask me: ""So, where are you going for college next year?"" By now, I've perfected my answer of uncertainty, so I don't even have to think before responding, ""I'm waiting to hear back from most schools I've applied to, but my top choices are NYU and Northwestern."" Whoever I'm talking to will then invariably make a comment about how their friend's sister went to Northwestern or their aunt lives in New York City; the small talk will awkwardly continue, now that they've exhausted the one obvious conversation topic for anyone my age. There are some people who are supposed to go through the college selection process with you: immediate family members, school counselors, teachers, close friends. It's healthy and natural for them to talk about college with you. However, there are some people who just have no good reason to ask about it. They include, but are not limited to, friends­ of ­friends, people who cut your hair, grocery store checkers and distant second cousins. The question itself is easy enough to answer, even for a senior as uncertain as I am. What bothers me so much is the concept behind the question: that the future is much more important than what's going on right now. The amount of times I've been asked about my college plans far outnumbers the amount of times I've been asked about anything related to high school, and I don't think that's right. It's the beginning of December, and I'd guess that the majority of high school seniors across the country don't yet know where they're going to college next year. I'm envious of the ones who do. Later this month when early decision and early action letters are sent out, more and more seniors will make their decision, but most universities won't send out regular decision letters until March or even April. Personally, I'm nearly done sending in applications and have already received acceptances and scholarship offers from three schools. However, the remaining seven or so decision notifications won't come until March or ""early April,"" as Northwestern University recently told me in an email. Once I do find out where I've been accepted, there will be other factors that impact my decision, the most important being financial aid offers. Especially as the costs of college continue to rise much more quickly than inflation, financial aid is an essential part of the college decision for many seniors. Another thing to consider is that not every high school senior plans on going to college right after graduation, contrary to the assumption in my suburban high school. According to a 2012 survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 66.2 percent of high school graduates across the nation attend college directly after high school. While this is the majority of students, this still means that more than a third have other plans after graduating. Asking a senior about their college plans when they're not planning on going to college could definitely lead to tension. I'm not saying I'm angry with the entire curious adult population, because I know people really do mean well. College is a natural thing to ask a high school senior about, and I've found myself asking other seniors the very question that so exasperates me. It's just extremely frustrating when the thing you're asked about most often is something you can't control and won't be sure of for months. So, what should you ask a high school senior like me instead of the overused questions about college? Ask how my senior year is going so far. Ask me about the activities I'm involved. Ask me about my friends, my job, my family or my classes. Ask me about my life right here and right now. Just please don't ask me where I'm going to college next year, because I'm not sure yet. As soon as I know, I'll let you know.","""So, where are you going for college next year?"""
2732,"Linda Burkhardt was killed by a drowsy driver on her way home from Christmas shopping on December 7, 2012. Her daughter, Ana Burkhardt, 31, of Sumner, Washington, shared her story with The Huffington Post in honor of Drowsy Driving Prevention Week. My mother had been out Christmas shopping for her two very young grandchildren. At the time, one was 4 months and one was 4 years old. She was on her way home when the other driver fell asleep at the wheel after she had left a party. That driver has admitted to the police that she knew she was drowsy when she left the party. The crash happened at 9:41 p.m. Police came to my sister's house, and she notified me. My mom was 55. Prior to the accident, I didn't know anything about drowsy driving. I'm trying to get the word out, by connecting with other families who have lost someone to this. I emailed and called county officials about putting up a sign in memory of my mom [at the site of the accident]. Eventually they told me they would do that and that we could watch them put it up. I also requested other changes. I asked for rumble strips to be put in, and they're working on that now. They repainted the lines on the road, they put in road turtles [raised pavement markers] in the center lanes, and they added signs warning of approaching intersections. It's a very windy, 50 mile-per-hour road. I know by making changes on that road, I've saved someone's life or made someone think they should be more responsible on the road. I would like the law to state that when a drowsy driver admits to being drowsy before they even start driving, they need to be held responsible just as a person who was drinking and driving is. They need to be given more than a fine ... for maiming or killing an innocent person. My sister Alicia and I lost our mom before we were even 30 years old. That driver took Mom away from us. The greatest thing in my mother's life was her grandchildren. She never got to see her granddaughter start school or her grandson's first steps. It breaks my heart that I'll have to explain to my son when he asks, ""Who is the lady in the pictures of me when I'm an infant?"" How do you explain that to a child? She was there for his birth and then there was just so little time.","Linda Burkhardt was killed by a drowsy driver on her way home from Christmas shopping on December 7, 2012.

2733,"When it comes to cooking, garlic is one of my favourite ingredients. And it’s such a versatile ingredient that it can be used in almost any savoury dish! Roasted with some proteins, stir-fried in some vegetables, blended into a creamy pasta sauce.... the list goes on and on. Personally, I absolutely love the flavour and aroma of garlic so when a recipe calls for two cloves of garlic, I’ll somehow justify to myself that I really should be putting in five or six. And the best part is that I don’t feel too guilty about it because garlic is healthy! Garlic can be used to help lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis. This superfood can also be used to help treat the common cold, the flu, bug bites, fungal infections, and traveller’s diarrhoea. Garlic is great for strengthening your immune system while eliminating toxins, leading many people to consume it after chemotherapy. But while I love cooked garlic, garlic in its raw form is apparently how you’re going to get the best results. This is because heating garlic has been shown to reduce its anticancer properties and inactivate a key enzyme called alliinase. What you’ll want to do to maximise the health benefits of garlic is to crush it up raw, releasing the enzymes that will break down into good organosulfur compounds, and then eat it on an empty stomach. But raw garlic is incredibly pungent, so try this... Take 2-3 garlic cloves, chop up and crush them, and mix it with a tablespoon of honey (also healthy with anti-bacterial properties!). If you can consume it this way on a regular basis, it can go a long way in boosting your immune system!","lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure, and prevent cancer, heart attacks, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis"
2734,"The Harry Potter books and film series may be over, but J.K. Rowling‘s Wizarding World continues to live on. There are the short stories and essays published on Pottermore. There is the upcoming film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which explores this familiar universe in a different time and place. And then there is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the ambitious stage play sequel to the original series currently dominating the London theater scene that Warner Bros. says won’t get a film adaptation anytime soon (but go ahead and ask them again in ten years). So when someone asks film series star, Daniel Radcliffe, if he’d be willing to reprise his role as Harry Potter for a new movie, it’s all theoretical. But let’s face it – chances are strong you’re curious about what he says. It’s okay. You’re only human, and a Muggle at that. Radcliffe was in attendance at the Deauville Film Festival, where he was the recipient of the Rising Star Award, and The Hollywood Reporter asked him the big question. Would he say no to another Harry Potter movie down the line? His answer is diplomatic and the exact kind of response you’d expect from a young actor who has grown up carefully navigating the spotlight: I’m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do. But I think I’ll be happy enough and secure enough to let someone else play it. [...] At the moment it’s not even a concern because I’m too young to play the character, but even in 10 years’ time I would still feel strange about going back to it. [...] There’s a part of me that’s like, some things are better left untouched. If we went back to Potter, there’s a chance we’d make what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was to the original Star Wars, but there’s also the chance that we’d make Phantom Menace. So I don’t want to go back to anything like that and maybe sour what people have already loved. In other words, he’d do it as long as it doesn’t stink (a prospect easier said than done). He also adds that Jamie Parker, who plays the older Harry in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on stage, could easily play the character on film. I really liked reading the script for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (and have written all about its similarities to Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and think it’s teeming with cinematic potential. However, a quickly produced film adaptation leaves a lot of money on the table. It’s why you won’t see a Hamilton movie for a long, long time. As long as a stage play is still packing houses and generating demand, you don’t make a film version that lets everyone see it. That’s just basic business. Daniel Radcliffe isn’t taking the thought of another Potter movie seriously yet and neither should you. Besides, Radcliffe is quickly becoming one of our most brave and ambitious actors, playing magical corpses in movies like Swiss Army Man and neo-Nazis in Imperium. Let’s give him some space. Plus, a new Harry Potter movie starring the original cast would be far more satisfying if we wait another decade to let the actors properly age into their older selves.",I’m never going to close the door; that would be a stupid thing to do.
2735,"The ability to provide quality care to patients is what gives doctors job satisfaction, according to a new report that also shows how obstacles to providing such care are a leading source of doctors' stress. ""Many things affect physician professional satisfaction, but a common theme is that physicians describe feeling stressed and unhappy when they see barriers preventing them from providing quality care,"" study researcher Dr. Mark Friedberg, a natural scientist at the nonprofit research organization RAND, said in a statement. ""If their perceptions about quality are correct, then solving these problems will be good for both patients and physicians."" The report was sponsored by the American Medical Association and is based on interviews with 220 doctors from 30 different physician practices across Colorado, Massachusetts, Washington, Texas, North Carolina and Wisconsin, as well as surveys completed by 447 doctors. Researchers found associations between doctor job satisfaction and electronic health records. Among doctors' biggest worries about e-health records were that they would interfere with face-to-face patient interaction and increase clerical work by doctors. Doctors also reported concern about the accuracy of medical reports, because of the template design of some e-health record systems. ""Physicians believe in the benefits of electronic health records, and most do not want to go back to paper charts,"" Friedberg said in the statement. ""But at the same time, they report that electronic systems are deeply problematic in several ways. Physicians are frustrated by systems that force them to do clerical work or distract them from paying close attention to their patients."" The report also showed that job satisfaction was higher among doctors who had more control over their days and how they conducted their patient care, with job satisfaction being higher among doctors in their own practices than those working at hospitals or corporations. Productivity quotas and patient time limitations also contribute to doctor job dissatisfaction, as do too many rules and regulations, the report said.",The ability to provide quality care to patients
2739,"It turns out a substantial chunk of President Donald Trump’s followers on Twitter hail from shadowy, anonymous sources. A just-published investigation of @RealDonaldTrump’s more than 27 million Twitter followers by Bloomberg Businessweek found that about 28 percent are ""eggs."" Literally, that means, for one reason or another, about 7.5 million followers have opted to stick with the default profile illustration, rather than adding their own photo. (Until earlier this month, Twitter’s default illustration was an egg, hence the name.) But in practice, the most suspect account on Twitter is the egg. All too many of these accounts are launched by people who don’t want to be identified or even associated with what they’re saying. ""Eggs"" are the internet equivalent of someone who doesn’t stand by their work. Twitter dropped the icon because it had become synonymous with trolls and bullying. Bloomberg also found that Trump’s most vociferous supporter ― in terms of tweeting at the president ― is probably a bot (although not technically an egg): Trump’s most prolific respondent, @Trump2016_Fan, has posted more than 18,000 times in the past year, mostly all-caps messages of support for the 45th president. The account appears to be automated and did not respond to a request for an interview. Alexander Taub, co-founder of Social Rank, which provided the data to Bloomberg, said none of this should be surprising. Popular Twitter accounts like Trump’s tend to attract fake and otherwise dubious followers. And bots are, as Bloomberg noted, ""a rampant part of life on Twitter."" But for Trump, a man obsessed with crowd size and popularity metrics of all kinds, it does matter ― and for more than just the optics. There’s power in numbers, and the extra millions of supportive eggs and bots can boost his message, even when we don’t know who’s behind them. Sure, people would pay attention to the president’s tweets no matter how many followers he had. But unlike real followers who may dissent from time to time, Twitter eggs (at least many of them) will happily parrot whatever those tweets may be. And Trump’s amplified messages have real-world implications. So real that after his election, Mexican peso traders half-joked that it would be cheaper to buy Twitter outright and shut it down than to continue burning through foreign currency reserves to defend the peso from Trump’s tweets. So real that his baseless tweet accusing former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower has triggered actual investigations. So real that Trump’s repeated, yet unsupported, claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election ignited a flurry of conversation from which even the White House has since distanced itself. The White House seems to understand very well the impact of anonymous voices on the internet. Earlier this week, a Twitter lawsuit revealed that the Trump administration was attempting to force the company to identify the person behind an anonymous account critical of the president. The Trump administration dropped the effort after it went public.","It turns out a substantial chunk of President Donald Trump’s followers on Twitter hail from shadowy, anonymous sources."
2741,"I Am Legend is the 2007 film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, starring Will Smith and a bunch of CG zombie things called Dark Seekers. As questionable as they looked, the irresistible draw of one of Hollywood's most bankable stars ripping around post-apocalyptic New York City proved well worth the ticket price for many filmgoers, making I Am Legend the highest-grossing film of the year. It raked in over $500 million worldwide, and Warner Bros. immediately greenlit a sequel, but it never happened. Here's why. Will Smith never really seemed into it Telling BBC News ""I don't want to be the sequel guy,"" Will Smith didn't have a problem shying away from the next I Am Legend chapter while it was in development. Technically, plans called for a prequel—but Smith had already done Bad Boys II and Men in Black II at this point, which makes his statement seem like a diplomatic way of turning down the role. Even with Smith's caginess, the studio, director Francis Lawrence, and writer Akiva Goldsman set about working on a follow-up. Pressed to define his level of involvement, Smith said, ""I'm not actually working on it. If it's great, I'm into it."" Sounds like the script never achieved that level of greatness, because following Hancock and Seven Pounds, Smith's next project after a four-year hiatus was Men in Black III, which—if we're not mistaken—is a sequel. About that script Presumably, the studio's plans for a prequel over a sequel had a lot to do with the fact that Will Smith's character, Robert Neville, died at the end of the original film, which would make it a tad difficult to pick up the story where it left off. Instead, we were going to see ""the final days of humanity in New York before a man-made virus caused a plague that left Smith's character the lone survivor among a mutated mob in the city."" Which sounds kind of cool, except the first movie already used flashbacks to show the military quarantine of the city, Neville valiantly deciding to stay behind, and then helplessly watching as his wife and daughter die in a helicopter crash during the evacuation. That kind of covers the dramatic beats leading up to his solitary existence in the original film, plus nothing is going to trump the visuals of an eerily desolate New York City. Okay, fine, no prequel. We'll do a sequel somehow—no, a reboot! Roughly four years after the prequel plans hit a dead end, Warner Bros. announced yet another deal with writer Akiva Goldsman to develop a sequel. According to Deadline, ""The film is not being called a prequel, which had been rumored for the past few years."" With Will Smith still not on board, that presumably leaves us following supporting characters Anna and Ethan at the survivor's camp. Nobody wants to watch that, but half a billion in box office grosses don't fade easily from Hollywood's memory, so the next logical step is a reboot. At least they can sell it entirely on name recognition that way, regardless of how disconnected from the original story it might be. And just how far might it wander from the original film? How does ""a sci-fi version of The Searchers"" sound? Yep, we're talking about the John Wayne Western from the 1950s that follows a posse of cowboys on a mission to get revenge and retrieve a kidnapped girl. According to Deadline again, that's where the reboot currently sits, as a ""retrofitted version"" of Gary Graham's script for A Garden at the End of the World that they're slapping the I Am Legend label onto because ""the themes and mythology were similar."" Hey, we heard you love Chipotle. Here's a bunch of Taco Bell burritos smashed into a tortilla and wrapped up in Chipotle foil. Same diff, right? Producer and writer Akiva Goldsman said it will never happen I Am Legend scribe and blockbuster-generator Akiva Goldsman had been the go-to guy for the sequel plans from the beginning, but even he apparently had his doubts about a new installment ever happening. He told io9, ""Oh no no, [there was] never a movie. I mean, we wrote a prequel [and] a sequel,"" which is not only confusing, but also confirms Warner Bros. was open to any possible way to make this thing. But he also said ""Then we did a sequel, that started with Neville again—and you realized that he was cloned."" Oh, cool, so Neville sacrificing himself at the end of the original film didn't matter at all. He also talked about ""a dark seeker elephant,"" because the first movie had dogs, and elephants are bigger! Ultimately, his efforts on the project fizzled, ""It will never happen but we really enjoyed trying to make it happen,"" explained Goldman, who's moved on to projects like Transformers 7 & 8. Zombie fatigue Perhaps the main problem Warner Bros. has had while trying to come up with an idea that seems fresh—while still flying under the banner of an established property—is the fact that there have been approximately a gazillion zombie-related projects since 28 Days Later reignited the genre in 2002. Granted, I Am Legend was one of the more successful zombie flicks out of a solid group that includes Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland, and World War Z, but that was mostly due to its early position in the new zombie wave, as well as Will Smith's star power—both of which have significantly faded in recent years. Yes, The Walking Dead still draws solid ratings, but on the big screen, it's a different story. (For proof, see Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Or don't—no one else did.) As for Smith, he's had a string of duds that'll hopefully be snapped by Suicide Squad. Warner Bros. would be smart to just let this one go. After all...does anything really good ever come from resurrecting the dead? Nobody could handle another scene like when Sam died This is a completely unofficial reason for why this sequel hasn't come to fruition, but we stand by it entirely. We're talking about a general audience's inability to deal with another scene like the death of Sam, Neville's dog. While saving Neville from being torn apart by zombie dogs, she's infected by a bite. Neville's serum can't save her, and he has to strangle her before she turns in one of the most gut-wrenching moments in cinema history. It's amazing that a scene in which a dog dies trumps the emotionality of the scene in which the main character's entire family bites the dust, but that's exactly what happened there. If the sequel/reboot/ whatever-thing they're trying to make has anything that comes close to this, we're not interested—there are only so many tears a popcorn bucket can hold.'","zombie wave, as well as Will Smith's star power—both of which have significantly faded in recent years"

In practice, glitter is so obnoxious and impossible to clean up that you can weaponize tiny shiny sparkles by blasting someone with a glitter bomb. For scientists, glitter remains an object of strange fascination and a legitimate area of research, according to an article on Live Science, because no one is sure how to explain glitter's nefarious cling-ability, at least cleanly. Glitter's made of the polymer you know as Mylar, a polyester film DuPont makes. It's coated with a scintilla of metal to give it that shine, and then pulverized into tiny flakes. Glitter flakes are so little that fairly weak properties of physical chemistry can affect them— for example, they are susceptible to your run-of-the-mill static electricity, probably what's at work when you're trying to brush glitter off most surfaces and failing. Most Popular The fragments' tininess also leave them at the mercy of the air that sits on them; it takes on fluid qualities that make it hard to peel glitter off smooth surfaces. Further, physicists told Live Science, glitter might be adhering to van der Waals forces, the weak electronic interactions that occur between electrically neutral molecules. (It's the same thing that helps water bead, and spiders and geckos cling to walls.) Glitter's surface-to-mass ratio makes it easy for even a faint electrical attraction to hold fast. Which is why, when a glitter bomb detonates, you'll be rounding up shrapnel for days.

2744,"""She instantly started screaming and gagging"" A British mother is warning other parents to be wary of Nurofen after her baby suffered a horrible reaction to the common pain-reliever. Rachel Deakin from Tyldesley in Greater Manchester posted a message on Facebook after her six-month-old daughter Autumn ""instantly started screaming and gagging"" after taking some of the medicine. The mother-of-two explained that she and her husband Shaun both tried the Nurofen afterwards and they too felt a burning sensation in their throats and started coughing. She immediately called a local pharmacist who confirmed that that’s not how the medicine should taste. Deakin contacted Nurofen and the Co-op from which it was bought, and the medicine has now been taken off the shelves. ""Tyldesley Co-op have been fantastic,"" Deakin told Manchester Evening News. ""They instantly responded to my complaint by taking the product off their shelves and by contacting the manufacturer who makes the medicine."" Nurofen are also taking the product for testing. A spokesman for the brand said: ""Nurofen for Children UK has been made aware of a consumer concern regarding a product. ""We are always concerned to hear of an experience that is not as we or our consumers would expect from our products. ""We have been in contact with the consumer and, as per Nurofen protocol, we have requested the product be returned in order to conduct further testing. We are awaiting receipt of the sample."" Fortunately, Autumn is OK as she didn’t swallow much of the medicine, but Deakin found similar complaints from other parents on Nurofen’s Facebook page. ""Luckily, this taste hasn't had any medical impact on my daughter but it was like I'd fed her a chilli, which to me is totally unacceptable,"" Deakin said. ""I am now struggling to get any medication down her as she's refusing to take it, I'm assuming due to what happened last time."" She is advising parents to taste any medicine before giving it to their little ones.",taste any medicine before giving it to their little ones
2747,"In "" In "" How Doctors Die ,"" a powerful essay that went viral in 2011, a physician described how his colleagues meet the end: They go gently. At the end of life, they avoid the mistakes — the intensive, invasive, last-ditch, expensive and ultimately futile procedures that many Americans endure until their very last breath. ""Of course, doctors don’t want to die; they want to live. But they know enough about modern medicine to know its limits,"" Ken Murray wrote. A new study reveals a sobering truth: Doctors die just like the rest of us. ""We went into this with the hypothesis we were going to see very large differences,"" said Stacy Fischer, a physician who specializes in geriatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. ""What we found was very little difference to no difference."" The study in the The study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society examined 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries to bring some hard data to the question. They found that the majority of physicians and non-physicians were hospitalized in the last six months of life and that the small difference between the two groups was not statistically significant after adjusting for other variables. The groups also had the same likelihood of having at least one stay in the ICU during that period: 34.6 percent for doctors vs. 34.4 percent for non-doctors. In fact, doctors spent slightly more time in the ICU than non-doctors, the study found — not enough time to signify a clinical difference, but suggesting that, if anything, doctors may be using medicine more intensively. In one regard, doctors seemed to die slightly better than non-doctors: 46.4 percent of doctors used hospice during their last six months compared with 43.2 percent of non-doctors. Doctors also spent nearly 21⁄2 more days in hospice than non-doctors. But these differences are small, and overall, they are far from the powerful mythology that doctors are dying better than the rest of the populace. ""Doctors are human, too, and when you start facing these things, it can be scary, and you can be subject to these cognitive biases,"" said Daniel Matlock of the University of Colorado School of Medicine. This is striking because it is the opposite of what doctors say they'd prefer. One This is striking because it is the opposite of what doctors say they'd prefer. One survey asked doctors and their patients what treatment course they would choose if they were faced with a terminal illness. Doctors said they would choose less medicine than their patients in almost all cases. Many people have witnessed a death that seemed to be exacerbated by modern medicine: a drug that came with side effects but never seemed to halt the disease's progress, the surgery that was totally unnecessary and might even have sped up someone's death. Doctors have seen that happen even more often. ""Patients generally are not experts in oncology, and yet they have to make decisions without knowing what the whole course of their illness will be,"" Craig C. Earle wrote in the ""Patients generally are not experts in oncology, and yet they have to make decisions without knowing what the whole course of their illness will be,"" Craig C. Earle wrote in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . ""We, on the other hand, have shepherded many patients through this journey toward death."" That's why powerful anecdotes about doctors who die better, whose last moments are spent peacefully and with family, give us hope: There is a better way . But Matlock and Fischer think their data may reveal the odds against the patient, even when the patient is a doctor. The health-care system may simply be set on a course to intervene aggressively. ""These things that encourage low-value care at the end of life are big systems issues,"" Matlock said. ""And a strong, informed patient who knows the risks and benefits — maybe even they have a hard time stopping the train."" There are definite limits to the study: It could not control for differences in education or income among people in the sample. Most of the doctors who died were white men. But the findings may reveal a deep bias that lies at the root of medicine. Fischer pointed out that the entire health-care system is aimed at fixing problems, not giving comfort. For example, a hip replacement the day before someone dies is something the medical system is equipped to handle: Surgeons can schedule it, and health insurance will pay for it. But, Fischer pointed out, if a patient needs less-skilled home care — such as help with feeding and bathing — it's much harder to write a prescription.",Doctors die just like the rest of us
2749,"Kerry Egan is a hospice chaplain and the author of ""On Living,"" and ""Fumbling: A Pilgrimage Tale of Love, Grief, and Spiritual Renewal on the Camino de Santiago."" Talk with Kerry Egan on Facebook Live on CNN Health at 3 p.m. ET Tuesday, December 20. As a divinity school student, I had just started working as a student chaplain at a cancer hospital when my professor asked me about my work. I was 26 years old and still learning what a chaplain did. ""I talk to the patients,"" I told him. ""You talk to patients? And tell me, what do people who are sick and dying talk to the student chaplain about?"" he asked. I had never considered the question before. ""Well,"" I responded slowly, ""Mostly we talk about their families."" ""Do you talk about God? ""Umm, not usually."" ""Or their religion?"" ""Not so much."" ""The meaning of their lives?"" ""Sometimes."" ""And prayer? Do you lead them in prayer? Or ritual?"" ""Well,"" I hesitated. ""Sometimes. But not usually, not really."" I felt derision creeping into the professor's voice. ""So you just visit people and talk about their families?"" ""Well, they talk. I mostly listen."" ""Huh."" He leaned back in his chair. A week later, in the middle of a lecture in this professor's packed class, he started to tell a story about a student he once met who was a chaplain intern at a hospital. ""And I asked her, 'What exactly do you do as a chaplain?' And she replied, 'Well, I talk to people about their families.' "" He paused for effect. ""And that was this student's understanding of faith! That was as deep as this person's spiritual life went! Talking about other people's families!"" The students laughed at the shallowness of the silly student. The professor was on a roll. ""And I thought to myself,"" he continued, ""that if I was ever sick in the hospital, if I was ever dying, that the last person I would ever want to see is some Harvard Divinity School student chaplain wanting to talk to me about my family."" My body went numb with shame. At the time I thought that maybe, if I was a better chaplain, I would know how to talk to people about big spiritual questions. Maybe if dying people met with a good, experienced chaplain they would talk about God, I thought. Today, 13 years later, I am a hospice chaplain. I visit people who are dying -- in their homes, in hospitals, in nursing homes. And if you were to ask me the same question -- What do people who are sick and dying talk about with the chaplain? -- I, without hesitation or uncertainty, would give you the same answer. Mostly, they talk about their families: about their mothers and fathers, their sons and daughters. They talk about the love they felt, and the love they gave. Often they talk about love they did not receive, or the love they did not know how to offer, the love they withheld, or maybe never felt for the ones they should have loved unconditionally. They talk about how they learned what love is, and what it is not. And sometimes, when they are actively dying, fluid gurgling in their throats, they reach their hands out to things I cannot see and they call out to their parents: Mama, Daddy, Mother. What I did not understand when I was a student then, and what I would explain to that professor now, is that people talk to the chaplain about their families because that is how we talk about God. That is how we talk about the meaning of our lives. That is how we talk about the big spiritual questions of human existence. We don't live our lives in our heads, in theology and theories. We live our lives in our families: the families we are born into, the families we create, the families we make through the people we choose as friends. This is where we create our lives, this is where we find meaning, this is where our purpose becomes clear. Family is where we first experience love and where we first give it. It's probably the first place we've been hurt by someone we love, and hopefully the place we learn that love can overcome even the most painful rejection. This crucible of love is where we start to ask those big spiritual questions, and ultimately where they end. I have seen such expressions of love: A husband gently washing his wife's face with a cool washcloth, cupping the back of her bald head in his hand to get to the nape of her neck, because she is too weak to lift it from the pillow. A daughter spooning pudding into the mouth of her mother, a woman who has not recognized her for years. A wife arranging the pillow under the head of her husband's no-longer-breathing body as she helps the undertaker lift him onto the waiting stretcher. We don't learn the meaning of our lives by discussing it. It's not to be found in books or lecture halls or even churches or synagogues or mosques. It's discovered through these actions of love. If God is love, and we believe that to be true, then we learn about God when we learn about love. The first, and usually the last, classroom of love is the family. Sometimes that love is not only imperfect, it seems to be missing entirely. Monstrous things can happen in families. Too often, more often than I want to believe possible, patients tell me what it feels like when the person you love beats you or rapes you. They tell me what it feels like to know that you are utterly unwanted by your parents. They tell me what it feels like to be the target of someone's rage. They tell me what it feels like to know that you abandoned your children, or that your drinking destroyed your family, or that you failed to care for those who needed you. Even in these cases, I am amazed at the strength of the human soul. People who did not know love in their families know that they should have been loved. They somehow know what was missing, and what they deserved as children and adults. When the love is imperfect, or a family is destructive, something else can be learned: forgiveness. The spiritual work of being human is learning how to love and how to forgive. We don't have to use words of theology to talk about God; people who are close to death almost never do. We should learn from those who are dying that the best way to teach our children about God is by loving each other wholly and forgiving each other fully -- just as each of us longs to be loved and forgiven by our mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.","the love they felt, and the love they gave"

""Lupin's condition of lycanthropy was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS,"" Rowling writes. ""All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes."" Remus Lupin alienated himself from the world because of his condition. He became a werewolf on his fifth birthday, as detailed in the short story about his life found in Heroism, Hardship, and Dangerous Hobbies, as well as on Pottermore. Remus's father, Lyall Lupin, encountered a werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, during his time working for the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He knew Greyback to be a werewolf upon sight, but the other members of the Ministry did not believe him. They teased Lyall, who grew angry and described werewolves as ""soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death."" Greyback heard these comments, and when the Ministry released him from custody, he plotted his revenge again Lyall Lupin. The werewolf journeyed to the Lupin's house, opened Remus' window and attacked the boy. Because the Greyback bit him in his wolfish form during the full moon, Remus was infected. Lyall greatly regretted what he had said about werewolves. His son was the same as always — he wasn't evil or soulless, but clever and kind and smart. Still, Lyall decided to keep his son's condition a secret. The family moved constantly, upending their lives each time someone caught wind of the situation. ""Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition,"" Rowling writes. ""In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy."" His loneliness persisted, until one day a wizard named Albus Dumbledore arrived on his parents' doorstep and invited him to attend Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, he made true friends — James Potter and Sirius Black — who learned his secret and loved him unconditionally. After their death, he returned to his solitary ways, but he eventually found a home with his family, Tonks and Teddy. In a separate section of the book, Rowling details the difficulties of living with lycanthropy. She doesn't discount the challenges of his condition, but she emphasizes that he lived an amazing life despite the difficulties— he had a wife, a son, wonderful friends, and a mission. We know, of course, how his story ends. Though his life was hard and much too short, he lived it brilliantly. Images: Warner Bros.

2772,"Christmas wouldn't be the same without a few arguments, but one woman may well have taken things too far after throwing her son out for failing to buy her a card.  The mother made the revelation on Mumsnet, explaining she was aggrieved when her adults son donated to charity instead of giving her a card with her Christmas gift. After an argument she told her son to leave and take the presents he'd given, admitting that her grandchildren were very upset by this.   Her fellow forum users were outraged, with one accusing her of acting like a 'brat', and telling her she needed to apologise to her son.   Going by the handle user1482716073 the woman explained in the post titled 'To have expected a card?', that she received a Christmas card from 'all of her children bar one' - her son who was spending the festive day with her and the rest of the family. 'We swapped presents and then I raised the issue of the card. I told him how upset I was not to get a card from him 'He told me that he wasn't doing cards this year and had made a charity donation. I wasn't happy as I expected a card and thought this was a cop out.' Later, she came across her son sitting alone in another room and when she asked him why he was sulking, it escalated into a blazing row. And if the woman was hoping other Mumsnet users would empathise, she did not get the reaction sh was looking for. MavisTheTwinklyToreador couldn't believe she had a tantrum and made her own child feel unwelcome 'over a piece of paper'.  'Grow up and consider how you made him feel,' she said.  Another user told the woman that she had 'overreacted massively and owe your son an apology', adding that if she was her mother she would reconsider a relationship with her. 'You are being an absolute brat,' another commented as well as urging her to apologise. She received a hint of understanding from Someonestolemynick who conceded it was 'a little shifty' of her son not to buy a card, knowing how much they mean to his mother.  However, she concluded that the mother's reaction was much worse.  'You asked him to leave because you didn't get your own way?' she siad. 'If I was your son I would be reconsidering my relationship with you.'  Many more agreed that the user was being unreasonable, but she stood firm and even tried to defend her actions. 'I know it was just a card but it's the unthoughtfulness that upset me. It's a small thing that shows people care. I picked out a really special card for my son. 'I don't think the row was my fault as my son didn't need to sulk and he got angry quite quickly.'",You behaved like a spoiled brat': Mother is blasted for throwing her son out of the house because he didn't give her a card on Christmas Day (even though he brought a gift

2777,"You might think it is cute to snap a photo of your toddler running around in a playground or having a temper tantrum for social media, but did you ever think it might be a mistake, or even illegal? The French Government earlier this year warned parents to stop posting images of their children on social media networks. Under France's rigorous privacy laws, parents could face penalties of up to a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ($65,500) if convicted of publicising intimate details of their children without their consent. This new legality is powerful food for thought for parenting in the Facebook era. As adults, we often express dissatisfaction at the ways young people post their lives online. But if we turn the mirror on ourselves, do we as parents actually have the right to make our family photos public? If so, which ones? Part of the issue is our tendency for over-sharing. A recent study by Nominet, which handles the UK's .uk domain name registry, found parents post nearly 200 photos of their under fives online every year. This means that a child will feature in about 1,000 online photos before their fifth birthday. We have even got to the point where if you don't upload photos of your baby, others question whether you are a committed parent. This new norm means many children will have a powerful digital identity created by someone else. This process can be likened to the manufacturing of celebrity identities, where parents can potentially shape the public persona of their child in any way they want: child genius, disobedient, fashionista, fussy eater and so on. How do you think your own mum or dad might shape your online identity? Do you think it would be an accurate portrayal of who you are? There is also the issue of likes and comments on those photos. Without realising it, are we choosing to upload posts about our kids that we hope will get the most audience attention? If so, how is this skewing the identity we are shaping for them? We often tell our kids that once something is on the internet it is there forever, and this is a core concern for kids. Research shows that parents often have not considered the potential reach and the longevity of the digital information that they are sharing about their child. Your child will not have much control over where that home video of her having an embarrassing first singing lesson ends up or who sees it. And for this generation of kids, the publicising of their lives can start even before they are born, when parents broadcast photos to all their friends and their friends' friends of the antenatal scan. Parents' actions are generally not maliciously intended. In fact, they actually often see they are exposing something personal about their own life in such posts rather than that of their child. There is also benefit from such sharing. Posts about your child bed-wetting might help a friend find solutions, or boost their patience for dealing with a similar issue with their own child. Many parents find this community of support important. Given the relative youth of social media, it is hard to say exactly how growing up online could affect children's privacy, safety and security. But social media has also been around long enough now — Facebook is now 14 years old — that it is important to seriously consider the issue. It is time to question how individuals — both children and adults — should manage boundaries around sharing personal information, and how they can control information that is shared about them. Posting embarrassing photos of others on Facebook without consent is definitely tricky territory, but what constitutes embarrassing is slightly different for everyone, which makes this new issue even more of a minefield. The answer of how to approach this new-found issue might be to listen to what kids have to say about it. Recent research from the University of Michigan asked children and parents to describe the rules they thought families should follow related to technology. Adults tend to think of these rules around how much time kids spend on screen, but about three times more children than parents thought there should be rules about what parents share and do not share on social media. Many kids said parents should not post anything about them online without asking them. Both children and parents considered positive images, events and news more appropriate to share than negative ones. An image of the child playing on the swings at the park is a lot less likely to resurface than a YouTube video of them having a tantrum because their breakfast is not in their favourite bowl. If you're a parent looking for advice or sympathy about a behavioural problem, then a community approach is still very helpful, just do not post an image and your child's name as part of the post. This will help to limit the searchability and reach of it. Asking your children's consent is also part of the issue and part of the solution. Asking if your child likes the photos of them and whether you can put it up online can be a very quick and respectful conversation. It also sets up a great approach to your kids understanding digital etiquette. Parents sharing photos of their kids online is not only about digital identity. It is also about our obsession with taking photos of our kids, particularly when they shine (or do not shine) in their respective activities. This can make kids feel pressured to perform to help mum and dad get the right snap to share. What the children really want to see is you taking notice of them and acknowledging that they and their actions are important.

2778,"Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the light as emanating from within a black hole, rather than beside it. Corrections have been made to reflect this small but important distinction. In the epitomizing blackness of space, few natural phenomena can compete with the darkness of black holes. After all, with their inexorable gravitational pull, nothing, not even light, can be seen ... right? Well, mostly. Last week, for the first time ever, scientists observed visible light emanating from beside a black hole with nothing more than a 20 cm. telescope. Apparently, the rather beautiful phenomena occurs when, as the Guardian explains , ""material from surrounding space falls into them and releases violent bursts of light."" Essentially, when some matter is sucked into one of these massive pits of gravity, they emit an incredible amount of energy, which can manifest itself as light. When this happens, it looks like we’re seeing light coming out of a black hole. Back in June of 2015 , a team of scientists led by Mariko Kimura of Kyoto University, became the first to ever see this sort of light through a telescope when a black hole named V404 Cygni, one of the closest to planet Earth, began showing activity after lying dormant for 26 years. Around every six and a half days, Cygni and its partner star (a celestial body a bit smaller than the sun) would circle one another, and when the black hole came to life again, it began feasting on the star. For two weeks, the astronomers were able to see flashes of light — some lasting just minutes, while others continued for several hours — as Cygni worked its magic.","Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the light as emanating from within a black hole, rather than beside it."
2782,"In Colorado, where recreational marijuana cut its teeth in 2014, marijuana sales are already eclipsing an annualized $1 billion pace, and that's translating into a nine-figure payday for Colorado's Department of Revenue. In April, Colorado collected $13 million in cannabis taxes and fees. April's take puts the state on pace to collect $156 million in cannabis taxes and fees over the next 12 months, but Colorado's total haul from marijuana next fiscal year (which begins July 1) is likely to be a lot more than that. Why? Because marijuana sales continue to grow. In the current fiscal year, Colorado has collected $125 million in marijuana taxes and fees, up 55% from the same time last year. Colorado's success bodes well for other states considering recreational marijuana laws this fall. Voters in the Golden State will take up the issue of recreational marijuana in November; if the measure is OK'd, then taxes and fees generated by cannabis in California could dwarf Colorado's figures. California's state government reported in December that annual marijuana taxes and fees associated with recreational marijuana could total in the ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and that they could potentially be as high as $1 billion. That tax revenue would come largely from a 15% sales tax on marijuana, but it would also come from marijuana cultivation taxes of $9.25 per ounce for dried marijuana flowers, and $2.75 per ounce for dried marijuana leaves. California could also see an uptick in state income tax revenue as black-market marijuana producers and sellers come out of the shadows. The state's ramp in marijuana tax revenue could be faster than Colorado's, too. California pioneered medical marijuana laws in the 1990s, so there are nearly 1,000 medical marijuana dispensaries already open for business. Applications for recreational marijuana licenses by medical marijuana dispensaries in California will get preference, so many of these shops could begin serving customers quickly. The state shouldn't have difficulty getting enough supply to meet demand, either. California's marijuana culture is well established and California is by far the biggest indoor and outdoor producer of marijuana in the country. California grows four times more marijuana every year than Tennessee, the second highest-producing state. Most of that marijuana is grown in a thinly populated area in the northern part of the state called the Emerald Triangle. The Emerald Triangle is thought to be the largest marijuana-producing area in both the U.S. and the world. Legalizing cannabis could also have a big and positive impact on California tourism. A Google search of Colorado marijuana tours yields 435,000 results, and in December, the Denver Post reported that Colorado's my420tours handles between 120 and 200 tourists per week. A survey conducted last year by Denver's Department of Tourism found that 22% of Colorado tourists said marijuana was ""extremely influential"" in planning their trips to visit the state. California's Napa Valley hosts more than 3 million wine lovers every year, and those visitors spend more than $1.6 billion annually in the region. Could tourism in the Emerald Triangle eclipse those figures? Only time will tell. But if it does, then marijuana's impact on California's coffers may extend far beyond the marijuana taxes and fees the state collects.

2787,"Sometimes, public bathrooms are a necessary evil, especially during long car rides or when nature calls inconveniently.  Though most are pretty pristine, every once in a while, we run into some truly unsavory public bathroom situations.  We have no idea who has been in there before us, and sometimes, we just can’t help but feel wary of public toilets, considering all of the crazy things that have been found in them.  When these feelings of insecurity strike, we usually reach for the nearest available seat cover and — if one isn’t available — we then make one of our own out of toilet paper.  This lifehack may seem like a perfectly harmless, even safe, practice. But in truth, creating this protective paper barrier could be doing you way more harm than good. Studies have found that where we perceive bacteria thriving in bathrooms can be completely backwards, and what we use to keep us clean could actually be spreading the problem around! Read below to learn how bacteria is spread in all bathrooms, and what steps we should be taking to keep scary bathroom germs at bay! There is a general misconception that covering toilet seats keeps you safe from germs. But toilet seats are actually designed to keep as much bacteria off of you as possible. According to Today.com, germs are not easily spreadable on toilet seats, since many different bacteria and viruses don’t survive long outside of a human body. Their special shape and material were specifically designed to prevent bacteria from dwelling on their surface for very long. Despite this, many people opt to line the seat with toilet paper — but really, this seemingly clean practice may actually be increasing your exposure to germs. Toilet paper, unlike toilet seats, are not designed to ward off bacteria. In fact, they’re sponges for it. With every flush, germs are sprayed up and out of the toilet — and often exposed right onto the toilet paper. But toilet paper isn’t the only place where germs dwell more happily than toilet seats. In fact, a study from the the Journal of Applied Microbiology found that hand dryers were among the largest distributors of bacteria, other than flushing toilets. The powerful buffeting of dryers propels germs around the room and onto your hands, which can grow and increase, especially if you don’t dry them completely! Though they are definitely more environmentally friendly, these dryers actually spread more germs than ordinary paper towels. So what’s the best way to ensure you’re not spreading or picking up germs? Closing the toilet seat lid before flushing! If the toilet doesn’t have a lid, remember that bacteria thrives in warm, wet places, so keep any surface dry, including your hands, your body, and any of the bathroom appliances. Washing your hands is extremely important after you use the restroom, but drying them thoroughly and disposing of your paper towels is just as important. Our skin does a great job of blocking bacteria, so trust in its ability to do its job when sitting on a dry toilet seat. As long as you remain aware of where bacteria is actually present, you can make smart decisions toward remaining healthy, happy, and free of more germs than are necessary!","not designed to ward off bacteria.

2790,"Instagram Stories has brought Instagram and Snapchat into direct competition. And while Snapchat has the cachet of being the originator of the Stories format, the closed nature of its platform means that it lacks the same network effects as Instagram. If Snapchat wants to succeed against Instagram in the long-run – in both the domain of ephemeral sharing and more broadly in social media – then it might need to take a leaf from its rival's Instagram page and emulate the open-nature of its network. Network effects cause a product's value to compound as more users buy in. Every successful social platform (including Snapchat) owes its prosperity to network effects. As more users sign up, there are more people to connect with and more content to interact with. This increases the benefits of being the platform, which keeps existing users on platform and attracts new sign ups. On the other hand, flailing social networks fall short because ""they never caught on"" and hit critical mass, while extinct social networks die out when no one uses their platform anymore. The openness of Instagram's platform and its superior user base give it a key advantage over Snapchat. Instagram counts over 300 million daily active users (DAUs), almost double that of Snapchat. Users on Instagram can thus potentially tap into a much larger audience. Moreover, Instagram's platform is open and encourages the discoverability of new content, which helps the audience-building endeavor. In contrast, Snapchat's is more closed and difficult to find content on unless you already know exactly where to look.",lacks the same network effects as Instagram

The network has signed a deal with the comedian and late-night host through 2017, effectively ending speculation that he might take over for Stewart.

Of all the human beings on the planet Earth right now, the person who is second-most qualified to host The Daily Show after Jon Stewart is John Oliver. After all, he did so terrifically for the entire summer of 2013. But, as we now know, he was so good that he ended up getting a show with HBO called Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. And, as we've now seen, he's not going to leave that show to do The Daily Show. Nobody leaves HBO The original deal Oliver signed with HBO — as outlined in this revealing profile by the Hollywood Reporter — is for two years, complete creative freedom, and no ratings pressure. It now runs for an additional two years, through 2017. This is the golden goose of TV deals, the thing that everybody who works in the industry wants, and it's with a network that carries with it tons of cachet for its many years of quality programming. Make no mistake: one of the big reasons Last Week Tonight with John Oliver jumped on the scene so quickly was because it was so good. But the other was that it was on HBO, a network that knows how to promote and support its content, and a network that TV reporters and critics will always pay attention to, thanks to its long history of success. Oliver's deal was signed in 2013, so it was originally up this year. If HBO had been unhappy with Oliver, or if Oliver had been unhappy with HBO, Comedy Central would have a shot at getting him back on The Daily Show. But that wasn't the case, and HBO had good reason to move quickly to lock Oliver down. His show appeared on many ""best TV of 2014"" lists (including ours), and the program has made HBO competitive in a market where it's really only had Real Time with Bill Maher for years. Last Week Tonight should also be hugely competitive at the Emmys, and that's something HBO cares about as well. Finally, there's the simple fact that what Last Week Tonight does is so different from what everybody else in the late-night game is doing. Oliver's show may be filled with quips, but there's often actual reporting backing up his famous segments on topics like net neutrality or Big Pharma. And that's because of the luxury of creative control and only having to do the show one time a week. Once a show is on the daily grind, it has to, by the very nature of the beast, turn into jokes about the day's headlines. So would Oliver taking over The Daily Show have been great? For sure. But it's not going to happen — and thanks to that, we'll ideally have two great late-night shows, instead of just the one.","he ended up getting a show with HBO called Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.

The suspension depends upon the seriousness of the offence and can last from 15 days to several years.

2811,"If you only read one thing: The parlor game at the GOP convention last month didn’t center on the possibilities for it if Donald Trump won the White House. Instead it was what would happen if he loses—the likelier outcome according to polls, at least this week. Would Trump blame the GOP establishment for being insufficiently supportive, as the RNC and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan fear? Would he blame social conservatives for staying home, as Sen. Ted Cruz has wagered? Trump offered his first clue Monday when he declared at a rally in Ohio that he feared that the election would be ""rigged"" against him. He offered no proof other than the Democratic National Committee’s private efforts to back Hillary Clinton in the primary revealed in the recent email hack. The suggestion that the election could be fixed marks the latest upending of electoral norms by Trump, calling into question the very legitimacy of the campaign system. After Bush v. Gore, Democrats raised hell over the notion that the 2000 campaign was undemocratically decided, but that was by a co-equal branch of government. Trump’s assertion puts another obstacle in the way of unity after this most bitter campaign, as he and his supporters lay the groundwork to declare without evidence that the White House was ""stolen"" from him.

According to her campaign she will report holding $58 million in the bank. Trump has yet to report his numbers. Clinton spent Monday in Omaha, where she is looking to pick up Nebraska’s second congressional district’s Electoral College vote.

2825,"[ NOTE: Answers to some common questions and comments about this research work can be found here: ""The Froome descent aerodynamic analysis and subsequent debate: The day after."" https://lnkd.in/eivPkQU on LinkedIn] [DISCLAIMER: Linked In posts about research evidently are only a summary of the research project, only presenting some of the main findings. Full details of the work will be published in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal and announced as soon as the publication process is finalized] In stage 8 of the Tour de France (2016), probably the most remarkable event was the way in which Chris Froome descended the Peyresourde towards the finish line, took a 13"" lead on Nairo Quintana, Adam Yates, Bauke Mollema and his other competitors, from which he broke away just before the top of the Peyresourde, and won the stage. Figure 1 shows Chris Froome during his descent, sitting on the top tube, with his chest on the handlebar. During the descent he was alternatively pedaling and holding the legs fixed. The descent covered 15.5 km, from an altitude of 1569 m to 632 m. Froome reached an average speed of 62.5 km/h and a maximum speed of 90.9 km/h. Figure 1. Froome in the descent of the Peyresourde, sitting on the top tube. Source: www.sporza.be This rather uncommon descent position received huge media coverage, and many have attributed the 13"" lead to the more aerodynamic position of Froome compared to that of his competitors. While many have applauded Team Sky and Chris Froome for adding spice to the race, others have criticized them for implicitly having promoted this rather dangerous position in professional (and maybe even recreational) cycling. Indeed, this position puts the majority of the weight on the front wheel and severely reduces steering capability. However, the question is: was it really this position on the bike that led to the win of the stage and the 13"" lead? We try to give the answer below. In the past week, researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, KU Leuven and University of Liege in Belgium and ANSYS International have joined forces to aerodynamically analyze the ""Froome position"", as we will call it, and compare it to other positions. First, scanning was performed to provide the geometry of a cyclist in four different positions: first the two main positions of interest: the ""Froome position"" and a safer but also very aerodynamic position, with the cyclist on the saddle, which we will simply call ""safer descent position"". These two positions are shown in Figure 2a and 2b. In addition two reference positions were added: the time trial position with arms stretched and hands and arms on the time trial bar, generally considered to be most aerodynamic, and the upright position with hands on top of the handlebar, generally considered to be least aerodynamic. Figure 2c and 2d show the latter two positions. Figure 2. The four cyclist positions analyzed. Sources: www.cyclingweekly.co.uk; www.iamcycling.ch; www.sporza.be; www.usatoday.com Next, numerical simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with ANSYS Fluent were performed. First, high-resolution computational grids were generated for the four cyclist positions. The steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved with the standard k-epsilon model for closure. Near-wall modeling was performed with scalable wall functions. This methodology has been extensively validated by us in other cycling aerodynamics studies in the past using wind tunnel measurements (Defraeye et al. 2010, Blocken et al. 2013, Blocken and Toparlar 2015, Blocken et al. 2016). The results are presented in Figure 3, which shows the ranking of the positions from most to least aerodynamic. The subfigures in the left column show the pressure coefficient contours on the cyclist bodies, the middle column shows quantitative information on the increase in aerodynamic drag relative to the time trial position, and the right column shows the photographs of the four positions. The following observations can be made. The ""Froome"" position is not aerodynamically better, but slightly worse than the ""safer descent position"", albeit with a very slight margin of 0.6% in terms of air resistance (drag force). The ""safer descent position"" is only slightly worse than the time trial position. Note however that the time trial cyclist is sitting quite upright and his aerodynamic position is less favorable. The upright position is clearly the worst, with 19.9% more air resistance than the time trial position. Figure 3. Ranking of the four cyclist positions analyzed, from most to least aerodynamic. The subfigures in the left column show the pressure coefficient contours on the cyclist body. The next logical question is: what then was the reason why Chris Froome took a 13"" lead in his descent? The first part of the answer is stating that this question is poorly posed. Indeed, he did not take the full 13"" lead in only the descent, but he already took a rather big lead by accelerating before the top of the Peyresourde, as shown in Figure 4. And if you start descending while others are still climbing, you can develop quite a lead at the finish line. Figure 4. Froome taking a lead before the start of the descent of the Peyresourde. Source: www.sporza.be Actually, it is very remarkable that his competitors made the mistake to allow him to take this lead. Froome used the element of surprise, in a masterful way. Next, he took additional time in the largest part of the descent. Given the results of the CFD simulations, this would mean that the position of the leader chaser, Nairo Quintana included, was less aerodynamic than the ""Froome position"", hence also less aerodynamic than the ""safer descent position"" in Figure 3. Indeed, Figure 5 shows the very limited available footage of the chasers, where the lead chaser seems to be in a more upright position, certainly not as aerodynamic as the ""safer descent position"", which corresponds to a horizontal position of the back. Finally, at the very end of the race, the chasers hesitated for a while, after which they took some time back, yielding the final gap of 13"". Figure 5. Photographs of the descent, with the lead chaser more upright on the bicycle than the ""safer descent position"" where the back of the rider is almost horizontal. Source: www.sporza.be Answering the question in the title: ""Fantastic downhill from Chris Froome; but was it worth it? The answer is both ""YES"" and ""NO"", which indicates that also this question was poorly posed. YES, because it was worth to take the lead in the descent and win the stage this way, for several reasons. Froome had the reputation of being less good downhill, and he provided quite the spectacle here to demonstrate his skills. In addition, Team Sky had imposed on itself the mission to add spice to the race, which they did successfully at the end of stage 8. Last but not least, a Tour de France can be won and lost based on a few seconds – although this will probably not be the case this year – and Froome did not yet wear the yellow jersey at the start of stage 8. NO, because the ""Froome position"" – as opposed to common perception – is not more aerodynamic than a more common and safer position with the cyclist sitting on the saddle and bent forward with the head close to the handlebar. The distance between cyclist body and bicycle frame and between cyclist body and the ground is not a factor of importance in terms of aerodynamics. Finally, some brief calculations can be made based on the CFD simulation results to link percentages in drag reduction to time differences. Assuming an average speed of 62.5 km/h over the 15.5 descent, 13"" corresponds to an aerodynamic drag difference of 2.5 to 3%. This seems to make sense and in line with the results in Figure 3 given the fact that the position of the lead chaser in Figure 5 is more upright than the ""safer descent position"". COMMENTS: Although we called it the ""Froome position"", this position was already used by other riders in the past, including Tony Martin in the Vuelta of 2013. The cyclist that was scanned and involved in the simulations was neither Chris Froome, nor any other professional cyclist acting in the Tour de France. The cyclist we scanned has similar body height and weight as Chris Froome, but a slightly different position on the bike, with a more flat back, as opposed to the larger curvature in the back of Chris Froome. Therefore, it is not unlikely that the use of other cyclist bodies would result in slightly different percentages than shown in Figure 3. However, the ""Froome position"", taken be any athlete, will always be less aerodynamic than the safer descent position. This is clear from logical reasoning based on frontal areas. The logical reasoning can be made in only three sentences: 1) Most aerodynamic position is when the body (waste + torso + neck + head) is as horizontal as possible (or on inclined road: as much as possible parallel to the road). 2) If you sit on the top tube, a horizontal position of the back means that your head should be where the handlebar is, this is impossible. 3) Froome position therefore always gives more upright body position and more drag. In many previous aerodynamic tests of riders sitting on the saddle, including those on You Tube, the body (waste + torso + neck + head) was not horizontal, but either having a clear positive or negative inclination. That obviously increases the frontal area, and does not provide a fair comparison to the Froome position. That being said, every rider has a different position on the bike, and probably riders will have to practice both the Froome position and the safer descent position to employ both of them optimally.

The comedy-drama hybrid about the housing crisis and financial crash of 2008 starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt , is certain to have people talking. Based on the book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short tells the true story of a group of men — some Wall Street bankers, some not — who decided to flip the script and bet against the housing market before the crash. The film, which repeatedly breaks the fourth wall, looks larger than life, but all the big name stars in the film play characters based on real people, including Pitt, who stars as retired banker Ben Rickert. Rickert is actually based on Ben Hockett, a banker who joined forces with his neighbors Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley in establishing Cornwall Capital Management, an investment fund that struck gold with their bets against the housing market. So, what does the real Ben think of The Big Short Hockett hasn't spoken out about the film yet, so it's unclear how he feels about being immortalized on film and I'm not sure we'll ever know his take because the real Hockett has kept his distance from the spotlight, and is now a survivalist living a quiet life in Berkeley, Calif.

According to Pitt's interview with Vulture, Hockett lives in a home that is impossible to access by car . Given Hockett's solitude, I'd wager that it's unlikely he'd approve of being made into a product of Hollywood. It might seem like anybody lucky enough to be played by Pitt in a movie wouldn't have anything to complain about, but, to be fair, Pitt's turn as Ben Rickert in The Big Short isn't the actor's most glamorous turn. Dressed in ill-fitting suits with clear glasses and a grey beard, Pitt embraced the look of a bored professional for the film. Still, despite any makeunders, it's hard to think that Pitt's casting would be a point of contention. It's more likely that Hockett would be concerned with how audiences respond to the character of The Big Short can be seen as a story about underdogs and outcasts who beat the system. This narrative of the regular guy profiting off of the corruption of big banks is certainly how The Big Short is being sold to audiences, as evidenced by the early trailers released for the film.

2839,"From Mother Nature Network's Jaymi Heimbuch: Some of the best habitats in North America for salamanders are showing strain from climate change, becoming warmer and drier as global temperatures and weather patterns shift. This means the salamanders living there, which rely on cool, moist forests, are also experiencing changes. Forced to burn more energy to deal with the changing clime, the salamanders are getting smaller in average size. Research from the University of Maryland, published yesterday in the journal Global Change Biology, shows that the predictions by scientists that some animals will deal with climate chance by getting smaller is panning out among salamanders. The research team ""examined museum specimens caught in the Appalachian Mountains from 1957 to 2007 and wild salamanders measured at the same sites in 2011-2012. The salamanders studied from 1980 onward were, on average, 8% smaller than their counterparts from earlier decades. The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations – settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most,"" reports UMD. For example, an Appalachian species that has become significantly smaller over the last few decades is the Northern gray-cheeked salamander, pictured above. But this is just one of several species, and the rate of change is startling. Where the climate is getting warmer and dryer, salamanders are having to burn around 7-8 percent more energy than their forebearers to stay equally as active, and it results in each generation of salamanders being about 1 percent smaller than their parents. ""This is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal,"" said Karen R. Lips, an associate professor of biology at the University of Maryland and the study’s senior author. ""We don’t know exactly how or why it’s happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change ... We don’t know if this is a genetic change or a sign that the animals are flexible enough to adjust to new conditions. If these animals are adjusting, it gives us hope that some species are going to be able to keep up with climate change."" That hope is key, since salamanders and other amphibians, most notably frog species, are facing serious challenges to surviving in rapidly changing habitats. Lips notes that the resulting changes could mean that the salamanders spend more time foraging for food and less time looking for mates, which may mean having fewer young and being more vulnerable to predators. But whether the salamanders successfully adapt or decline is yet to be discovered.",Forced to burn more energy to deal with the changing clime

You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus. Answer by Ambra Benjamin, engineering recruiter: Big disclaimer: I am just one lowly recruiter. There are a lot of other people in my profession, and I don't speak for us all. But what I'm about to say is what I feel is an accurate sample size of what most of my peers in my field can all agree on. Hard truth on this one: absolutely not. Not only do we not usually read them, most of the time we don't even open that attachment or give cover letters a cursory glance. It's such a waste of time. Many companies have even stopped asking for them altogether. But I'll tell you who does read cover letters: hiring managers. Not all. In fact, a lot don't, but in the entire hiring equation, were I to assign likelihood, a hiring manager is more prone to read the cover letter than anyone else involved. And even then, I'd add another factor that narrows the field: a hiring manager at a small company with lower hiring volume (like a small nonprofit) is more likely to read a cover letter than a hiring manager at companies like Amazon or KPMG. In my opinion, if you want your cover letter to be read, do these things: Don't apply online, but email your résumé to a recruiter or hiring manager instead. Don't make it an actual ""letter."" Instead, make it the body of the email with your resume attached. When people attach a letter and a résumé to an email, let me just say only one attachment is getting opened, and it's always the résumé. So don't even bother. Keep it short and to the point. Like seriously, five sentences is all that's necessary. If you're in sales or something, maybe a few bullet points. But no multiple paragraphs. Long cover letters are simply not going to get read. Tailor it. Get the name of the company right in the cover letter. When I did campus recruiting for new grads at Expedia, half of the time the candidates got this wrong. They were applying to companies at such volume that it wasn't uncommon to see ""I'm excited about the possibility of an opportunity at Microsoft or Google or some other company that was not the company for which I worked."" Inject some personality into it, please. If your cover letter sounds like that of everyone else, you have completely defeated the purpose. Similar to ""objectives"" on a résumé, cover letters are a bit of a throwback to another era in job-hunting where we didn't have fancy applicant tracking systems that connected a candidate's application with a tangible job or requisition. But for some reason we want to continue this exercise, so we may as well do it with more flair. I would also say cover letter requirements are industry-specific. In tech, one of the more evolved industries, I feel like they're totally unnecessary. That may not be the case in finance or management consulting, or any of the ""bedrock"" industries.","Not only do we not usually read them, most of the time we don't even open that attachment or give cover letters a cursory glance"

2842," FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images Why do we make things so complicated? Take retirement accounts for example. It seems like a simple concept. Enable people to save money tax-deferred during their working years, and then tax the investments when they are withdrawn from the account in retirement. Yet our beloved government has managed to complicate this simple concept. Let's start with the types of retirement accounts. If you think there is just a 401k or IRA, think again. Here's just a partial list: Traditional 401k Roth 401k Self-Directed 401k Safe-Harbor 401k Tiered Profit Sharing 401k Simple 401k (my personal favorite) Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) Roth IRA SEP IRA Inherited IRA Simple IRA And that's just a short list. I haven't even touched 403b plans, 457 plans, or defined benefit plans. The complications go far beyond the type of retirement plans. There's the question of whether traditional IRA contributions are deductible. Should you invest in a Roth or traditional retirement account, or both? Many are asking if they should convert traditional retirement account funds to a Roth account. Part of that question brings up the Backdoor Roth. And forget about calculating your Required Minimum Distribution on your own. In the midst of all this complexity, today let's talk about a very simple rule. I call it the 25x Rule to Early Retirement. Here it is. As a general rule, you need to save 25 times your annual expenses (not salary) to retire. Once you've achieved that milestone, you are financially free. Let's look at an example. If you spend $75,000 a year, you'll need a nest egg of $1,875,000 to retire. You'll notice that I've completely ignored other sources of retirement income, such as social security. If you are retiring early, you won't have access to social security, at least not at first. If you do have other sources of income, however, it's easy enough to make the adjustment. In our example, let's assume our fearless early retiree will receive $25,000 a year from an annuity. In that case, their nest egg need only cover $50,000 a year. Using our 25x rule, that brings down their required savings to $1,250.000. Now let's turn to why this rule works. The financial goal of retirement is to make sure that we die before we run out of money. Financial planners have a more subtle way of stating this stark reality. They call it longevity risk. That's the risk that your money will run out before you do. Putting aside the fancy words, the goal remains the same--making sure we expire before our money does. The theory behind the 25x rule is another rule--the 4% safe withdrawal rate rule-of-thumb. According to the 4% rule, a retiree can withdraw 4% of their investments in the first year of retirement. In subsequent years, they can then increase the amount by the rate of inflation. At this withdrawal rate, the theory goes, the retiree has a reasonable chance of dying before they run out of money. The 4% rule is covered in detail in the Trinity Study. I'm working on another article that explores the Trinity Study in more detail. For our purposes, however, there are three very important things to keep in mind about the 4% rule: 1. It's not a guarantee. Experts have backtested the 4% rule and found that it works most of the time. A very bad market in the first few years of retirement, however, could spell disaster for any retiree. 2. Asset allocation matters. According to William Bergen, the father of the 4% rule, your allocation to stocks should be no less than 50% and closer to 75%. 3. The assumptions do not account for investment fees. Pay an advisor one percent or more a year to manage your investments and you'll need to lower the 4% rule accordingly. It's important here to stress that the 4% rule is more of a guideline than a rule. For those who retire at a very young age, a 4% withdraw rate the first year followed by inflation-adjusted withdraws thereafter may not be appropriate. William Bergen's study linked to above has found that an initial 3.5% withdraw rate would last at least 50 years under most market conditions. While that doesn't seem like a big difference, it is. At 3.5% you'll need to have saved over $2.1 million (instead of $1,875,000) to generate $75,000 a year in retirement income. Here it's important to understand that as the first year withdraw rate goes down, the amount you need to save goes up. One final consideration--taxes. The 25x Rule makes no assumptions about taxes. There are several reasons for this. First, each individual's tax situation is different, depending on a host of factors including income and state of residence. Second, how retirement income is taxed depends on a number of factors, including the type of retirement account (traditional versus Roth). Third, some retirees may draw from taxable accounts, which typically include assets that are subject to tax and some that are not. The key point here is to make sure you factor in taxes based on your specific set of circumstances. It's at this point that you may feel the 25x Rule of Early Retirement isn't so simple after all. It's true that we can't shield ourselves from the complexity of our tax code. It's also true that some thought must be given to our asset allocation and investment fees. It's also true, however, that saving 25 times your annual expenses is a good rule of thumb when it comes to retirement.","the 25x Rule to Early Retirement. Here it is.

Those who have followed Carson’s recent foray into politics know that he’s come awfully far without much of a discernible policy platform and that he’s primarily filled that vacuum with a bunch of truly cuckoo notions. By contrast, his more tethered-to-reality confidants have said things like, ""Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he’s never run a federal agency,"" and ""The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency."" But here’s a real kick in the pants: Six Democrats voted to confirm this guy when the full Senate had its say on the matter.  What was that about? That’s a good question, given the fact that Carson’s experience with matters like urban economic development and affordable housing concerns was, for all intents and purposes, the null set. So what was it about this inexperienced, part-time huckster that convinced these Democrats to pull the trigger on this confirmation and consign residents of affordable housing to the whims of a guy who couldn’t even remember the baseline details of his own policy proposals from one day to the next? Some are maddeningly vague about their decision. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), for instance, offered a statement that began like so: Dr. Carson has a compelling personal story of rising from an impoverished background to become an accomplished surgeon. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development plays an important role in addressing affordable housing, combatting homelessness, and upholding civil rights and non-discrimination laws. I’m just going to pause right there to point out that while Warner has written two sentences of true facts, they don’t actually relate to each other. And yet they are here presented as if something has been logically demonstrated. He might as well have said, ""Ben Carson is an accomplished neurosurgeon. Oranges are a citrus fruit. QED."" Warner continues: He assured me that he is a ""huge fan"" of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and its subsequent amendments, which prohibit discrimination in housing, and will vigorously enforce laws proscribing redlining. Based on these promises, I will vote for Dr. Carson’s nomination and will continue to monitor his, and HUD’s, actions closely to ensure that the principles of non-discrimination that Americans hold dear will be maintained. OK, so Carson is such a big fan of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 that he promises to not bring back one of the most toxic racist practices of the last century. Good to know! Low bar cleared. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) seems to have had a similar experience meeting with Carson ― he made some vague statements that were good enough to earn her vote, along with a promise to keep an eye on things: When I met with Dr. Carson in my office and questioned him during his confirmation hearing, he made clear his intention to recognize the full social and economic scope of impediments to safe, affordable housing. I’m supporting Dr. Carson today because that approach is crucial to spurring housing opportunity for rural and low-income families on tribal lands and in rural communities alike ― and I intend to hold him to his word. Any successful blueprint begins with a solid foundation, and I look forward to laying the trauma-informed groundwork with Dr. Carson so that our nation’s housing solutions are strong enough for communities that have withstood poverty, crime, abuse, and other adverse experiences and are built to last. Carson ""made clear his intention to recognize"" the entire mission of the agency he’s been tapped to run? And that is the ""solid foundation"" on which to create a ""successful blueprint""? Also: The foundation does not come before the blueprint; that is not how buildings work. A handful of the senators who voted to confirm Carson at least did so with some notion that they’d secured specific commitments. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), for example, instructed Carson to support 30-year mortgages and ""support the Interagency Council on Homelessness."" Also, Tester may have secured a commitment from Carson to come meet some buffalo. Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) ― who reminds Carson of Columbo, apparently ― both believe they fully turned Carson on to the task of lead remediation. Donnelly has been working on alleviating a lead crisis in East Chicago, while Brown cited a ""scourge of lead hazards that have impacted Ohio families."" Both senators issued press releases in which they claimed to have ""secured commitments"" from Carson in this regard. Brown’s press release contains this familiar refrain: ""Let me be clear: I will do everything in my power to hold Dr. Carson accountable for making good on his promises."" That might be a tricky task. In Carson’s prepared remarks to the Senate banking committee that presided over his confirmation hearing, he included some text on lead exposure and the ways it can especially harm children. However, as The Washington Post reported, during his actual testimony, Carson deviated from his prepared remarks, lapsing into a testimony that ""more closely resembled his speeches as a candidate for president."" By doing so, though, Carson avoided what might have been a flap. As the Post noted, the material he included in his prepared remarks on lead and its attendant health risks was lifted wholesale from a 2008 report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. I’m not sure what’s worse: not mentioning lead poisoning at all during your confirmation hearing, or being prepared solely through purloined paragraphs. I mean, on some level, at least Carson cared enough to plagiarize some good stuff, right? So, let’s see. That’s five Democrats who all voted to confirm Carson. Who have we forgotten? Well, there’s Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) ― who as a Democratic senator from West Virginia is basically a Republican anyway. Also, Sen. Angus King, an independent senator from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, voted to confirm Carson. King is well-known for being very ideologically incoherent and procedurally illiterate, which are things Maine senators have somehow traditionally managed to sell to Beltway pundits as an endearing trait rather than a disqualifying one. Oh, and we shouldn’t forget that a bunch of other Democrats on the Senate banking committee voted unanimously to to advance Carson’s nomination to the Senate, for whatever reason. This included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who explained her action by saying that Carson ""made good, detailed promises"" that serve as a ""toehold on accountability,"" which Warren committed herself to pursue personally. ""If Dr. Carson doesn’t follow through on his commitments,"" she wrote, ""I will be the very first person he hears from ― loudly and clearly and frequently."" So as you back over the various statements these Democrats made about Carson, some similar themes emerge. They all felt like they had ""productive meetings"" with Carson. They all believe they managed to ""secure commitments"" from Carson during the confirmation process. Finally, they mostly promised to use what resources they had at their disposal to make sure Carson keeps his promises. Obviously, between their legislative concerns and the many hours a day they spend fundraising, it’s pretty clear these senators will have scads of free time to specifically watch over Carson at HUD with eagle eyes and keep track of his doings. Sure, that should work. You know, if there’s one thing Congress has been historically good at, it’s definitely never allowing HUD to become a slush fund of graft and corruption.","They all felt like they had ""productive meetings"" with Carson.

2845,"Under Armour Inc., the maker of athletic clothing and gear, is acquiring the MyFitnessPal and Endomondo applications for a total of about $560 million in a bid to become the world’s biggest tracker of fitness information. The two apps will complement the company’s current software -- MapMyFitness and UA Record -- giving it a total of 120 million users, according to a statement Wednesday. The company also reported better-than-projected results for the fourth quarter. The move is part of Under Armour’s efforts to lock in customers with technology and services -- rather than just shoes and T-shirts. It bought MapMyFitness Inc. for $150 million in 2013, playing catch-up with competitors like Nike Inc., which was a pioneer in activity tracking. ""There is an overall halo effect,"" for the Under Armour brand, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank said in an interview. The applications also generate revenue with premium versions and advertising, he said. Under Armour shares gained 1 percent to $73.57 at the close in New York. The stock increased 41 percent during the past 12 months, outpacing the 16 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Deal Terms Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. MyFitnessPal, based in San Francisco, offers a program that helps monitor fitness goals. Under Armour agreed to pay $475 million for the business, which has more than 80 million registered users. Endomondo is a Copenhagen-based social network with its own mobile app devoted to fitness with 20 million members -- mostly outside the U.S. Under Armour completed its acquisition of that company last month for $85 million. Both apps, along with MapMyFitness, will automatically sync to UA Record, so users can track all their performances and data from one place. Plank said he envisions UA Record, which has a mobile application and was announced last month, as a daily health dashboard. Nike has a similar digital platform under the Nike+ brand. Over the years, it has ranged from mobile applications to watches that track a user’s runs to the Fuelband bracelet. Now Nike looks like it’s shifting away from hardware. After trying to build digital products on its own, Under Armour realized it would be easier to look for acquisitions, Plank said. These deals also helped the company acquire tech talent, he said. Under Armour has no plans to make its own wearable devices because it’s too difficult and costly, Plank said. The company has made three acquisitions in its history and they’ve all been to help it build an online following through digital tools. ""It’s incredibly difficult"" to keep trying to make a ""better mousetrap every six months,"" he said. HTC Partnership Under Armour announced a licensing deal with HTC Corp. last month in which HTC devices will exclusively use UA Record to track activity, Plank said. The first HTC device under this agreement is expected to be a smartwatch, a person familiar with the matter said last month. Plank founded Under Armour as an apparel company in the 1990s, making workout shirts from synthetic materials that soaked up sweat better than cotton. After the idea took off, Under Armour maintained growth by pushing into categories such as shoes and casual wear. The company, now the largest U.S. sporting-goods maker after Nike, also has expanded distribution overseas. Sales Growth That’s helped Under Armour double sales about every three years. The company expects the rate of growth to slow to 22 percent this year as it enters fewer international markets, its lowest rate since 2009. The slowdown is putting more pressure on the company to expand its customer base with products such as the mobile apps. In the fourth quarter, net income rose 37 percent to $87.7 million, or 40 cents a share, from $64.2 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. That topped the 39 cents that analysts had estimated on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 31 percent to $895.2 million, beating the $848.7 million estimated by analysts.",to become the world’s biggest tracker of fitness information

2854,"The Pokémon Go craze is sweeping across America. See how the game works, why everyone's so crazy about it, and all the stories that have come from it, from the game's positive impact on depression victims to armed robberies. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) This is part of an occasional series in which we explain Internet things. We like to call it memesplaining; you might call it meme-ruining. Regardless, if you just chanced upon an image macro, hashtag or GIF you don’t understand, we have the answers — insofar as answers can be had. The meme: Pokémon Go What it is Pokémon Go is a (possibly overrated?) augmented-reality game that launched in the United States late last week. In a nutshell, the game lays a sort of semi-transparent Poké-world over your actual, geographical location, which you can explore by physically walking around while staring zombie-like at your screen. [The first Pokemon game for smartphones is not what I expected] Pokémon Go has some things in common with the Pokémon franchise that captivated kids in the late 1990s: As in those games, the objective is to find and capture mythical creatures called Pokémon, which can be upgraded and squared off against each other. Pokémon Go differs in a few key respects, though. For starters, as of this writing, there’s no actual mission to work on or some big boss to beat — the point of the game is to amble around more or less aimlessly. You can’t trade Pokémon yet, although that’s allegedly coming, and features such as battling and training have been deliberately watered down. Go also has a wildly popular feature that allows you to take screenshots of Pokémon in the ""wild"" — i.e., on your desk, on a child’s head or on your wife’s hospital bed immediately before she gives birth. Those screenshots, which have blown up on Twitter and Reddit at a truly alarming rate, are critical to the appeal of the game. [The non-gamer’s guide to playing Pokemon Go] Pokémon Go has already been downloaded more times than the dating app Tinder, and it is rapidly encroaching on Twitter, which has been around for a full 10 years. Nintendo’s stock soared nearly 25 percent Monday because of the game — its biggest gain in more than 30 years. Where it started The game was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 6 and was rolled out in the United States the day after. It was supposed to become available in more countries from there, but so many people are already playing the game — overloading its servers — that international rollout has been paused indefinitely. Naturally, that is not stopping some determined players in Europe and elsewhere: It is possible to download Pokémon Go, no matter where you are, by changing your phone’s region settings. [Pokémon Go craze sweeps nation: Players find monsters — and worse] Who started it Go was developed by Niantic, a company spun out from Google and known to many as the studio that previously brought you ""Ingress."" That game is conceptually similar to Pokémon Go, in that you have to get out and explore the ""real world"" to play it. Niantic chief executive John Hanke explained his motivation this way in an interview with the New York Times last month: ""Everyone is spending all this time inside, by their computers. No one goes to the local parks. We wanted to do something that was aspirational: Let’s get people outside. ... Part of the joy of the game is going off the beaten path. We’re not about being strapped in a couch in ‘The Matrix.’"" How to play it as if you know what you’re doing There are already a million guides to playing Pokémon Go out there, from Polygon’s tips for the ""ultimate beginner"" to Game Revolution’s ""advanced"" strategies. Regardless of where you fall on that spectrum, though, the best way to not look like an idiot while playing is to ... not look like you’re playing. Seriously. (Others may think differently about this, but I was sort of embarrassed when a smug stranger in the park across from The Washington Post office sidled up to me and said: ""You’re playing Pokémon, aren’t you? EVERYBODY IS."") To avoid such encounters, I suggest a dual strategy: One, find a viable cover for your phone-distracted wandering. (A dog is helpful here, as is any car ride in city traffic when you’re sitting in the passenger seat.) Two, limit yourself to casual, incidental checks in public — of the kind you might usually deploy for your email or Facebook notifications. Added bonus: This will also help you avoid walking into people or suffering other accidents. A smart observation to make at your next nerdy dinner party More than a mobile game, Pokémon Go is sort of a massive-scale trial run for augmented-reality technology: a chance to get consumers used to the idea of interacting in mixed virtual and physical environments. The more people adopt it, the more situations like the one I described above — where it felt awkward to be called out for playing in public — will actually seem normal, even expected. As the co-founder of one augmented-reality company told NPR, ""I think this could be a real driver of early adoption and bringing people into the fold."" And last but not least, further reading:",Pokémon Go is a (possibly overrated?) augmented-reality game that launched in the United States late last week.
2856,"Recently, I simulated the lives of millions of Americans who earn minimum or nearly minimum wage and lived on an $8.15-an-hour salary for 30 days in New York City. My experience was worlds away from the millions of Americans who live with limited income day in and day out — after all, I did have a safety net of savings and my challenge had a 30-day ""timer"" on it — but it gave me a small glimpse of what it's like to make ends meet with limited income in an expensive city. One of the biggest, most surprising takeaways had nothing to do with dollars, cents, or budgets: There is a lot of pressure to spend in social scenarios ... and it's hard to say no. It seems painfully obvious now, but before living on $8.15 an hour — which allowed me $150 of discretionary spending money for the month after meeting living expenses like rent — I simply didn't notice (or chose to ignore) how friends and family can influence your spending habits. Sure, I was aware of how incredibly easy it is to spend money in a city, but what became more and more evident was how much pressure there is to spend. It's not even the money itself that's the problem. It's the social stigma of opting out. As I learned firsthand, it's straight-up awkward to show up at a restaurant or bar and sip on a glass of water while everyone else is ordering beer and appetizers. (That's why I had never just ordered a free glass of water until last month.) It was more awkward explaining why I wasn't participating: ""I can't afford it."" It turns out that I'm not the only one who has felt awkward or embarrassed in this situation. As Veronica Dagher of The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Many people would rather struggle to pay off a large credit-card bill than utter the phrase 'I can't afford it.'"" During the month-long challenge, for the most part, I chose to utter the phrase, ""I can't afford it"" (or I politely declined social gatherings), but not without realizing how easily outside pressures can get you to spend money that you don't have — unintentionally, your friends and family can wreck your budget. Case in point: My best friend's birthday party ate up over half of my $150 monthly budget and left me with a mere $34 of spending money for the remaining 2 1/2 weeks of the 30-day challenge. Looking forward, I'll keep in mind that, one, it is OK to say no to certain social gatherings. Two, it's equally OK to say yes, socialize without spending any money, and focus on the company around you rather than the consumables. That being said, my month taught me it's much easier said than done.",a lot of pressure to spend

In an effort to combat illegal interstate drug trafficking, Denver International Airport has announced that it intends to ban marijuana possession on all airport property beginning in early January, The Denver Post reported. DIA is the first city facility to prohibit marijuana possession. Flying with marijuana, even medical marijuana, is prohibited by the Transportation Security Administration, DIA spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told the newspaper. Although Colorado voters approved recreational pot in 2012, the substance remains prohibited under federal law. Adults in Colorado can possess up to an ounce of marijuana legally, residents can purchase up to 1 ounce of retail marijuana, while tourists can purchase up to a quarter-ounce at a time. And all of that marijuana will have to be consumed or remain in the state. On New Years Day, dispensaries in Colorado will begin to sell recreational marijuana to adults 21-and-over for the first time in U.S. history. As the marijuana laws in Denver and the rest of the state continue to evolve, the Denver city government has launched a website which aims to educate pot consumers on the do's and don'ts of legal weed.

Researchers discovered less grey matter in the brains of men who regularly view pornography compared with those who don’t. Experts say it’s the first evidence for a link between watching sexually explicit material and reductions in brain size – but the new study doesn’t prove that pornography causes changes to the brain. They say an alternative explanation could be that men with a certain type of brain with overly-sensitive reward stimuli – known as the ‘striatum’ - could be more likely to use pornography. Dr Simone Kühn from the Max Planck Institution in Berlin led the study. ""Unfortunately we cannot answer this question based on the results of the present,"" she said. ""It’s not clear, for example, whether watching porn leads to brain changes or whether people born with certain brain types watch more porn"". Dr Kühn and colleagues from Berlin’s Charite University used 64 healthy men between the ages of 21 and 45 years and studied their porn-watching habits. They matched their survey results with scans of the men’s brains and observed both the volume of the brain and the way they reacted to sexually explicit images. The findings, published in the JAMA Psychiatry Journal, have been met with scepticism from some experts who say that watching pornography in moderation was probably not harmful. Dr Gregory Tau from Columbia University said that porn-watching was ""probably not terrible in moderation"". ""It is possible that there are individuals with a certain kind of brain that are more susceptible to these kinds of behaviours,"" he said. ""Or, it’s possible it’s the excessive use (of porn) that’s perpetuating itself to causing brain changes. Or, it could be both.""

""While this is the right move for the company to achieve our long-term objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees,"" company spokesperson Kris Charles said, according to CNYCentral. The Michigan-based company did not specify how many jobs would be lost during its year-long layoff plan, part of an initiative to shift toward a ""highly efficient warehouse model."" Though as many as 1,100 full-time workers could be impacted, given Kellogg’s estimation that an average distribution center employs 30 full-time workers. Kellogg’s stock saw a decline and its brand perception online took a deep negative nosedive last year following the cereal maker’s politically-driven attack on Breitbart News and its 45 million monthly readers.

2882,"Since March, the nation's biggest airports have been in the grips of a line apocalypse. Security lines have metastasized. What were once unusually long waits have become routine. Big airports are threatening to kick out the Transportation Security Administration and turn the security process back over to private contractors. Watch the security line at DIA grow. From 4:30, to 5:00, to 5:45. Now it's almost to baggage claim @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/r9sWcNrK0m — Jason Gruenauer (@JGonTV) May 26, 2016 The lines aren't invariably nightmarish at every airport, all day long. Still, many people, including me, have missed flights because they arrived at the airport at what used to be a reasonable time and found themselves still trapped in line as their flight took off. The immediate reason for the long lines is pretty simple: Americans are flying more than ever, and the TSA hasn't grown quickly enough to keep up. But the current mess is also a direct result of the TSA's last crisis. Last fall, the agency got in trouble for not doing enough to keep weapons and explosives off planes, and stepped up security as a result. The TSA has serious problems with culture and management, including disciplining whistleblowers who called out problems. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place, the victim of a political consensus that insists airport security must be perfectly airtight without ever being even the slightest bit inconvenient. Lines are getting longer partly because more people are flying In one sense, the long lines are good news: They're a sign of economic recovery as more people are flying. The number of Americans flying dropped precipitously as the recession began, and didn't recover to its 2007 level until 2014. But over the past year and a half, many more people have been flying: Nearly 900 million people passed through American airports in 2015, up 5 percent from 2014. The number of people the TSA had to screen, since some of those passengers came from foreign airports, increased by 6 percent. At the same time, airplane tickets have gotten cheaper as oil prices have fallen. The average domestic plane ticket cost $363 last year, down 8 percent from 2014. It was less expensive to fly in 2015 than in any year since 2010. So far this year, both trends have continued. Overall passenger traffic increased 4 percent in January and 6 percent in February compared with 2014, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Some of the biggest airports — Denver, Los Angeles, New York's JFK, and San Francisco — have seen even bigger increases. Fares, too, are continuing to fall. Hopper, an app that tracks airline ticket prices, is predicting the lowest summer airfares since 2009. But more people flying also means more people in security lines. And TSA staffing hasn't kept up. There are 15 percent more people flying than in 2013, and the TSA has 12 percent fewer staff. Congress isn't wholly to blame for the budget cuts. The Department of Homeland Security's own budget request for the 2016 fiscal year proposed cutting 1,666 screeners' jobs, saying that ""risk-based screening practices"" — such as getting people signed up for TSA's PreCheck program, which allows you access to expedited security if you pass a background check and pay $85 — were making checkpoints more efficient. The goal, the department wrote, was to ""continue transitioning to a smaller, more skilled, professional workforce."" The agency now admits that this was a mistake, and is hiring 768 more screeners. Some airports want to solve the problem by hiring contractors to handle security rather than the TSA, though it's not clear if that would make much of a difference. Some airports with privatized security still have passengers reporting long lines, including San Francisco International and Rochester, New York: SFO TSA 5:30 am #ihatethewait (@ San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, CA) https://t.co/oIylCVd6km pic.twitter.com/ND5Bbt9ZuE — Matt Leung (@mattleung) May 25, 2016 Too long to get through security! Over 1 hr at ROC @asktsa 20 of us missed the flight #iHateTheWait https://t.co/iXzRm7jnUg — Erin Briggs, RN (@ErinBWellness) May 8, 2016 Lines weren't longer before because the TSA was sending people to expedited security As airline passenger counts were reaching record-breaking levels in 2014, the TSA also started hurrying people through its expedited security lanes. Since 2011, the TSA has offered PreCheck, which essentially offers pre-9/11 security for a price: Travelers at more than 150 airports keep their shoes and jackets on and their laptops and liquids in their bags, and they get to go through a regular metal detector rather than a body-scanning machine. But initially the program didn't catch on as widely as the TSA hoped. Most Americans aren't frequent fliers, and the program cost $85. By late 2014, fewer than half a million people had signed up for PreCheck, the Wall Street Journal reported. So in order to make sure the PreCheck lines were used, the TSA started routing regular passengers into them. In September 2013, just 10 percent of passengers got expedited screening — because they were over 70 or under 12, or because they were preapproved through PreCheck or Global Entry, a program focused on world travelers that allows them to get through customs more quickly. Then in October 2013, the TSA expanded PreCheck to people who hadn't directly signed up for it, and the number of people getting expedited security immediately tripled. There were a few ways to get PreCheck access without paying for it — you could be selected before arriving at the airport, based on the information you provide when you book your ticket, a program known as Secure Flight. Or you could be routed into the PreCheck lanes at the airport once you were already there, a program known as ""managed inclusion."" The TSA would randomly assign people to either normal or expedited security lines. TSA officers observing travelers' behavior could pull you out of the expedited line, and explosives detection hand swab machines and dogs were supposed to add an additional layer of security. The Government Accountability Office warned in March 2015 that these procedures hadn't been fully tested. Previous reports had suggested that the behavior detection officers aren't all that effective — a conclusion the TSA disagrees with. Still, at the time, the TSA was sending nearly half of all passengers to expedited screening, even though only about 7.2 million were actually qualified for PreCheck based on their background check, security clearance, or other factors: Expediting the security lines sped up security and reduced the need for TSA screeners. But it also meant that security itself was less thorough. And if there's one thing the American people hate more than long security lines, it's the idea that a terrorist might be able to get a knife, gun, or bomb onto an airplane. The TSA is trying to be less bad at its actual job: security Then, starting last summer, a report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general concluded that the TSA was very, very bad at its actual job. Although the report was supposed to be classified, some damning details leaked: 95 percent of attempts to sneak prohibited items through security were successful. The test results ""were disappointing and troubling,"" John Roth, the inspector general, said in congressional testimony in November. ""We found layers of security simply missing."" Randomly choosing passengers for PreCheck took a lot of heat. Congressional hearings featured one whistleblower who said the TSA was ""handing out PreCheck status like Halloween candy."" So in response, the TSA clamped down on security. It was obvious that this would lead to longer security waits, as Jason Edward Harrington, a former TSA employee, wrote for the Guardian in June 2015: The greatest challenge when it comes to such failures stems from the fundamental catch-22 of the TSA’s mission: if agents properly execute their duties, then internal testing results will improve and airplanes might be slightly safer. But meticulous adherence to the TSA’s standard of practice will mean lines that back up to the ticketing counters. Flights will be missed due to the enormous security delays, and the distended passenger lines themselves will become choice terrorist targets. It’s a classic quantity-versus-quality dilemma. In October 2015, the TSA discontinued managed inclusion, the program that sends travelers into PreCheck lines at the airport and monitors them with behavior officers and explosive trace detectors. Starting last fall, the TSA and some reporters warned that lines were going to get longer. Washington, DC's airports noticed the change almost immediately, the Washington Post reported. ""I knew that would dramatically increase the number of people in the standard lanes,"" Peter Neffenger, the administration's head, said at congressional hearings this week. But the TSA had planned its budget assuming the expedited screening was going to continue. Since the uproar began about the long lines, Neffenger said the agency is holding daily calls with the busiest airports and has established a national command center to monitor security wait times. And some travelers still manage to breeze through the lines with no trouble: One week ago: 1+ hour waits @ATLairport but now NO LINE for main security checkpoint pic.twitter.com/OOvPvW2Sux — Steve Gehlbach (@SteveGWSB) May 23, 2016 But as long as Americans insist that airport security be flawless, cheap, and fast, the seesawing between outrage that the TSA is too slow and that the TSA isn't doing enough is likely to continue.

2892,"Everyone should be grateful to receive an inheritance, and no parent wants to leave their offspring with nothing. But just 21 percent of those who plan to bequeath money to their children tell them how much money they'll get. When kids do find out the size of their inheritance after a loved one passes away, it's often less then expected. It can add an unwanted feeling—disappointment—into an already-volatile emotional stew.  More than half of 2,700 adults surveyed for Ameriprise Financial late last year expect to get an inheritance of more than $100,000. Among those who had already received an inheritance, about the same percentage (52 percent) got less than $100,000. The survey focused on Americans between the ages of 25 and 70 with at least $25,000 in assets. Some 83 percent plan to leave money to loved ones. If those heirs have unrealistic expectations, it can lead to family tension later, said Marcy Keckler, vice president for financial advice strategy at Ameriprise.  Half of the boomers surveyed plan to leave at least $500,000 to their kids. Forty-seven percent of Gen Xers and 33 percent of millennials wanted to leave that much as well. While the survey found that the majority of those who had already inherited got less than $100,000, perhaps the portfolios of those benefactors hadn't lived through an eight-year bull market. Family conflicts often arise when money mixes with grief. Almost a quarter of those surveyed expect family members will have disagreements after they learn the terms of the will. That proved true for 25 percent of those in the survey who were left money. For parents, sometimes the issue is whether to leave amounts to children that are fair, or that are equal. That can become an issue if one child is wildly successful, while another struggles financially. There's no way to eliminate these conflicts, but you can minimize them, said Eric Reich, a certified financial planner with Reich Asset Management in Marmora, N.J. His clients create what's called an ""ethical will,"" which is a letter, document, or video that explains to kids why their parents divided assets the way they did. Addressing potential conflicts while everyone is still alive is an even better strategy. Reich asks parents to get feedback from their children on what each one really wants from the estate. Usually ""it's not money, but items of sentimental and/or intrinsic value,"" he said. ""Most often the things that a particular child values most, the parents had no idea they even wanted to inherit."" Jewelry usually causes the most problems, Reich said, especially pieces that have been passed down generations. And siblings can hold grudges for a long time. ""I've actually seen two very close siblings who have not spoken for the past 15 years over a piece of furniture, an antique breakfront cabinet valued at $10,000 in an estate valued at $3 million,"" he said. It may be less anxiety-inducing if parents give children an estimation of what they hope to leave them. ""I recommend parents give children some frame of reference,"" said Keckler. By setting proper expectations, the inheritance will be ""less of a source of tension later,"" she said. Beloved animals may also receive money if an owner dies. Some 5 percent of the people surveyed said they wanted to leave money behind for care of a pet. Whatever the intent, few will match what is perhaps the largest inheritance left to a pet ever: $12 million, from New York hotel heiress Leona Helmsley to her maltese, Trouble. 1 The amount was eventually cut by the court to $2 million. She left her two grandsons out of the will. ","the majority of those who had already inherited got less than $100,000"
2897,"Alexandria’s genesis is an online myth. It claims that a genetic mutation turns some people into ""perfect"" human beings. This is fiction, but several real medical conditions can cause changes in eye color. The myth has been traced back to 2005, though it may have been spread earlier. People with the fake condition are said to be able to live to 150, and they allegedly have: purple eyes, with the color present from birth or developing shortly after, pale skin, perfectly proportioned bodies, an absence of body hair, high levels fertility, but without menstruation in women, excellent immune systems, very little bodily waste While Alexandria’s genesis is a complete fabrication, the following real conditions can change the color of the iris. Conditions that change eye color The iris is the colored ring that surrounds the eye’s pupil. It controls the amount of light that enters the eye. Natural changes with age Most babies are born with brown eyes. However, many of Caucasian heritage initially have blue or gray eyes. This color may darken over time, to become green, hazel, or brown. Infants with brown eyes rarely experience changes in iris color, although the shade of brown may become more prominent. A change in iris color occurs because of a protein called melanin, which is also present in the hair and skin. Cells called melanocytes produce melanin in response to light exposure. Melanocytes become more active during the first year of life, explaining the change in an infant’s eye color. Usually, changes in eye color will have stopped by the age of 6, though some people experience them throughout adolescence and adulthood. Research suggests that this phenomenon affects 10–15 percent of people of Caucasian heritage. Heterochromia iridis People with heterochromia iridis have eyes of different colors. Another form of the condition, called segmental heterochromia, causes color variations within the same iris. Most of the time, heterochromia occurs sporadically and is not caused by another disorder. In rare cases, it may be linked to other conditions, such as: Horner’s syndrome, Parry-Romberg syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome Fuchs’ heterochromic uveitis (FHU) Also known as Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis, this rare condition is characterized by long-term inflammation of the iris and other parts of the eye. FHU causes a change in eye color. The iris usually becomes lighter, though it may darken in some cases. FHU typically affects one eye, but 15 percent of people experience a change in both, according to the American Uveitis Society. Other symptoms include decreased vision and the perception of ""floaters."" FHU may increase a person’s risk of developing other eye conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Horner’s syndrome Horner’s syndrome, or Horner-Bernard syndrome, refers to a group of symptoms that affect one side of the face. These include: decreased pupil size, delayed opening of the pupil in dim light, a drooping eyelid, reduced sweating on one side of the face The difference in pupil size between the affected and unaffected eyes can give the appearance of different eye colors. The iris of the affected eye may also be lighter in color when the syndrome develops in babies under 1 year old. Horner’s syndrome is caused by a disruption in a nerve pathway leading from the brain to one eye and side of the face. It often results from damage induced by: a spinal cord injury, a stroke, a tumor, Sometimes no underlying cause can be found. Pigmentary glaucoma Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions caused by damage to the optic nerve. This damage is often linked to abnormally high pressure in the eye. Glaucoma can lead to vision loss if left untreated. It is estimated that over 3 million Americans have glaucoma, though not all are aware of it. One type, pigmentary glaucoma, causes the pigmentation in the iris to fall away in tiny granules. These granules build up in the eye’s drainage channels, preventing fluid from seeping out and increasing pressure in the eye. This may lead to abnormalities in the iris, though the color of the eyes will not completely change. Treatment involving medication, lasers, or surgery can reduce the buildup of pressure, but it is difficult to prevent the release of pigment. Tumors of the iris Tumors may grow behind or within the iris. The majority are cysts or pigmented lesions similar to moles, called nevi. Other tumors may be cancerous. Tumors in the iris usually cause no symptoms, but some people with nevi may notice changes in their eye color. Even when no other symptoms are present, if a person suspects that they have a tumor they should see a doctor, especially if a nevus: changes shape or color, becomes bigger, interferes with the pupil Treatments include radiation and surgery. Medicated eye drops Some medicated eye drops used to treat glaucoma can lead to changes in eye color. Medications known as prostaglandin analogs, such as latanoprost (Xalatan) and bimatoprost (Lumigan), can cause light-colored eyes to darken. They may also lead to other changes in the eyes’ appearance. Bimatoprost can act as an eyelash enhancer, and it is marketed under the name Latisse for this purpose. When applied to the eyelashes, Latisse can encourage growth, but it may also increase brown pigmentation in the eyes. This effect is likely permanent. Latisse can cause the skin of the eyelids to darken as well, though this effect usually goes away when a person stops using the product. When to see a doctor Anyone who notices changes in the color of one or both eyes should see a doctor. Changes unrelated to color should also be investigated, as they may signal an underlying condition. A person should also seek treatment anytime they experience: reduced vision, blurriness, floating spots in the field of vision, pain, redness of the eyes, Takeaway Alexandria’s genesis is a myth about the existence of ""perfect"" human beings who have purple eyes and other unrealistic attributes. However, many real conditions and some medications can change the iris’ color. Eye color may also change naturally over time, especially in early childhood. These changes may be harmless but should always be checked by a doctor. If there is a serious underlying cause, such as glaucoma or a malignant tumor, early treatment can improve a person’s outlook.","Alexandria’s genesis is a complete fabrication,"

2900,"© Joe Raedle Couple getting married It's one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don’t know us very well. In a wiser, more self-aware society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: ""And how are you crazy?"" Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working; perhaps we’re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody’s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don’t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more self-aware. Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we’ve done our homework. We haven’t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all; it was often expedient, narrow-minded, snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it — the marriage of feeling — has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it’s been only six months since they met; one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens), the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant’s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn’t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity — which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent’s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as grown-ups find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right — too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable — given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don’t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky; otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn’t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn’t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. WE need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us — and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn’t exist), but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently — the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the ""not overly wrong"" person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us; it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not ""normal."" We should learn to accommodate ourselves to ""wrongness,"" striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners.","The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn’t exist), but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently — the person who is good at disagreement.

2901,"It seems like a no brainer but we should probably start this article off with a good ol’, ""You probably shouldn’t try this at home,"" disclaimer. Seriously, don’t. No matter how cool (literally) this experiment is. The aptly named YouTube channel Crazy Russian Hacker is up to his crazy Russian hacking tricks yet again—this time with an experiment apt for the arrival of summer: He combined about 30 pounds of dry ice with a beautiful hillside swimming pool. What we call dry ice is actually the solid form of carbon dioxide and, put simply, is extremely cold. The neat trick that frozen CO2 plays in normal atmospheric pressure is that it has the ability to skip over its liquid state and go from a solid directly into a gas. This process, called sublimation, happens at a very cold −109.3 °F which, among other things, means that dry ice should never be handled with bare hands. You can actually see the Crazy Russian Hacker make this mistake a few times in the video as he reels from even the most brief contact with the dry ice. To speed its sublimation, and to trigger this awesome effect, chunks of the frozen CO2 are dropped into the swimming pool which causes quite the show. Plumes of carbon dioxide gas billow from the surface of the pool as the pieces appear to boil beneath the surface of the water. Some may have seen a similar trick done with liquid nitrogen, which, as you can imagine, is vastly more dangerous. A few years back, an event hosted by Jägermeister caused eight people to suffer injuries and landed one person in a coma after tanks of the much colder substance were poured into a pool. While the reaction isn’t toxic, what likely happened is that the cloud of vapor displaced the breathable oxygen of the pool goers, causing them to pass out. Though everyone recovered, the incident does mark the one and only time that Jägermeister wasn’t the most harmful liquid at a pool party. We should note that although dry ice is more attainable and somewhat safer than liquid nitrogen (not by much, guys—really, don’t do this at home), similar oxygen displacement can occur. So if you’re thinking of making your swimming pool into a witch’s cauldron this summer, you probably shouldn’t swim in it. Over-inhalation of CO2 can result in hypercapnia, which, as we’re sure you can guess, isn’t too much fun. Have you had any run-ins with the dryest ice around? Let’s have a ""cool"" conversation in the comments below!

2903,"The most precise chronology of Early Egypt yet suggests the country formed much more quickly than previously thought. The new finding reveals a robust timeline for the first eight kings and queens of Egypt, including, in order of succession Aha, Djer, Djet, Queen Merneith, Den, Anedjib, Semerkhet and Qa'a. The accession of King Aha to the throne is often thought to define the start of the Egyptian state, with the new study suggesting (with 68 percent probability) that he became king between 3111 B.C. and 3045 B.C. Existing timelines of Egypt's transition from a nomadic community along the Nile River to a permanent state are mainly based on changes in pottery artifacts found at various locations around the country. However, such timelines are flawed due to the subjectivity required to distinguish one pottery style from another, and because styles might vary from site to site without signifying a change in time period. [See Photos of Egypt's Great Terrace of God] To create a more reliable timeline, archaeologists based at the University of Oxford have developed the most comprehensive chronological analyses of Early Egypt artifacts yet based on a computer model of existing and newly measured radiocarbon dates. The analyses suggest the rise to statehood occurred between 200 and 300 years faster than previously thought, beginning between 3800 B.C. and 3700 B.C., rather than the past estimate of 4000 B.C. The findings, which also suggest the preceding Neolithic period lasted longer than thought, are detailed Sept. 4 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A. Monumental tombs of the Royal Cemetery at Abydos, Upper Egypt, where the First Dynasty kings of Egypt are buried. The resulting dates for each ruler were accurate to within 32 years, and with 68 percent probability, the researchers said. The dates revealed King Djer ruled from about 3073 B.C. to 3036 B.C.; King Djet from 2989–2941 B.C.; Queen Merneith from 2946–2916 B.C.; King Den from 2928–2911 B.C.; King Anedjib from 2916–2896 B.C.; King Semerkhet from 2912–2891 B.C.; and King Qa'a from 2906–2886 B.C. ""We got a whole lot more dates, did the model, and got the computer to work out what this means for when things actually happened,"" said Michael Dee, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford and a co-author on the paper. ""Nobody had ever done that before."" The team analyzed organic material from artifacts obtained from museum collections that were not in good enough shape to go on display. The samples included animal remains, shells, plant material and charcoal. ""A lot of the stuff is not is particularly beautiful,"" Dee said. ""It ends up in crates in storage, but a lot of that is gold dust for radiocarbon dating."" To determine the age of the materials, the team measured the amount of radioactive carbon-14 in each sample and used the known decay rate of carbon-14 to calculate an age. Such calculations are not exact and produce results that represent a window of time, usually ranging between 200 to 300 years or so. By placing the dates in a computer model, the team was able to identify distinct periods of overlap in artifacts from the same time period, producing narrower and more precise age windows. Only very small quantities of material were needed for the analyses, ranging from roughly 10 milligrams – about the size of a fingernail clipping – for plant material, to as much as 0.5 grams (0.02 ounces) for bone. Egypt was, by some standards, the world's first country as countries are known today. Other existing settlements at the time were isolated city-states, but Egypt developed into a more complex and expansive settlement similar to modern countries today, Dee said. The team hopes that their results will help inform future research on Early Egypt culture, but does not have plans to produce more dates from Egypt. ""This is not the end of the road at all, but in terms of our work, we have done most of what we can do for now,"" Dee said. Similar types of in-depth chronologies would benefit other regions lacking such precise timelines, including Mesopotamia, said Dee. Copyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

2907,"More than 60 people died and thousands were forced to flee their villages when Hindu-Muslim riots erupted in two districts of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 2013. The violence, sparked by the alleged harassment of a young Hindu woman by a Muslim man, lasted two days. A few days later, seven women, all Muslims, went to the police alleging that they were gang-raped during the violence that broke out in their villages. The police took a year to arrest all the 29 accused, who were later released on bail. The trials were supposed to be completed in special fast track courts within two months. But nearly four years on, the women are still waiting for justice. Amnesty International's Mariya Salim has worked on a report tracing the legal journey of the women and says there is a clear lack of will on the part of the administration to ensure they get justice. ""Research tells us that there have been only three convictions in rape cases during Hindu-Muslim communal riots since the country's partition, and that hasn't changed even now. We have seen delays at every stage"", Ms Salim says. The BBC's Divya Arya travelled to the area to listen to the women's stories. Rubina ""No video recording and no photos on the internet,"" was how Rubina greeted me when I visited her new home, 30km from the village where she lived before the riots. In the aftermath, many Muslims were forced to leave and settle elsewhere. The Muzaffarnagar-Shamli districts are now dotted with ghettos, where those displaced by the riots have bought land and constructed houses after the Supreme Court directed the state government to pay them compensation. Rubina is a middle-aged woman. She stood before me with a baby resting on her elbow and shoulders and two young children tugging at her tunic. ""I am tired of having my grandchildren complain to my daughter that they are humiliated at school because some child saw their 'rape victim' grandmother's photo,"" she told me later. Rubina said she was gang raped by four men, including her neighbours. ""I fell unconscious, and when I came to, I just ran, with everyone else in the village."" They had no time to pack or take any money with them. Together they lived in relief camps for months on end. Shared trauma and difficult circumstances bred strength and sisterhood. But then there were the threats. ""The accused threatened to kill my children, so I once retracted my statement, but after my husband and lawyer reassured me I testified before the judge with the complete truth."" Charges have still not been framed in her case, despite her giving testimony, undergoing medical tests and attending endless rounds of court hearings. Rubina said she didn't see the point of continuing. Struggling to make ends meet, she feels uprooted and lost. ""All I've got is the tag of fallen woman, I'm exhausted. Why should I pursue the case?"" Nafeesa Just like the other alleged rape survivors, Nafeesa cannot read or write. ""I had only ever heard of the Delhi gang rape incident before my own rape, so I thought the accused would get punished as soon as I identified them in my complaint,"" she said. ""Little did I know these cases can take so long."" Nafeesa grew quiet as if remembering that night all over again, where she says she was raped by five men, all known to her. She alleged they threatened to kill her two-year-old son to stop her screaming. Nafeesa now lives in a colony of the riot-displaced only 2km from her village. ""We would never go back there, there is nothing left for us, and they (Hindus) would dare not come here. We are safe here among people of our own religion,"" she said. But it's a tough life. Many of these colonies have no electricity connections, drainage or roads. Then she said: ""Sometimes I wonder why I filed this case. I haven't got any justice, and the threat to my life still remains."" ""They [the accused men] live in their villages and roam free, they lost nothing; we lost everything."" Khalida Her voice stood out clear, crisp and fresh. If there were any signs of fatigue with the long legal battle, she hid them well. ""I won't leave them unpunished"", she said over the phone. ""I haven't lost courage and I haven't forgotten anything, they will have to pay for my countless sleepless nights."" Khalida is exceptionally brave. She has left Uttar Pradesh, where she alleges she was attacked by three men during the riots. They found her in fields where she had fled. She is now in hiding with her children, but I was able to speak to her after meeting her husband. He told me that the threats to their family are still grave and the pace of the trial very slow, so Khalida's lawyer has petitioned that her case be heard outside Uttar Pradesh. But that petition was filed a year ago and is still waiting to be heard. Just like the other women who have come forward, their livelihoods have also been disrupted by riots and fighting the rape case is as much a legal matter as it is a financial one. But Khalida's husband told me he'd go to any length to support his wife's quest for justice. As I began to hang up the phone, Khalida said: ""He is very fond of me... I'll continue to fight with his strength.""

2917,"This touching story gives a whole new meaning to ""’till death do us part."" After 63 years of loving marriage, Henry and Jeanette De Lange passed away just minutes after each other at ages 86 and 87, respectively. Jeanette had been battling Alzheimer’s for several years and was admitted to a local nursing home in 2011. Her elderly husband, who struggled with prostate cancer for months years before his death, visited her often multiple times a day in the nursing home. But it wasn’t until July 31st, 2016 that the De Lange family was told their parents’ health was declining rapidly and that they should get to the hospital as soon as possible. About 7-8 weeks before, the VA told Korean War vet Henry that there was nothing more they could do to treat the rapidly growing prostate cancer. At that point, Henry requested to be put in the local nursing home. Thanks to the kindness of the staff, Henry and Jeanette were placed in the same room and happily reunited. The De Lange family told KSFY news that their parents’ last weeks were significantly sweeter because they were able to be together day in and day out. On the July afternoon their parents would pass, two of the five De Lange kids were present. Originally the nurses said it was their father who would go first. ""[The doctor] said your dad’s pulse is worse. I wonder if he’ll go first,"" Lee explained to KSFY. ""About five minutes later, the aid said I think your mom will go very soon. It was 5:05 p.m. at that point."" As she was passing, the two brothers present read aloud a favorite Psalm, Psalm 103, which they didn’t even finish before their mother peacefully passed. Son Keith went up to their resting father and told him that his wife had ""gone to heaven"" and that if he wanted to stop fighting and go with her, it was okay. ""It’s one of those things you don’t pray for, because that just seems mean,"" Lee said. ""But you couldn’t ask for anything more beautiful."" Both sons reported that their dad opened his eyes for the first time in hours, looked intently over at his loving wife, and laid back down. 20 minutes later, Henry De Lange passed away, just minutes after Jeanette. About 25 minutes later, Lee happened to turn around and look at the clock on the nursing home wall – it said 5:30. Thinking that was strange, Lee checked his watch; it was actually five to six. The clock had frozen at the exact time his father had passed away, 25 minutes previously. This is something that the De Lange family just has not been able to explain – and, truly, it is an extraordinary ending to an already tear-jerking story. The De Lange’s firmly believe that this bizarre circumstance was a sign from God, letting the grieving children know that this was the right time for their beloved parents to both pass. What an amazing story. This is an inspiring testament to the power of true love. What do you think about this beautifully sad story?

2923,"Back when Man of Steel came out, some fans insisted that they saw Christopher Reeve briefly ""appear"" in a key scene late in the film. Now, the film's director Zack Snyder has definitively said that's not the case. A video posted to the Cines Argentinos YouTube page shows Snyder being interviewed, and asked about the scene -- which purportedly takes place during Superman's attack on the World Engine over the Indian Ocean. ""Fan theory. It doesn't exist; it's just looks like that,"" Snyder said, then added, ""If it looks like that, that's the gods, not me."" When Superman is about to destroy the World Engine, in a scene that's a pretty clear homage to the old Fleischer cartoons, there's what appears to be a distortion to his face. Many fans thought Cavill's face was briefly, digitally replaced by Reeve's in an homage to the actor who defined Superman for a generation of moviegoers. Our inclination was to say that wasn't the case, but there's no solid evidence one way or another. Watching closely and in high-def, it seems as though Cavill's face just looks more like Reeve's when he's in that sequence, with special effects and probably high-powered fans blowing on his face. What seemed in the theater like a half-second is actually a longer period of time during which there's not one particular shot where he looks more like Reeve than others to us, so it seems unlikely to have been digital manipulation. We had previously checked with the video commentary track that runs alongside the movie on the Bonus Disc included with the Blu-ray, out tomorrow. And the commentary was silent on the matter. Snyder had declined previous opportunities to comment on it when asked up to that point, so it seemed as though he wasn't interested in giving a definitive answer -- which of course convinced fans that they were right and the filmmaker was being coy.","Our inclination was to say that wasn't the case, but there's no solid evidence one way or another."
2925,"With all of the feature profiles and magazine cover stories on Stephen Colbert and his new job as the host of The Late Show , you’d be forgiven for thinking the late-night host is not only raising his public profile but his salary as well. You’d be wrong. While the exact details of Colbert’s contract haven’t been disclosed, if the reported $4.6 million per year for a three-year deal with CBS is accurate, that would actually be a decrease from the 51-year-old entertainer's reported $6 million salary at the end of his tenure on Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report . That puts Colbert on the low end of the late-night salary spectrum: Jimmy Fallon takes home a reported $11 to $12 million as host of NBC’s The Tonight Show ; Jimmy Kimmel earns $10 million for Jimmy Kimmel Live! ; and Conan O'Brien enjoyed a $12 million salary last year as host of Conan on TBS. Then there are the retired titans: before turning over their shows, David Letterman made $30 million some years as host of The Late Show, while Jay Leno took home $20 to $25 million a year on The Tonight Show. And of course, nothing comes close to the $25 million Johnny Carson earned in 1980—the equivalent of roughly $72 million today when adjusted for inflation. While the move to CBS will certainly elevate the late-night talker in the public consciousness, Colbert will first have to prove he can make the network money before before he starts raking in bigger bucks. (Just ask O’Brien, who worked on 13-week contracts when he started as host of NBC’s Late Night.) Colbert’s spot in the lineup is crucial for CBS. With ad buyers coveting a younger demographic, there’s increased pressure on all late-night hosts to create TV that not only attracts live views but also produces hits the next day on social media platforms, Fallon’s celebrity lip-syncing segments and John Oliver’s breakdown of cultural issues on Last Week Tonight being prime examples. On Comedy Central, Colbert could be counted on to deliver funny, engaging segments with a political punch that appealed to college grads constantly refreshing their Twitter feeds; on CBS, it’s unclear how that will play out (though Colbert will surely have some fun with the 2016 election). What is clear is that CBS is relying on Colbert to fill the ad dollar void left by Letterman. Ad spending on broadcast network late-night talk shows was $597.5 million in 2014, according to Kantar Media, up 14% from 2013. And as Variety noted, ""late-night ad prices this year rose by a greater percentage than those for primetime TV."" While all late-night shows have seen declines in viewership, CBS is wise to put its chips on Colbert. A December 2014 episode of The Colbert Report had 3.6 million online streams, according to Comedy Central; that’s three times his average live TV viewership in 2014. And whereas the viewers of Letterman's show averaged 58.2 years old, The Colbert Report 's average viewer was 42.3 years old—""the youngest-skewing audience of any late-night broadcast or cable show,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter . In fact, CBS has already seen renewed interest, with a spokesman telling AdAge that ad rates "" increased significantly "" for late-night shows on the network at this year’s TV upfronts. If Colbert can keep that momentum going, he’s sure to enjoy a sizable raise down the road . But hey, if none of that works out, perhaps Colbert’s cut from Jeb Bush’s raffle will bring in some extra cash.",Colbert will first have to prove he can make the network money before before he starts raking in bigger bucks

""That was the only scene he was scared of on paper because he is known for a certain body type. His picture can be found in almost every gym in India.

In a conversation with Bon Appetit , Bourdain claimed that he never eats the food on the many, many plane rides he takes as he travels the world. ""Never,"" said Bourdain.

2944,"The figures represent a 150 per cent increase on 2014 figures and a 15 per cent increase on 2015 More than a quarter of a million patients were forced to change their doctor’s surgery last year as the closure of GP practices hit record levels, data suggests. Some 265,000 patients had to change their practice, a 150 per cent increase on 2014 figures and a 15 per cent increase on 2015, according to data collected by Pulse magazine under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures, most of which were provided by NHS England, showed that 57 practices closed completely last year. A further 34 closed due to the merger of practices. Some areas were particularly hit, with Brighton seeing seven practices close in the past two years, Pulse said. Four of these closures meant 9,000 patients had to find a new surgery. Last year, NHS England announced a £500m ""turnaround package"" to help struggling surgeries, including those at risk of closure. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""GP practices are the lifeblood of our local communities so the complete closure of any practice will always be a last resort when all other options have proved unworkable. ""Unfortunately, too many practices are being forced to close because GPs and their teams can no longer cope with ever-growing patient demand without the necessary funding and workforce to deal with it."" She said some practices choose to merge ""in order to pool their resources to provide additional services or better appointment access, which is in the best interests of patients"". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, told Pulse: ""We know the money, targeted in the right way, for the most severely affected practices, can make a difference. ""The tragedy is CCGs [Clinical Commissioning Groups] have not delivered their part in making the resource available. Many practices that should have received support have had none to date. That’s been a failing of local delivery."" An NHS England spokesman said: ""All NHS patients wanting to register with a GP practice are guaranteed to be able to do so and we have increased investment in general practice by £1bn in two years in order to improve services and boost GP numbers. The spokesman said the figures ""as presented"" did not reflected the full picture as they included patients whose records automatically transferred after a merger. He said: ""As part of our plans to improve general practice services and boost the workforce, many practices are choosing to merge in order to offer patients a much greater range of services."" Shadow Health Secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, commented: ""Given the crisis in hospitals we’ve seen, we need to be taking pressure off of hospitals. ""That means doing much more to protect GP services. With Labour, general practice will be at the heart of making the English NHS more focused on care closer to home.

2946,"Every so often, a bleary-eyed friend tells me they've quit coffee. My response to this is always the same: Why? Because my long-held hunch -- based on many years of following this stuff as a health and science writer -- has been that coffee is probably not bad for you, and may even be quite good for you, a theory now backed by a recent video post from Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Carroll combs through an impressive amount of high-quality data and finds almost no evidence that even the more enthusiastic coffee drinkers among us -- those who down five or six or even seven cups a day -- are risking their health for their favored vice. Coffee consumption, in fact, probably shouldn't even be considered a vice, says Carroll, though he notes that it's the stuff we put in our coffee -- sugar and flavored syrup and the like -- that turns it into liquid candy. ""It's way past time that we stopped viewing coffee itself as something we need to cut back on,"" he concludes.

2951,"The structure is 1,400 feet long and suspended 1,000 feet above ground level THE world's highest and longest bridge has been forced close after it was ""overwhelmed by the volume of visitors"". The glass-bottomed structure, which is 1,400 feet long and suspended 1,000 feet above ground level officially opened to visitors in China just 13 days ago. Tourists take in the view from the glass bottomed bridge The bridge offers stunning views of the canyon The official line was that the government was planning urgent maintenance work in the area and the bridge closed on Friday, with a re-opening time to be announced. But a spokesman is said to have told CNN the was ""overwhelmed by the volume of visitors"". He stressed there had been no accidents and the bridge was not cracked or broken. The glass bridge, designed by Israeli architect Haim Dotan, can accommodate 8,000 visitors a day. But it is thought 10 times as many people wanted access daily. Officials at the park announced the closure in a social media post and said the government urgently needed to upgrade the area. The post said that tour groups who had planned to see the bridge - which will allow people to bungee jump or ride a zip line - might have ""discretionary admission"". In response to the announcement, one social media user wrote: ""I have booked everything and now you are saying you are closed... Are you kidding me?"" Chinese officials say the bridge is the tallest and highest glass bottomed bridge The bridge officially opened to visitors on Saturday Tourists can look down through the glass bridge to the canyon below - if you dare To celebrate its opening, officials organised a number of special events, including one where people were encouraged to try and SMASH the bridge's glass panels with a sledge hammer to demonstrate its safety. Another event saw a car being towed along it to test the strength of the 99 panels of clear glass. ""I wanted to feel awe-inspired by this bridge. But I'm not afraid -- it seems safe!"" said Wang Min, who was visiting the new structure with her husband and children. The bridge connects two mountain cliffs in Zhangjiajie park in China's central Hunan province. Officials already say the bridge has already set world records for its architecture and construction.

2954,"On Friday, ""Meet the Press"" host David Gregory sent out this tweet: Plus - only on #MTP: Debating Climate change w/ Bill Nye @TheScienceGuy and Vice Chair of Energy & Commerce Cmte @MarshaBlackburn — David Gregory (@davidgregory) February 14, 2014 This, to put it mildly, is not the way to do things. First, some context: TV news shows almost never cover climate change, which ought to be one of the most aggressively-reported issues around, given that, y'know, it's a dire threat to the planet and everyone on it. A recent study from Media Matters found that the Sunday shows on NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox spent a combined 27 minutes on the topic in the whole of 2013. Meet the Press was singled out as ""failing to offer a single substantial mention of climate change"" for the entire year. So, when ""MTP"" does finally decide that the issue merits its consideration, what does it do? It sets up a ""debate"" about the issue between Bill Nye—who, despite the great things he has done to popularize science, is not a climate scientist—and Blackburn, who has previously tweeted about how proud she is to deny that global warming exists. The existence of climate change is no longer an issue up for discussion, and hasn't been for decades. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said there was a 95 percent chance that humans are responsible for global warming. The only debate left is what to do about climate change, not whether it exists. And, if the Sunday shows do insist on carrying out that tired conflict, they should at least put the debate in the hands of climate scientists, rather than media figures or politicians. ""Meet the Press"" is providing a perfect example of what not to do. The Sunday shows on ABC and CBS are doing marginally better this weekend. Both are covering ""extreme weather,"" which naturally involves a conversation about climate change, and, regrettably, both are seemingly keen on maintaining the idea that there is still a ""debate"" about the topic afoot. Consequently, both shows are featuring Republican governor Pat McCrory, who has previously said that global warming is ""in God's hands."" But they're also turning to actual climate scientists. ""This Week"" is speaking to Climate Central's chief climatologist Dr. Heidi Cullen, and ""Face the Nation"" is turning to Dr. Marshall Shepherd, the former head of the American Meteorological Society. That's a small step, but it is something.","Meet the Press was singled out as ""failing to offer a single substantial mention of climate change"" for the entire year"

2956,"From using a burner phone which can’t be traced to keeping her job a secret from friends and relatives, Girl On The Net explains the struggles of constantly maintaining anonymity On the face of it, there do not appear to be many parallels between being a sex blogger and a secret service agent. However, there is one key similarity: maintaining anonymity at all times and thus leading a double life. For Girl On The Net, remaining anonymous is a constant source of consternation, angst and exhaustion. From using a burner phone which can’t be traced, to fastidiously wiping the internal location data for every photo she uploads, to keeping her job a secret from friends and relatives, there is the always omnipresent, never shakeable fear that someone is going to come along and uncover her identity. The 24 hour task of maintaining anonymity has had a knock-on effect on GOTN's mental health. After her panic attacks became daily occurrences and her anxiety became unmanageable, the stress eventually culminated in a breakdown. Set up in 2011, GOTN is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, sex blog in the UK. Based on her real life experiences, the site covers everything from funny anecdotes to her own personal sexual idiosyncrasies to polemics against the government’s sex education policy. It is an antidote to the woman’s rag brand of sex advice and there are no listicles titled ""The ten best ways to please your man in the bedroom"". But how did the 30-year-old writer fall into sex blogging in the first place? While other demure students were leaving university to be herded into run-of-the-mill, distinctly un-sensual KPMG grad schemes, she decided to try her hand at online erotica. At the time, sex-blogging was in its infancy. ""They say write about what you love and I love sex,"" she tells The Independent over the phone as she is not keen to meet up in person. ""At university, me and my boyfriend floated the idea of writing a blog together. We did a couple of test posts but never put them online because he was a little bit nervous."" However after the relationship ended, she plucked up the courage to start posting the blogs online, only hampered by the condition of keeping him and his sexual preferences anonymous. Since then, anonymity has been an issue GOTN has faced on a daily basis. After all, the fear of being exposed is a real one: household name sex blogger Belle De Jour was forced to reveal her true identity back in 2009 after a tabloid discovered her real name and address. This poses the question of why she decided to be anonymous in the first place. Her answer is unsurprising. ""It’s partly because some of the messages I get from people are scary and also partly because I have elderly grandparents who probably would not want to hear that exact detail of how I like being shagged"". The messages range from ""super fan guys"" declaring that they want to have sex with her to graphic photos with no written messages at all. But another key reason GOTN chose to remain anonymous was the fact she had a day job which was very strict with their social media policy. ""If you were caught doing anything that would bring the company into disrepute then they could fire you."" Since then the task of maintaining anonymity has remained a daily grind. ""It is hard,"" she admits. ""If you look at the main problems with anonymity, the number one is data. These days with pretty much everything you do, all the data is going to be linked - if you use an email address for Facebook - it’s going to then link you with other people who have emailed you at that address."" In turn she is forced to ensure she keeps everything separate, always using a different phone and laptop for GOTN and her personal affairs. She jokes that at times it can almost feel like being a drug dealer and even calls her GOTN phone her ""burner phone"". But her precautions have not always been full proof. She has had a couple of people mine the data from her blog photos to decipher the geographical location it was taken. Fortunately she has always been in hotels rather than at home at the time of the photos being taken. On a more personal level, she says there is the issue of keeping the blog and her job a secret from friends and relatives and perpetually taking measures to ensure she has not revealed the identity of her boyfriend or past sexual partners.  As such, she says running the blog can feel like living a literal double life. ""It’s exhausting because it involves having to constantly think about it"".  It was while juggling her job and the blog that things finally came to a head and culminated in a mental breakdown. Unable to talk about what she did outside of work because it was running the blog, she found herself isolated. She wound up taking a couple of weeks off sick and eventually handing in her notice.  ""I used to tell myself, as I grew more and more anxious, that it was just normal to be constantly on edge,"" she says. ""When I'd have a panic attack, I just assumed that's what busy people like me did. I juggled lots of stuff, always felt like I was about to die, and had to keep running to the bathroom to go and vomit when I got too stressed. But that was normal - that's what I thought.""  However when it got to the point not a day went by without a panic attack, she knew things had gone too far. ""At times I was wanting to die just so I could have a rest. I started struggling to get out of bed and finding I had to dare myself to do the simplest things. Then, one day, I went to a doctor. And it wasn't until I broke down in the doctor's office and she told me ‘you're ill’ that I finally realised this wasn't actually normal."" She was put on anti-depressants but not warned about their sexual side effects. ""My doctor didn’t warn me the pills might make it harder to orgasm,"" she recalled sounding audibly angered. ""I’m a sex blogger that’s my raison d’etre"". While she says it is impossible to ever truly know what caused her breakdown and it was a range of complex interlocking factors, she says the constant pressure to maintain anonymity certainly has not helped. As for her anxiety now, while it is by no means cured and continues to fluctuate, she is better than she was. Nevertheless the fears around anonymity linger on. She might agree to meet a PR on a good day but have a change of heart when the day arrives. ""I’ll be due to meet them but I’ll have a huge panic and say this is awful, what if they take a photo of me?"" she explains. ""It always will be a struggle and I do just have times where it all gets too much. Twitter gets too much or the comments get too much and I have to switch off for a day or two and try and relax."" Another massive burden is keeping the blog a secret from people close to her. While most of her closest friends know what she does, they don’t necessarily know much else and won’t know her actual blog name. ""I try and give people as little information as possible because it puts them in an awkward position as they might have to lie for me,"" she says. Some of GOTN’s closest calls to being exposed have come from friends inadvertently spilling the beans after drinking too much. And then there’s the added dilemma of her parents. While her dad knows her vocation, he does not know her blog name. Her mum knows both but under one important condition that she reads none of it and GOTN’s two published books remain unopened. ""She doesn’t want to read the detail of me getting shagged but she does want to do that proud mum thing of ‘oooh my daughter wrote a book’"". Running the blog has not just given her mum something to be proud about, it has also given herself a tremendous sense of satisfaction. The hugely popular site (it’s the first thing which comes up when you type sex blog into Google) has been profoundly influenced by her feminism. In fact, GOTN sees sex writing as ""fun propaganda"" to draw people in who might never have stumbled across feminist ideas. ""Some people will come to my blog for the feminism and politics and will stay for the porn, others will enter the blog via some really filthy post and will click on ‘Is it feminist to give blowjobs’ which goes into a big detailed discussion on the impact of feminism and sex."" While 40 per cent of the site’s visitors are men, 60 per cent are women. This is perhaps surprising given it is often assumed only women are into what she describes as ""word porn"". As you would imagine GOTN is wary of much mainstream sex advice. But one particular article stands out for her. ""It was called something like the 27 things women wish men would stop doing in bed,"" she says. ""One of the things was: ‘We hate it when they try and stick in our arse we’ve said no’. That is not a comedy line that is rape."" She is also wary of the natural, unthinking parallels which society often draws between sex and love and the assumption that they are one of the same. ""Obviously sex can often be enhanced by being in love but so can cooking someone a delicious meal,"" she reflects. ""There is something really special about cooking for someone you’re in love with and that is a more pleasurable experience than cooking dinner for your mate Clive that you don’t even like that much."" It is her forthright unapologetic explanation of complex thorny issues such as this which makes GOTN so enduringly popular. She provides an honest space for to people to attempt to better understand their love life, sexual desires, mental health and everything in between.","After her panic attacks became daily occurrences and her anxiety became unmanageable, the stress eventually culminated in a breakdown"
2961,"22 days ago 1.0K Shares In his last octagon outing, Conor McGregor suffered his first UFC lost after succumbing to the American's superior grappling. Following his stunning 13-second victory over Jose Aldo he was set to make history by becoming only the third fighter to win belts in two divisions until lightweight holder Rafael Dos Anjos pulled out, paving the way for a catchweight bout with Nate Diaz. What was behind the devastating loss: Cardio? Energy inefficient? Muscle Mass? None of the above, according to coach John Kavanagh. From his new autobiography Win or Learn via The 42, he identified how the practice of weight cutting, which wasn't involved for his UFC 196 fight, played a huge part in his preparation, saying; ""Not having to cut weight for the fight against Diaz was supposedly helpful, but in hindsight it was undoubtedly a hindrance. Cutting weight may not be much fun, but it does serve as a reminder that you're preparing for a fight. It focuses the mind and has been an enormous part of what we've been doing.

""The routine we had established was suddenly absent. The need to cut weight gets the fighter in the zone and lets them know that a fight is on the horizon. If a person is starving, they're in survival mode. It focuses the mind and taps into the reptilian part of the brain. When Conor is cutting weight, he views his opponent as an obstacle in the way of his next meal. It's a primal thing. On the other hand, when you've eaten a good dinner, all you want to do is relax in front of the TV. The fire in your belly is replaced by food. Being stuffed isn't conducive to maintaining a competitive mindset"". #Las_Vegas Side-by-side pic: Conor McGregor 'before' and 'after' going up to 170 ... https://t.co/Qdjlmla4Gy pic.twitter.com/psd7XmbTUk - News Now Las Vegas (@NewsNowLasVegas) March 19, 2016 Despite the bout continuing to take place at welterweight (!!), Team McGregor won't be making the same mistake despite having the luxury of competing two classes above his normal division, adding; ""No cheesecakes this time!

It’s goods news for those who wanna catch em’ all and it’s a move that seems to make a whole lotta sense, considering that unless you head out on some massive trips across the country, you’ll just keep seeing some rather predictable Pokemon spawns. But if this is changed every few weeks or so, it will give us gamers a decent reason to keep us engaged and give us the hope that we will catch some more elusive beasts. Twitter However, before you get mega excited, there is a chance your area might not have seen any change whatsoever. Early indications suggest that some have been left alone during this seismic shift and are not flipping to a new Pokemon just now. And if you thought this could be the end of the common as muck Pokemon, your Pidgeys, Spearows, Rattatas, Zubats etc, then you would be mistaken, as this change appears to only be effecting rare Pokemon. Still though, hopefully this news might just be enough to get you out exploring again- I know I will be.",completely shaken up the entire spawn system
2967,"Someone call Lloyd. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the reason behind the ""Entourage"" movie delay is that star Jeremy Piven has a deal that will pay him more than the four other cast members. Not that fellow ""Entourage"" stars Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Jerry Ferrara and Kevin Dillon should be too surprised with that development: As THR notes, Piven was paid more than the core four since the show's 2004 premiere. Whether all parties can reach an agreement is unclear, but Connolly, at least, expects things to work out. Speaking to TMZ on Sunday, Connolly said the film was going to happen, and while nothing was official just yet, it looked likely to star production in January. That jibes with the THR report, which claims that Warner Bros. is pushing to start the ""Entourage"" movie by January to take advantage of a California tax credit that will help offset some of the film's $30 million budget. It has been an eventful three months in the land of ""Entourage."" In August, director Doug Ellin discussed the difficulty of making ""Entourage"" with Connolly via Twitter: ""@mrkevinconnolly: Hey Twitter is dying to know. Are we doing the Entourage movie or not?""trying to get everyone on board.

2968,"Name: 29 February. Age: Four times younger than every other date. Appearance: Hands down the worst day of the year. The worst day? But it’s magical. No, it isn’t. 29 February is a dirty, capitalist day, geared purely towards the needs of the 1%. But it’s the date when women get to propose to men. Oh, big whoop. Listen, women can do what they want when they want. But, hey, well done for reinforcing the patriarchy, 29 February. Great job. What if you’re born on 29 February? Doesn’t that make you special? Only special in the sense that Facebook always messes up your birthday. It has no way of telling whether you celebrate your non-leap-year birthdays on 28 February or 1 March, which means it often gets it wrong. Can we go back a bit? Why is 29 February capitalist? Let me ask you a question. Are you on a salary? Yes. And that salary is based on the assumption that you work full-time over a 365-day year? That’s right. Well, there are 366 days this year. Today, you’re basically working for free. What? That’s an outrage! I know! We should all down tools, right this minute. If our greedy corporate overlords valued us in the slightest, they’d give us an extra day’s pay. Right now. In an envelope. Actually, they should give me two envelopes, because I’m writing both sides of this conversation. It gets worse. Banks don’t usually count 29 February when they work out customer interest. Today, the banks keep back your hard-earned money as profit. That’s disgusting. Something should be done. It’s terrible. Roll on the year 2100, I say. Why? Isn’t that a leap year, too? No, because years divisible by 100 aren’t leap years. February 2100 will only have 28 days. But 2000 was a year divisible by 100, and that was a leap year. Yes, but only because 2000 is also divisible by 400, which negates the previous ""divisible by 100"" rule. I’m so confused. See? This is exactly what the corporations want. To rule by obfuscation. They’re bleeding us dry. We’re all doomed. Do say: ""Occupy 29 February!"" Don’t say: ""Actually, I’m freelance, so none of this means anything to me.""","Let me ask you a question.

2969,"Photo: Bettmann/Sara D. Davis/Stringer According to ABC’s Jonathan Karl, GOP pooh-bahs are so alarmed by Donald Trump’s post-convention behavior and the chaotic atmosphere inside his campaign that they are looking into what would happen if the wiggy dude actually withdrew from the presidential contest. For the record, I think such speculation is almost certainly the product of wish projection by the many Republican elected officials who devoutly desire that Trump would just go away and let them reclaim ""their"" party in the name of conservative ideology or old-school Chamber of Commerce values or whatever. We’ve heard about his demise too many times to overreact to every report that his candidacy is dead or dying, particularly after a mere four or five days of disastrous missteps. But just for grins, let’s take a quick look at what would happen if Trump announced he was canceling his presidential campaign like it was a summer TV show gone bad. At the national level, the rules (it’s actually in RNC rule No. 9) are reasonably clear: If a presidential nominee dies or withdraws, the RNC is empowered to replace her or him via one of two methods: (1) a vote by the RNC itself in which each state would cast the same number of votes as it possessed at the recent national convention, or (2) an actual reconvening of said convention. There would obviously be significant pressure on the RNC from the abandoned Trump supporters to follow the latter route so they could nominate Jeff Sessions or Gary Busey or whomever. But it would be a logistical and political nightmare. Besides, why should the RNC defer to the same delegates who made such a poor choice the first time around? It’s unclear to whom the RNC would turn if it did itself name a replacement candidate; the obvious choice would be Paul Ryan, if he were willing to accept the poisoned chalice. Another approach would be to elevate Mike Pence, a transitive if very recently minted Trumpite who at least was approved by the convention for the national ticket. Sure, that would make a guy who was probably heading for a loss in a gubernatorial contest in a red state the party’s national leader, and would also produce another vacancy on the ticket that the RNC would have to fill. But a party abandoned by its own nominee would be beggars, not choosers. The one thing that’s clear is that the nominee would have to be approved by a majority vote, which would probably rule out someone like Ted Cruz. The iffier proposition is ensuring that the new ticket is substituted for the old one on 50 state ballots. The only recent precedent was the incident in 1972 when Democratic vice-presidential nominee Senator Tom Eagleton resigned from the ticket on July 31 after revelations that he had a bunch of drunk-driving citations (or, as Hunter Thompson put it at the time, was ""a man who didn’t mind taking 13 or 14 tall drinks now and then"") and had undergone electroshock treatment on multiple occasions. The Democratic National Committee replaced Eagleton with Sargent Shriver, and aside from making a ton of ""McGovern-Eagleton"" signs and buttons instant collector’s items, the substitution was recognized by every state. If a Trump resignation and replacement were to happen this month, that’s probably how it would go down again. The real trouble would begin if the resign-and-replace saga drags into that gray zone where states are printing ballots to send to absentee or by-mail voters. There are plenty of incidents (though not at the presidential level!) where dead candidates have been kept on the ballot and have even won, most recently in Missouri in 2000, when Governor Mel Carnahan defeated John Ashcroft in a Senate election held a couple of weeks after he died in a plane crash. In that case, the posthumous candidacy was mitigated by the public announcement by Carnahan’s successor as governor that his widow would be appointed to the seat in his stead. The odds of Trump staying in the race and then withdrawing so late as to present this kind of problem are significantly lower than the already very long odds that he will do anything other than stick to his candidacy until the bitter end and perhaps beyond (if his preemptive talk about the election being ""rigged"" is any indication of his intentions). If Trump does in fact withdraw very late, then it will mostly supply support to another conspiracy theory: that the mogul is a Democratic double agent.","9) are reasonably clear: If a presidential nominee dies or withdraws, the RNC is empowered to replace her or him via one of two methods: (1) a vote by the RNC itself in which each state would cast the same number of votes as it possessed at the recent national convention, or (2) an actual reconvening of said convention."
2970,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. You've seen them at Starbucks, I'm sure. They don't know what they want. They think the barista should know what they want. Or they come in with an attitude and speak with a tone that would even offend Donald Trump. What can you do? A certain proportion of humanity is rude. My own entirely non-scientific research suggests that it's around 40 percent and rising. A business owner has to just deal with it. Or throw them out, of course. But then there's Marisel Valencia Madrid. She doesn't want to get into a fight with customers. She had a far better, beautifully businesslike idea. She charges them more. If you go into her Restaurant Blau Grifeu and throw your weight around, offer excessive self-importance or generally behave like an annoying twerp, she charges you more for your coffee. Conversely, if you're polite, sweet and behave in a civilized manner, she charges you 40 percent or more less. If you can keep up with my peculiar construction there. Madrid is from Colombia. Which is another peculiar sentence. Just to complicate things, Madrid's restaurant is in Spain. In Llançà, near Girona, to be precise. She told the London Times that she was surprised how rude Spaniards can be these days. ""People seem to be in a rush these days and forgetting to say 'please' when they ask for something,"" she said. So her menu has a very simple rubric: Un café 5 Euros Un café, por favor 3 Euros. Buenos Días, Un Café Por Favor 1.30 Euros. Madrid isn't even the first to try this highly sensible maneuver. The Petite Syrah Café in Nice, France started it as something of a joke. Owner Fabrice Pepino told the Local: ""At lunchtime people would come in very stressed and were sometimes rude to us when they ordered a coffee."" It's hard to know whether stress is destroying us even more quickly than technology. Perhaps the latter contributes to the former in a circle that is virtual, but not virtuous. We're constantly being pursued by something, as much as we're constantly pursuing something. As our friends become as virtual as our memories of calm, considered relaxation, we're becoming awful people who think the online, on-demand economy allows us an economy of words, gestures and even basic courtesies. In my local Starbucks, those basic courtesies are still observed by many. There's a certain unspoken agreement that life is an unfair fight that we're bound to lose. So customers tend to be pleasant, if occasionally unsure of where they actually are. Perhaps, though, Starbucks -- whose CEO Howard Schultz is known for his social and political activism -- might experiment with the Pepino-Madrid Convention. I've been to many a New York Starbucks, for example, where the staff are a lot more pleasant than the customers. What a delight it would be to suddenly slap what is, in effect, a rudeness tax on their lattes. My suggestions are as follows: Ordering coffee while you're talking on your phone: $9 Ordering coffee while you're texting or looking at Instagram: $8 Ordering coffee without saying 'please' or 'thank you': $8. Ordering coffee while talking on your phone and not saying 'please' or 'thank you': $25. These prices, naturally, should be doubled for any Starbucks in the vicinity of Wall Street.",charges you more for your coffee
2973,"After weeks of anticipation, researchers have pried open the lid of a small, approximately 1,700-year-old coffin discovered last month in a field near Leicestershire, England. While more analysis will be necessary, a preliminary examination suggests the coffin was the final resting place for a little girl from a wealthy Christian family. Scientists from Archaeology Warwickshire carefully examined the coffin before opening it this week, noting that what remained of the burial box was made from a single sheet of lead and sealed at the corners with molten lead, the BBC reports. Attempts to peer inside the coffin using an endoscope proved futile, as it had become filled with clay silt. Although the body has long since decomposed, researchers were able to recover fragmentary skeletal remains and two jet bangles, or bracelets, according to a statement released by Archaeology Warwickshire. ""We will carefully sift through these over the coming weeks to recover as much as possible and determine if there is anything suitable for detailed analysis,"" Archaeology Warwickshire Business Manager Stuart Palmer said in the statement. ""This will include the submission of a sample for a radiocarbon date which we hope will narrow down the possible date range for the burial."" These tests could include anything from soil micromorphology to inorganic geochemical testing and trace organic chemical analyses, reports the Tamworth Herald, a local newspaper that has been carefully covering the coffin's discovery. But Palmer noted that while there is still much lab work to be done, the team's early investigatory efforts have already proved illuminating. ""Finding the two jet bangles was a surprise,"" Palmer said in the statement. ""They rather suggest that the child was female although we cannot say with certainty if they were worn as bracelets, clothing adornments or were woven into long hair."" The coffin was initially discovered in October by metal detectorists from the Digging Up The Past Metal Detecting Club. The amateur historians took turns guarding the coffin alongside local authorities until it could be safely removed from the plowed Leicester field where it had been found. ""[The coffin's discovery] is important because it's a rare opportunity to look at the burial customs, the environment and the type of clothing,"" Palmer said, according to the BBC. ""We hope it will shed much needed light on a remote period of our past."" Archaeology Warwickshire is conducting a poll in order to name the unidentified Roman child. The group is asking the public to vote for five possible monikers, all based on Roman words, LiveScience notes.

The fast-food giant swapped out the traditional Happy Meal toy for a Step-It fitness tracker for a limited time in the US and Canada, USA Today reported The fitness trackers were part of a larger goal at McDonald's to project a healthier image.

""A lot of people have assumptions about what McDonald's food is,"" McDonald's corporate chef Jessica Foust told Business Insider in July . ""The industry in general is challenged because there's a stigma in general about what [quick-service restaurant] food is, and that is very very unfortunate. Personally, I don't think that helps people eat well."" AP Photo/Keith Srakocic The Happy Meal has long been a point of contention at McDonald's. Critics of the chain have pointed to the meal, complete with a toy, as evidence of a plot by McDonald's to make fattening meals more appealing to children in particular, playing a role in increasing childhood obesity rates. Many parents are now wary of feeding their kids food from McDonald's, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report last year, noting that Starbucks was gaining an advantage. ""Starbucks is virtually the only large incumbent that can offer millennial parents the convenience of a (fast food chain) and food they would not feel guilty/embarrassed to feed to their kids,"" Goldman Sachs' analysts wrote at the time. In 2004, McDonald's added apples as an option for kids' meals.

But Tesla has black, white and tan ones. Here’s why they can do it. Red seat belt buttons look a bit out of place in luxury cars. Take this Mercedes S-Class interior, for example. It’s filled with wood, metal, leather, plastic pretending to look like leather, and glass. But then there are those bright red seat belt buckle release buttons that look very much like they could have come from the Fisher-Price catalogue. Most other cars have red buttons.

No other part of the buckle shall be of this colour."" The corresponding U.S. regulation, FMVSS 209, does not specify a required buckle button color, hence why Tesla is able to use interior color-matched buttons, but only on U.S. spec models. Why don’t you see other cars with the elegant black plastic buttons instead of the chintzy red ones? That likely has to do with cost savings, as manufacturers try to commonize restraints across all markets.

2978,"Twenty years ago, a baseball game froze in time. And out onto the lush green grass of Shea Stadium, in the middle of the fifth inning, walked three people. One was Rachel Robinson, wife of the late, great Jackie Robinson. One was the commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig. The third? It was merely the president of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. They were there to do something that had never been done before: retire a number, Jackie Robinson's 42, across an entire sport. And to do their part to ensure that the power of Robinson's major league debut, 50 years earlier to the day, would keep resonating through history. This is the story of that night, April 15, 1997 -- and its aftermath -- through the eyes of the men and women who lived it. BUD SELIG (commissioner for 22 years, now commissioner emeritus, making his stunning announcement to the crowd that night): Major League Baseball is taking the unprecedented step of retiring uniform No. 42 in perpetuity. ... No. 42 belongs to Jackie Robinson for the ages. LEN COLEMAN (then the National League president, later the chairman of the Jackie Robinson Foundation for 18 years): I actually got put in charge of orchestrating the festivities for the 15th, and I was struggling in thinking about what we were going to do to capture the moment ... that would be totally distinctive, that would separate Jackie from every other ballplayer and capture the significance of his accomplishment. I was driving on the Garden State Parkway, and it was like a lightning bolt hit: ""Retire his number from the whole game."" I thought about it as I was driving, and I said, ""That's it. I'm going to go to Bud and say: 'Let's retire the number.'"" SELIG: You know, there's always pressure on [retiring] numbers. And you've got to be so careful, and I really mean that. But this one, to me, there was just no question about it. This Jackie Robinson thing was really special, and so it just appealed to me greatly. ... In the [college] course I teach -- which is ""Baseball in American History, 1945 to the present"" -- I start with Jackie Robinson. He's my first lecture every September. I really believe [his first game] was the most powerful and important moment in baseball history. COLEMAN: When Bud agreed to retire the number, there were only a few of us who knew about it. That's one time we actually kept a secret. At the time, secrets lasted about two seconds in baseball. But that one held. SHARON ROBINSON (Jackie's daughter, now MLB's educational consultant and the manager of Breaking Barriers: In Sports, In Life): Len called us first and gave us the heads-up that this was going to happen, just a few days in advance. And my mom and I were like, ""Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing?"" What about Mo Vaughn? What about all the players that we knew at the time were wearing No. 42? Some of them were wearing it to honor my dad. ... So when they walked out on that field, I remember sort of holding my breath, because we had anxiety over how the retirement of the No. 42 would be received. We weren't sure how the fans were going to take it. But when Bud announced it, they jumped out of their seats. We just couldn't believe it. The fans jumped out of their seats and stood up and cheered. So we knew it was the right decision. SELIG (to the crowd that night): Throughout its long history, Major League Baseball has operated under the premise that no single person is bigger than the game -- no single person other than Jackie Robinson. CLAIRE SMITH (who covered the ceremony for The New York Times): When he announced it, there was a collective gasp in the stadium, and around baseball. I was stunned. Obviously, it had never been done before in Major League Baseball to universally retire one number. And in the four major sports, it had not been done. ... Jackie Robinson is my hero. He's why I write. And that was the most moving thing I'd ever seen on a baseball field. PA announcement following the top of the fifth inning that night: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, Rachel Robinson and Bud Selig. BERNARD GILKEY (former New York Mets outfielder): The whole country was watching. And time just stopped in the middle of the baseball game. ... You'll never see it again. GENE ORZA (former COO of the players' association): I approached [former commissioner] Peter Ueberroth in 1986 about celebrating the 40th anniversary [of Robinson's debut]. My idea was to stop all play on April 15 of 1987 and play only one game. And it would be the Dodgers against the Braves because [Robinson's] first game was played against the Boston Braves. And we would invite the president, who was Ronald Reagan, and Tip O'Neill and anybody else. He said he would talk about it with the clubs. He got back to me and said there wasn't much enthusiasm for stopping play in the middle of a game. ... Then, in 1995, when Cal Ripken made his 2,131st official game appearance [in a row], that took place, obviously, after 41⁄2 innings -- and they stopped the game in the middle of the game. So now they couldn't tell me any longer that you can't interrupt play. So I renewed the request. I said, ""In '97, we should do something like have the president of the United States come out to second base, stand on it and give a speech."" COLEMAN: I remember at the time, President Clinton had injured his [knee]. But I remember he went right out and he addressed the crowd. It was just a totally dramatic moment. PRESIDENT CLINTON (to the crowd that night): It is hard to believe that it was 50 years ago at Ebbets Field that a 28-year-old rookie changed the face of baseball and the face of America forever. Jackie Robinson scored the go-ahead run that day. And we've all been trying to catch up ever since. BRANCH B. RICKEY (president of the Pacific Coast League and grandson of Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson): You know, I don't remember as much of the specifics [of the ceremony] as I remember the aura and the emotion of the fact that this was a celebration that was much larger than the normal old, ""Here we are awarding a certificate to so and so for the accomplishment of such and such."" ... This man, and what he represented and portrayed, is a hero, but not of athletic proportion. He transcends anything athletic. We weren't celebrating an athletic event on that night. We were celebrating in an athletic stadium. COLEMAN: For Jackie and what he did for all of America in integrating America's pastime, it just elevated him to another level. And I felt particularly pleased because his relationship with Rachel was a total partnership. Rachel was a force in her own right. So she was standing right there, and I remember that smile on her face. SHARON ROBINSON: I think part of why he remembers that smile so well is that my mom often kind of protects her emotions. But when President Clinton arrived, and the three of them went out, it was her moment, as well as a moment for my dad. LANCE JOHNSON (former Mets outfielder, who drove in the first two runs minutes after the ceremony ended and the game resumed): There was an aura. A presence. Kind of like a godly presence. A special feeling. You just don't walk around with that feeling all the time. ... Emotionally, it was like this: Remember when Jose Fernandez died and then [Dee Gordon] came up and hit the home run, and he never hit home runs? His heart and his soul was into that game because he was playing for Fernandez. I know it's not the same thing, but it was like that. I put my everything into that historical moment. It was emotional like that. RACHEL ROBINSON (on the field that night): This anniversary has given us an opportunity as a nation to celebrate together the triumphs of the past and the social progress that has occurred. It has also given us an opportunity to reassess the challenges of the present. COLEMAN: I look at that No. 42 every time I walk into a ballpark. What it signifies to me is, I'm a kid of the civil rights movement. So I lived through all of that. So in a way, when I look at that number, it takes me back. And it symbolizes what we've come through as a country, thanks to people like Jackie. And it also symbolizes hope for the future. SHARON ROBINSON: I remember the years I used to travel. ... I just remember sitting in the stands, listening to people -- they didn't know who I was -- and hearing them talk about No. 42: Why is it up there? Why is it a different color? I'd hear them talking to their children, sharing the experience. And I remember not saying anything, just because I wanted to hear people's reaction to it. It made me feel so good that it opened up discussion, because that's what you really want. It's symbolic of social change. And it's not just a moment. It's an ongoing change. It's a reflection on history, and how the past informs the present. And what does this tell us about the future? And what lessons can we learn that can be carried forward? SELIG: I really believe that on April 15, 1997, we really changed the culture. So with that number retired now and [every player wearing it] every April 15, it's important, because life is funny. People forget. They're there. They're gone. They forget. That may be why the culture change was the most meaningful thing. Now every player ... should never forget what Jackie Robinson did and what Branch Rickey did. FRED CLAIRE (then the Los Angeles Dodgers' GM): The key thing for baseball, in 1997 and now -- even more so now -- is the continuation of Jackie's message. It was not enough then, and it's not enough now to simply be about a number. PRESIDENT CLINTON (on the field that night): I can't help thinking that if Jackie Robinson were here with us tonight, he would say that we have done a lot of good in the last 50 years, but we can do better. GILKEY: The small percentage of African-American players in the major leagues now bewilders me. I mean, 8 percent? JOHNSON: I don't think Jackie would be happy with the numbers of blacks that are playing in baseball. He'd be disappointed. SMITH: I think that it would probably have broken Jackie's heart that there was not a lot of proactive recruiting and selling of the sport done by the folks that picked up the glove and supposedly picked up his legacy. ... When it became obvious that these numbers were dwindling, where was baseball's LeBron James? We probably had a lot of Michael Jordans who were just making a lot of money, but they were selling their brand. They weren't selling their own game. CLAIRE: In 1972, it wasn't enough for Jackie just to throw out the first ball of the World Series. He wanted to speak because he wanted to continue the message. And what resonates with me is that when you go through Jackie's words, they are so powerful. And they need to be carried on within baseball and within society. And the one that resonates most is this quote: ""A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives."" PRESIDENT CLINTON (that night): Today, I think we should remember that Jackie Robinson's legacy did not end with baseball. For afterward, he spent the rest of his life trying to open other doors and keep them open for all kinds of people. SMITH: When the president is out there and he's talking about Jackie Robinson and equality and the occasion being something bigger than baseball, you're hanging on every word. And you know you're witnessing something that in the moment is bigger than anything you've probably ever seen. And now, 20 years later, it's kind of a melancholy feeling, knowing that it probably was in the moment. And there's a little letdown, knowing that in 2017, not a lot has changed. CLAIRE: It's so disappointing to me, because when you see that [8 percent] figure -- and this gets right to the heart of what Jackie was trying to say -- of young blacks not entering the game and not having the opportunities in the game; we have so much to do. There's an obligation here that goes so far beyond a salute to Jackie Robinson one day a year. SHARON ROBINSON: I think [that 8 percent] really reflects once again on the fact that struggle is ongoing. All struggle is ongoing. And that's what my dad told me when I was 13: ""You don't change something and everything's fine. You have to stay on it and be vigilant and conscious and be willing to stand up for what you believe in -- for the rest of your life.""","They were there to do something that had never been done before: retire a number, Jackie Robinson's 42, across an entire sport"
2982,"Authorities in West Virginia are trying to locate a missing teenager who disappeared while walking to a relative's home. Lilly Neff, 16, of Ansted, was last seen at about 4 a.m. on Saturday, when she left a rental cabin in Hico to walk to a relative's home in the Danese area. Danese is located about 17 miles southeast of Hico, according to the Fayette County Sheriff's Department.

2984,"Consuming cannabis while pregnant can have serious social repercussions. In some states, you may even have your child taken away. But, are these harsh concerns about prenatal cannabis use really accurate? Recent research suggests that the herb may be less harmful than we make it out to be. A new study says that smoking cannabis while pregnant is OK, as long as it’s in moderation. Maternal marijuana use isn’t a risk factor A team lead by Dr. Shayna Conner set out to determine whether or not prenatal cannabis use is associated with negative health consequences. They performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that compared rates of cannabis consumption to birth outcomes. It is unethical to perform potentially harmful health experiments on pregnant women, so the majority of research on cannabis and pregnancy are observational and cell line studies. After examining all of the data, the team found two primary outcomes popped up consistently: low birth weight and preterm delivery. Those who oppose cannabis use often use these two potential impacts as an argument against the herb. However, this new study found something interesting. After sorting out tobacco use and other confounding factors, the researchers found no statistical correlation between cannabis use and any negative birth outcome. This lead them to conclude, Maternal marijuana use during pregnancy is not an independent risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes after adjusting for confounding factors. Thus, the association between maternal marijuana use and adverse outcomes appears attributable to concomitant tobacco use and other confounding factors. The article was published online ahead of print and will be available in the October 2016 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology.* It can currently be found in the Wolters Kluwer database. (http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/pages/results.aspx?txtkeywords=conner%2c+shayna). Tobacco + cannabis increases risks It’s important to note that this study found that when used independently, cannabis does not seem to increase the risk of negative birth outcomes. When you combine the herb with tobacco, however, your risk of low birth weight and premature birth increases. If you are pregnant and want to avoid any risks, do not consume alcohol, tobacco, or other harmful drugs. Though cannabis has a wide range of therapeutic uses, the herb doesn’t seem to be enough to protect your baby from the harms of prenatal tobacco use. Why in moderation? Overall, Dr. Conner is still apprehensive about cannabis use during pregnancy. She tells NPR, Any foreign substance that doesn’t directly benefit maternal or fetal health should be avoided.-Conner Yet, she also articulates that when it comes to preventing negative birth outcomes, public health dollars should be put toward substances which have a greater risk of harm. This includes tobacco. She also notes that her study did not look at long-term mental health and behavioral impacts like ADD/ADHD. There is some evidence that heavy cannabis consumption during early pregnancy may increase the likelihood of behavioral complications later in life. However, even these studies have produced variable results. Many cannabis studies fail to exclude tobacco and alcohol use and they do not discriminate between cannabis containing THC and high-CBD varieties of the herb. Further, there is also interesting evidence to counter these claims. A longitudinal study of Jamaican women from the 1980s followed cannabis-exposed and nonexposed children from birth to age 5. When the children were 5-years-old, the research team conducted a variety of tests, including the McCarthy Test of Children’s Abilities. Lead researcher Melanie Dreher found no difference between the exposed children and nonexposed children in terms of ability or academic performance. What we still need The only way we will know for sure how the herb impacts child development is through more studies. Conner’s research suggests that there is no evidence thus far that cannabis has harmful neonatal impacts. However, to weed out the truth about long-term implications of cannabis use, we still need research that follows children into adolescence and adulthood. We also need research that looks at cannabis use alone without confounding factors. As well as research on the differing effects of THC and other cannabinoids. Unfortunately, studies of this depth are difficult to execute. Regardless, it seems like there are many things that are a lot worse for you than cannabis.","smoking cannabis while pregnant is OK, as long as it’s in moderation"
2986,"People hold up candles against a rainbow-lit backdrop during a Sunday vigil for those killed in a mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. (David Goldman/AP) When our synagogue heard about the horrific tragedy that took place at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it was at the same time that we were celebrating our festival of Shavuot, which celebrates God’s giving of the Torah. As Orthodox Jews, we don’t travel or use the Internet on the Sabbath or on holidays, such as Shavuot. But on Sunday night, as we heard the news, I announced from the pulpit that as soon as the holiday ended at 9:17 p.m. Monday, we would travel from our synagogue in Northwest Washington to a gay bar as an act of solidarity. We just wanted to share the message that we were all in tremendous pain and that our lives were not going on as normal. Even though the holiday is a joyous occasion, I felt tears in my eyes as I recited our sacred prayers. I had not been to a bar in more than 20 years. And I had never been to a gay bar. Someone in the congregation told me about a bar called the Fireplace, so I announced that as our destination. Afterward, I found out it was predominantly frequented by gay African Americans. Approximately a dozen of us, wearing our kippot, or yarmulkes, went down as soon as the holiday ended. Some of the members of our group are gay, but most are not. We did not know what to expect. As we gathered outside, we saw one large, drunk man talking loudly and wildly. I wondered whether we were in the right place. Then my mother, who was with me, went up to a man who was standing on the side of the building. She told him why we were there. He broke down in tears and told us his cousin was killed at Pulse. He embraced us and invited us into the Fireplace. We didn’t know what to expect, but it turned out that we had so much in common. We met everyone in the bar. One of the patrons told me that his stepchildren were actually bar-mitzvahed in our congregation. Another one asked for my card so that his church could come and visit. The bartender shut off all of the music in the room, and the crowd became silent as we offered words of prayer and healing. My co-clergy Maharat Ruth Friedman shared a blessing related to the holiday of Shavuot, and she lit memorial candles on the bar ledge. Then everyone in the bar put their hands around each other’s shoulders, and we sang soulful tunes. After that, one of our congregants bought a round of beer for the whole bar. Everyone in the bar embraced each other. It was powerful and moving and real and raw. After that we moved to the outdoor makeshift memorial service at Dupont Circle. There, too, we did not know what to expect. But as we gathered around the circle, people kept coming up to us and embracing us. One man we met there told us that his daughter sometimes prays with us. Others were visiting from Los Angeles but joined in full voice, clearly knowing the Hebrew words to the song we were singing. As we were singing, I looked over at some gay members of our congregation and saw tears flowing down their faces. I felt the reality that we are living in a time of enormous pain. But I also felt that the night was a tremendous learning experience for me. I learned that when a rabbi and members of an Orthodox synagogue walk into a gay African American bar, it is not the opening line of a joke but an opportunity to connect; it is an opportunity to break down barriers and come together as one; it is an opportunity to learn that if we are going to survive, we all need each other. 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What the investigation into the Orlando mass shooting looks like View Photos Officials are scouring the site and others in the area for information about the June 12 massacre.

2991,"[In this image there is a blue sky and blurred light brown field in the background. There is a white woman with a chubby face and she is grinning with a closed mouth. She has strawberry blonde straight hair. She has a white scarf with red designs on it around her neck. Photo by Jerre B. Fine.] Oh my goodness, I just spent 30 days taking pictures of my nearly naked 311 pound body and posting them on the Internet. I just spent two hours a day for 30 days learning what my body looks like in its entirety while inviting the belief that it is beautiful exactly as it is. Holy crap! I took pictures of my nearly naked body in very public spaces while operating from the belief that I am powerful and beautiful. Sweet baby Jesus, I asked for support from friends, family and strangers to help me through the process of dismantling a core belief that I am lacking desirability because of the size of my body. Praise all things holy and sinful, you know what I figured out? I am indeed desirous, powerful, beautiful and capable of stepping into brilliance, completely rooted in love and possibility! As a part of my regular art process, I walk through my neighborhood at night, listening to music, dancing in the streets and writing love poems in chalk EVERYWHERE! One night, just over a month ago, I was stewing in series of quotes and phrases, ""I Dare U 2 Be,"" ""Be Brilliant,"" ""Be Brave,"" ""Remember the Magic,"" ""Tackle the Mother Fucking Shit Out of Love"" (side note, Cheryl Strayed wrote the best definition of love I have ever encountered, read Tiny Beautiful Things and you will see). As I was walking I thought about my body and what it would look like to dare being brilliant, brave, magical and in love with my body. At first I wrote ""be Vulnerable"" across my stomach, then I realized seeing myself as beautiful is one of my greatest vulnerabilities so I wrote ""BE BEAUTIFUL"" across my stomach, snapped a photo, shared it and declared via social media that for 30 days I would redefine beauty. I decided to call the project the ""BE BEAUTIFUL Project."" The project was largely influenced by The Body is Not an Apology's 30 day RUHCUS PROJECT. In doing the BE BEAUTIFUL project, I dated my body for 30 days. I took it to all my favorite places, put it in juxtaposition with some of my favorite pieces of art. Every day I took time to recognize how beautifully fierce, and gracious my body really is. When it was in joy I met it there; when it was in sadness I honored its sadness; when it was sassy I bore witness to its sass. Each date commemorated with a photo of my body and the words ""BE BEAUTIFUL"" written on it. With every photo I found something new and inviting about the house I've been living in for 34 years, the one I never paid mind to. It was not easy at all, but love is not easy and learning to practice self love has been worth every ounce of the struggle. Challenging an internalized belief that I am lacking desirability because of the size of my body is a necessary service to my work, my community and myself. Over the past few months I have been blessed to be part of a body politic think tank at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. As a group we are engaging the question ""what sits on the other side of my body's shame and joy?"" That is a hard question to answer. For me, in order to understand what sits on the other side of body shame and body joy, I have to engage my internalized body shame and invite the possibilities of body joy. Given that I have been a woman of size my entire life raised in poor, suburban, white, American culture my core belief systems are steeped in shame and invisibility. What better way to challenge those internalized beliefs than to examine images of my body on a social network setting -- a place completely at the intersection of my given family, people I grew up with, people who only know me in the context of art, and my current chosen family. The first picture I shared I was wearing a bright orange tight fitted slip, in black letters I wrote, ""BE BEAUTIFUL"" across my belly. [In this image: there is grey carpet on the floor. There is portion of a white wall on the right and a the border of a white mirror. In the mirror's reflection is a large woman's body from the waist down. Her elbows are up at her side. She is wearing a tight fitted orange slip that stops mid thigh with a flat lace orange panel on the front of the dress. She has fair white legs. She is standing.] I wanted to vomit when I shared the image on my social media page. I was so scared of all the horrible things people would say in response to the picture. Contrary to the voices in my head, nearly all the responses I received were in love and support, all except one. A woman I do not know said, ""I hate it when anyone wears skin tight clothing. There are so few people who can wear this kind of outfit."" I was crushed. I waited, terrified, to see if anyone would respond. Then my badass, foxy, fat friend Sara McChristian responded with ""anyone can wear this kind of outfit -- if it's comfy then wear it -- if it makes you feel good then wear it -- if you don't like it don't wear it -- but the notion of ""so few"" is invalid -- pull it over your head or zip it up -- put on some sexy shoes -- accessorize -- and rock on with your bad self."" All I could think was, ""AMEN, thank you! Holy crap thank you, now I can keep going. I am not alone. I am not alone."" Thankfully, there weren't too many more hater bumps in the 30 days. The few times there were all I had to do was ask people for support and knowing it was there made it possible for me to keep going. My history and upbringing have made it hard for me to ask for help and support but it has been necessary in this journey and no time more than during my final picture. In early August, I was coming home from San Francisco to the East Bay on the subway and was harassed to the point of having to sneak off the train in order to get away from a frighteningly aggressive man. I have not experienced that type of harassment much in my life. One of the occasional privileges that come with being a larger bodied white woman is that I am often seen as a mama, best friend, or invisible. Which is to say, I am generally not sexualized. In shooting the final photo for the project I wanted to reclaim the subway as a safe space so I reached out and asked my community to join me for my final shoot on the train. I also asked my best friend and platonic life partner, Sonya Renee Taylor, to help me get ready. Sonya challenged me to engage a body ritual prior to the shoot. In the ritual she said a prayer for each part of my body -- all the places I held shame around over this 30-day journey. She then wrote the word ""beautiful"" in bold black letters on each part. I wept, laughed, felt incredibly seen and awkward all the same time. It was grounding and powerful to exist in that vulnerability with someone. When I arrived at the train station I was so thankful to see such a broad spectrum of people come in support of my reclaiming. My friend Airial Clark took the picture, while a crew of badass friends stood in front of me keeping watch. Having them there made it possible for me to boldly stand in my lacy panties and bra with ""beautiful"" written all over my body. I felt seen, protected, powerful, vulnerable, and affirmed. It was a necessary completion and I am forever grateful. [In this image: A large white woman is standing on a subway train with her arms outstretched. ""Beautiful"" is written in black marker across both of her arms, across her belly and down her thighs. Her hair is pulled up in a bun. She is wearing brown and silver framed glasses and large orange earrings. She is wearing a black bra and lacy black panties. She has on red shiny ballet slipper shoes. There is a man sitting on a subway seat to the left. His hand is near his face and he is looking away. There are several men in the background and a bicycle to the left.] The active practice of loving myself exactly as I am is radical self love. It is loving all 311 pounds of my glorious body out loud in public. It is engaging, challenging and dismantling the story that I am lacking desirability because of the size of my body. Doing this work in community with people who not only helped create that belief, but with the people who have spent years loving me as my most powerful self, feels revolutionary. My hope is that this project serves as an invitation for everyone to investigate their perceptions of beauty, in themselves and others. Most importantly, spending two hours a day for 30 days invested In seeing the parts of my body that have been made invisible and shamed as actually beautiful has made it possible for me to see others in full visibility and love. I am whole, perfect, and complete exactly as I am and exactly as I am not which is to say: I am absolutely beautiful and so are you.","In doing the BE BEAUTIFUL project, I dated my body for 30 days."

Why airlines ask you to lift up the window shades for takeoffs and landings. The FAA requires that every airplane can be fully evacuated in 90 seconds or less.

2999,"Millennial men, hang onto your wallets. Phone scams are soaring, and you’re far more likely than any other group to get taken -- and taken big. Roughly 22.1 million Americans lost an estimated $9.5 billion to phone scams last year -- up a whopping 56 percent from 2015, according to a new study sponsored by Truecaller, a spam-fighting phone app. That amounts to nearly one in every 10 American adults. However, men between the ages of 18 and 34 are three-times more likely to be victimized than the overall population, according to Truecaller’s Harris poll of more than 2,000 adults. One-third of millennial males say they’ve lost money in a phone con, according to Truecaller.  Just 11 percent of millennial women lost money in a phone scam. However, both genders become more skeptical as they age. Only 9 percent of the average adult population has lost money in a phone scam. Robocalls aren’t just annoying; they can be the first step in stealing your money. In ""We don’t know why young men are so susceptible,"" said Tom Hsieh, a vice president at Truecaller. ""But one of the important things to understand is that no one is immune."" Notably, telemarketing scams once mainly targeted landlines, but they’re increasing moving to the mobile world. In the past year, 72 percent of victims said they were contacted by cell. Two years ago, less than half of phone-scam victims were on a mobile line, according to the survey. The average amount lost is also soaring, too. In 2016, it amounted to a $430 vs. $274 in 2015. The scams run the gamut from fraudsters posing as IRS agents to those supposedly raising cash for charities, Hsieh added. By and large, the cons start with some form of robocall, which allows con artists to dial hundreds of numbers at once. Truecaller’s latest survey found 87 percent of American adults said they’ve received at least one robocall call in the past month, and more than half reported that they received more than 10 spam calls a month. More than half --  56 percent -- said they had also received at least one spam text per month, while 23 percent said they received six or more spam texts a month.  Last year, 11 percent of U.S. consumers lost approximately $7.4 billion to phone-related fraud, and there's a new crop of scams this year. Jill S... This research largely mirrors monthly data from YouMail, which also tracks spam calls. YouMail, which provides visual voicemail and spam-blocking services, said received U.S. robocalls rose 11 percent in March to an estimated 2.45 billion. But residents of some cities are far more likely to receive spam calls than others. The YouMail Robocall Index finds the most robocalled cities are Atlanta; Washington, D.C.; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Memphis; New York; Little Rock, Arkansas; Macon, Georgia; New Orleans; Dallas and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Except in Atlanta -- where you get robocalls daily, residents of each of these cities receive an average of one robocall every two days. These calls are more than a nuisance. They’re the entry point for most phone-based scams, experts say. The best way to avoid them is simple -- don’t pick up the phone. Scammers rarely leave a message. You can also install antispam programs, such as those offered by YouMail, TrueCaller, Hiya and Nomorobo.

More than 10 million tonnes of garbage swirls through all the world's oceans, flowing with diverging currents in what's been called a ""trash vortex,"" or, alternatively, the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch."" Known for being virtually impossible to clean up, these accumulation zones remained relatively untouched since their discovery in the late 1980s -- aside from research and scientific expeditions to better conclude a solution. Now, for the first time ever, an effort to clean up the millions of square kilometres that make up the trash vortex is underway. SUMMER 2016: Visit the Summer Forecast Guide to the Season for the 2016 Summer Forecast, Fall Weather Preview and much more A prototype ocean cleaning system, developed by a Dutch organization, has been released in off the coast of the Netherlands in the North Sea, ABC News reports. The Ocean Cleanup -- the CEO of which founded the organization at 17 years old -- is self-described as ""the first feasible method to clean up the world's ocean garbage patches."" The project uses a floating barrier to capture ""virtually any type of debris,"" operating on rotational currents. The barriers use a screen rather than a net to catch garbage, allowing marine wildlife to pass underneath along the current without getting trapped. The organization's site notes that over the course of ten years, a single 100 km stretch of ""artificial coastline"" can grab nearly half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Their mission is to achieve the largest ocean clean-up in history. The prototype's objective is not to see how much garbage can be caught, but rather if the technology can withstand the rough currents in the North Sea, CEO Boyan Slat told ABC News. The final clean-up is expected to begin by 2020. Thumbnail image courtesy of NOAA, Wikimedia Commons.

3007,"EA Confirms Battlefield Remasters To Be Developed Under One Condition With Activision releasing a remastered Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare later this year and the rising popularity of backwards compatibility, it looks like EA might draft up some remastered Battlefield games in the future. Even though the overall production of remastered games has slowed down for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it is still something that players desire, especially when it comes to beloved games that many gamers spent hours upon hours playing on last gen consoles. Talk of remastered Battlefield games can be exciting, especially since the original title, Battlefield 1942, was only released on PC and might be a great addition to the ever-growing collection of first-person shooters available on consoles. Patrick Soderlund, EA Studios Executive Vice-President, had a recent interview with International Business Times and the topic of remastered Battlefield games was brought up. It looks like there isn’t currently a remaster in the works as of yet, but if there is enough demand from fans the tables can absolutely be turned. ""I wouldn’t say never. We’re not doing it right now, we’re focused on Battlefield 1 – but if we think the fans want that I see no reason we couldn’t."" – Patrick Soderlund Soderlund further discussed additional details on the upcoming release of Battlefield 1, touching on Zeppelins, the ability to ride horses, and the implementation of aquatic vehicles. With so much work involved with this game, it’s no wonder that remastered versions of previous Battlefield games is not currently on the priority list. This is the first Battlefield game in many years to take place during the past as opposed to a modern setting, so it can be suggested that EA has listened to what fans actually want to play and made it happen. With that being said, fans wanting remastered Battlefield games should voice their opinions and keep their fingers crossed that EA will listen to them again.",if we think the fans want that

3013,"Talk about a throwback; those ads stopped running during the Bush administration. But according to a survey released this week by researchers at investment bank Piper Jaffray, that's what most teens are like these days. Remember Apple's iPod silhouette ads ? The psychedelic TV spots where people would dance hyperactively with an MP3 player in their hand and headphones in their ears? After surveying a national group of 7,200 teens, analysts at the research arm of Piper Jaffray discovered that teens like listening to music the 2000-and-late way, through downloaded music onto iTunes libraries or MP3 players: That's 42 percent of teens listening to music through MP3s, according to the bank. But what does that statistic mean? Piper Jaffray told us that the ""42 percent"" figure was compiled from four survey questions, but it hasn't revealed how. Nor has it indicated what that percentage indicates—whether it's 42 percent of teens preferring MP3s over other options, or if it's that, 42 percent of the time they listen to music, teens are using MP3s to do it. Even with the little information, it's enough to ask: Do teens actually listen to MP3s? Consider, first, the dubious finding that Pandora and other streaming methods together attracted only 31 percent of teens. (That category also includes Spotify and sites like Songza.) And consider too that just six months ago—the last time the survey was conducted—only 35 percent of teens said they used MP3s. That's a 13 percent increase this year for MP3s. Given those stats, maybe Apple shouldn't have discontinued the iPod. Not so fast. The survey's lumping of Spotify, Songza, and other streaming sites into, well, ""other streaming"" brings me to the survey's most glaring omission: Respondents had no way to indicate they listened to YouTube. Two years ago, per this Nielsen report, YouTube was teens' supposedly favorite way to listen to music—64 percent of them said so. That survey broke down like this: 64 percent of teens listen to music through YouTube 56 percent of teens listen to music on the radio 53 percent of teens listen to music through iTunes 50 percent of teens listen to music on CD Note the 53 percent of teens who used iTunes to listen to music. That's not as surprising for 2012, though the Nielsen report strangely didn't include options for Pandora or Spotify, and it completely ignored smaller streaming sites like Grooveshark. Fast forward to 2014. Nielsen's recent analysis of the music industry at large showed a six-percent decrease in digital music sales and a 32-percent increase in overall streaming. According to the company, these changes were largely... because of teens. As Martin Pyykkonnen, an analyst at Wedge Partners, told Yahoo last year, ""Young people today don’t buy music anymore."" Except maybe they do, according to the Piper Jaffray report. Or maybe they don't buy MP3s but do download them. Or maybe they don't download them but do listen to them. Combine these major studies into teenage music consumption habits and you'll find few trends to bet on, and few trends that individual research companies have even followed up on. YouTube is the #1 music source for teens, then it's omitted. MP3s are dying, then they're not. From the surveys available, it may simply be impossible to know exactly how teens consume music. If anything, their range of preferences keeps the music industry's options open, at least until the next era—iPod or otherwise—comes along.","From the surveys available, it may simply be impossible to know exactly how teens consume music"

Pence, speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday morning, criticized President Barack Obama’s prime-time convention speech in which he labeled Trump a homegrown demogogue — and then delivered an eyebrow-raising statement. Pence said, ""I don’t think name calling has any place in public life, and I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that, let alone laced into a sentence like that."" The irony was made richer when Trump soon after launched a barrage of attacks at ""Crooked Hillary Clinton"" and ""Little Michael Bloomberg."" Trump blasted Clinton amid the tweetstorm Friday, boasting how often he was mentioned in her ""very long and very boring speech"" while also accusing her of lying — ""in her very average scream!"" — and losing.

3019,"It’s one of the oldest questions, but there’s yet to be a definitive answer: what size breasts are best? Well, a group of scientists set out to answer it once and for all... For science, we suppose. Researchers gauged over 200 men’s bosom preferences by showing them images of different sized breasts - each pair had different levels of firmness and the men were asked to rate the photos in order of attractiveness. They found that the majority of the participants, who were from Brazil, Cameroon, the Czech Republic and Namibia, preferred medium sized breasts, followed by large sized breasts. And the firmer, the better. But the research paper states: However, a substantial portion of the participants selected either large or small size as their most preferred, indicating considerable inter- individual variation in breast size preferences. So, the study confirms what we already knew, really. Men like breasts. Large, medium or small? It doesn't matter - They just like breasts.  Did we really need a study to confirm that?","a substantial portion of the participants selected either large or small size as their most preferred, indicating considerable inter- individual variation in breast size preferences"

There were no deaths or injuries, but it is certainly a shocking development in the war against the terrorists. Barack Obama, however, really had nothing to say on the issue. In fact, he was busy talking about something else: Global warming. While the country was coming to grips with this new phase in the Iraq conflict, President Obama was busy on Facebook, sending videos warning us of his real adversary... climate change.

And Hillary Clinton thinks we don’t even have any ground troops in Iraq. We have thousands.

3030,"Forget whether or not there is water on Mars - if this photo is to be believed, there is fresh beer on the red planet's surface. An eagle-eyed Mars 'anomaly hunter' has spotted a strange object that looks like a green bottle in Nasa rover imagery. The bizarre bottle shape appears to have a red, green and white label and even a cork or cap at the end. Scroll down for video  Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, when people see patterns in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places. On the red planet, one of the most famous is the 'face on Mars' spotted by one of the Viking orbiters in 1976. This was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes.   The pictures were taken by Nasa's Spirit rover during a mission on the surface of Mars in November 2007. Vigilante Mars 'anomaly hunter' Thomas Miller, 64, spotted the strange shape while he was sifting through Curiosity's latest snaps of the red planet. 'This find is exceptionally clear; the design of the bottle is a bit different but recognisable,' Mr Miller, a Canadian musician, told MailOnline. 'Of course there's no way to know for sure it's a beer bottle, I'm going out on limb calling it that. 'If someday we visit their planet it would be nice to think we could sit down and have a beer with them.' The anomaly hunter found the bottle while browsing through panoramas of Nasa images stitched together by other Mars enthusiasts. 'I think it is evidence of current habitation on Mars,' he told MailOnline. 'We find trash, tools, machine parts, bits of paper, as well as sculpture and carved stone tablets. I tend to see artifacts on the Martian surface as part art gallery and part garbage dump.' But Nigel Watson, an alien expert and author of the UFO Investigations Manual, is sceptical of the bottle find. 'I think they are looking for anything out of the ordinary, and our minds like to see patterns in things. Given the thousands of images of Mars, you are bound to find something that looks a bit unusual,' he told MailOnline. 'Usually clearer pictures or those taken from a different angle show that such anomalies are really rocks or tricks of the light.'  The strange bottle shape is not the first oddity to be spotted on Mars. In December last year, Nasa's Curiosity rover took footage that appeared to show a large spoon on the red planet's surface. It is the second 'spoon' to be found on Mars in recent years, with alien hunters claiming it could be proof of developed life on the planet. Other objects such as rings and gloves have also been found in recent years.  The Curiosity video was uploaded to YouTube by UFO Hunter account 'secure team' with the description: 'There is a giant spoon on Mars! This thing is amazing! Probably left over from a lost civilisation.' And some users were amazed at the discovery - one said: 'Wow, it couldn't possibly be natural, could it?' However, others were more sceptical, suggesting it could be an optical illusion. One user commented: 'We see what we want to see.

3035,"Yesterday, Yesterday, the New York Times reported an indisputable bombshell: Donald Trump has been offering prospective Vice Presidential nominees the chance to run the entire executive office — domestically and internationally: One day this past May, Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before. As a candidate, Kasich Did he have any interest in being the most powerful vice president in history? One day this past May, Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., reached out to a senior adviser to Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who left the presidential race just a few weeks before. As a candidate, Kasich declared in March that Trump was ""really not prepared to be president of the United States,"" and the following month he took the highly unusual step of coordinating with his rival Senator Ted Cruz in an effort to deny Trump the nomination. But according to the Kasich adviser (who spoke only under the condition that he not be named), Donald Jr. wanted to make him an offer nonetheless: When Kasich’s adviser asked how this would be the case, Donald Jr. explained that his father’s vice president would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy. Then what, the adviser asked, would Trump be in charge of? ""Making America great again"" was the casual reply. Not only is this story sourced from the office of the Governor of Ohio, and former Republican presidential candidate, but it is also consistent with the Trump campaign’s prior, explicit statements as early as May 2016 : Not only is this story sourced from the office of the Governor of Ohio, and former Republican presidential candidate, Manafort sat down with the Huffington Post ’s Howard Fineman for a fairly long interview , and while the two covered quite a bit of ground, there was one exchange in particular that stood out for me. Huffington Post The vice presidential pick will also be part of the process of proving he’s ready for the White House, Manafort said. ""He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn’t want to do. He sees himself more as the chairman of the board, than even the CEO, let alone the COO. "" Yes, Melania’s plagiarism was newsworthy (and fun), and Cruz’s non-endorsement was newsworthy (and fun), but how in the world do the above revelations generate less news coverage? (It sure as hell can’t be that they are less fun.) What’s further amazing is that at least in the case of Dick Cheney we had a narrative of a powerful VP assuming and amassing unprecedented power. Here, the presidential candidate, the top-of-the-ticket, is actively seeking to give up power in advance. With that plan, Trump then went out to pick a VP out of an extremely limited pool of willing nominees and by considering ordinary, mundane political considerations. The end result is that voters don't even know what policies they are voting for, or whether the true inauguration speech was the VP nominee’s speech last night. How is this out-in-the-open and simultaneously a non-story? Cynics obviously may say ""Great, let anybody other than Trump be in charge,"" but that ignores that this (i) is just an added level of chaos and danger on top of an already untenable scenario, and (ii) should be an irrefutable, disqualifying argument today.

3046,"We'll give you a clue—the former children's show host did not die of a heroin overdose Hi, out there! Say, do you know what today is? We'll give you a clue—actually, scratch that, you might be a little rusty after all these years, so we'll just tell you: It's the 20th anniversary of Blue's Clues! Indeed, on this very day 20 years ago, a friendly cartoon dog named Blue and her affable human best friend Steve made their television debut of Nickelodeon. In no time at all, Steve (whose real name is Steve Burns) had kids playing Blue's Clues in living rooms across the country. Pre-schoolers were pumped to sing along and parents were thrilled to see their toddlers learning from the TV. Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper were colloquially charming, and their daughter Paprika was quite the saucy little thing. Mailbox always had us laughing with his jokes, and who didn't just love Shovel and Pail? Blue's Clues was filled with colorful characters, but it was the green striped shirt-wearing, 23-year-old guy named Steve who really made the magic happen—right up until 2002. In an episode called ""Steve Goes to College,"" Steve introduced viewers to his brother Joe (played by actor Donovan Patton). Joe, Steve said, would be taking over things at the Blue's Clues house—it was a sensible explanation, but for whatever reason, it didn't sit well with the Steve-loving public. Even though Steve's departure happened before the social media era, rumors about why he really left spread like wildfire. Playground gossip had kids fearing Blue's best friend had died IRL, and parents were subject to all kinds of hoaxes about Steve's untimely death. Fortunately Steve (Burns, the human) is a nice guy (like Steve, his Blue's Clues character) and felt it was important to clear things up. As documented by Snopes.com, he appeared on NBC's Today Show as well as The Rosie O'Donnell Show to reassure parents he hadn't died of a heroin overdose and let kids know all was A-OK with their problem-solving pal. In reality, Steve passed along his Handy Dandy Notebook to Joe so he could pursue a career in music. He released his first album, Songs for Dustmites, shortly after his Blue's Clues departure. He went on to collaborate with several artists from The Flaming Lips and later started a band, Steve Burns and the Struggle. His second album was released in 2009. The now 42-year-old entertainer has acted in a handful of indie films and smaller projects since his Blue's Clues days. He lives in Brooklyn these days and is quite a social media presence. He regularly jokes about the seemingly never-ending rumors of his early demise on Twitter, too. Steve's certainly branched out of the typical kid show host mold, but he's grateful to have been a part of Blue's Clues. ""I don't think [being on the show] has caused any sort of credibility deficit,"" he once said on the Today Show. ""I think it's an amazing children's television show...I'm incredibly proud to have been even involved in it. I think coming from kids TV, it just makes the story more interesting."" Agreed. Now where's the mail?","lives in Brooklyn these days and is quite a social media presence. He regularly jokes about the seemingly never-ending rumors of his early demise on Twitter, too."
3048,"Whether we like wearing yoga pants and a t-shirt or dresses every day, sometimes our style doesn't always line up with what our significant other likes to see us in. I set out on a mission to see what my boyfriend of two years really likes me wearing and this is what I found out about his preferences, style and our relationship. The only two rules were I couldn't change the outfit he picked and I couldn't let him know what I thought about it. I set out on a very eye-opening mission. As a girl who rarely dresses up, except for work or a special occasion, my boyfriend has come to learn that it's a miracle if I'm caught wearing a dress with booties and my hair down. I Let My Boyfriend Pick Out My Outfits For An Entire Week. But he learned from very early on that loving me meant loving my minimal makeup, hair in a bun, yoga pants and t-shirt look. Despite my signature look, I decided I wanted to learn what he actually liked me wearing. Day One: We Started This Journey On Super Bowl Sunday. Luckily, since he had no preference in either team this year, my wardrobe was not decked out in Bronco orange or Panther blue. He picked out yoga pants, a jersey shirt (which he bought me in Minnesota) and Nike high tops, which I hadn't dug out of my closet in years. I Learned He Matches Clothes Better Than I Do. Needless to say he sure doesn't mind the yoga pants that I'm always wearing and he seems to like me wearing things he buys. And, for a guy, he has great matching skills. Day Two: The Journey Continued Through The Work Week. Again for my Monday attire, he picked leggings and shoes I haven't worn in years. Is he trying to tell me something here? Maybe we're getting at something. Day Three: He Even Got Inspiration For My Looks. The inspiration for this look came from ""Grease"" (maybe because we had watched it earlier that weekend.) Again a piece of clothing I haven't worn in years, my leather jacket, yoga pants and black wedge booties. I'm seeing a theme now. Day Four: Another Day, Another Sweater. I guess it is sweater weather, but I'm pretty sure I used up all of mine during this experimental week. So he likes the bundled up and comfy look? Sounds good to me! But Sometimes, He Was Just Cruel. A bunch of snow on the ground? Sure, let's make her wear wedged boots. Sounds like a fabulous idea. Ugh, guys just don't understand the struggle some shoes cause, especially in the snow! Day Five: Another Inspirational Look Came On Thursday. This look he called ""Tabby Thursday"" or in other words, ""How To Dress Like A Cat Lady: 101."" He switched it up and chose jeans and paired them with my cat shirt and cat Vans. He's definitely not ashamed of my love for cats. The Cat Lady Wardrobe. I dodged a bullet on this day though, because he almost put me in jeans and a denim shirt. There's no way I could pull that off. The fashion gods were sure looking out for me. Day Six: His Methods Were Even Better Than Mine. When it came to picking out my outfit, he would lay everything out on the bed to see if it look good together. He would even stick the pants in the shoes to make sure the outfit matched. Now that's dedication. It's Sweater Weather. If I learn nothing else from this experience besides one thing, it would be that he likes me in sweaters, yoga pants and boots (in the winter, that is.) And I'm definitely not complaining. Day Seven: Our Journey Came To An Early End. Day seven rolled around and he gave up. I mean he threw in the towel, waved his white flag and forfeited. Despite being better at matching and picking out clothes than I am, he said he hated choosing my outfits since I had nothing cute to wear. Shopping spree? A Few Lessons Learned. At least I learned a few things from this journey, despite its abrupt end. The most important lesson? He'd rather be eating, playing video games, working out or doing absolutely anything else besides worrying about what I am wearing. ","Day seven rolled around and he gave up.

The music is something of a pre-race ritual for Phelps, in addition to cupping. ""I have walked out to race with my headphones on throughout my whole career and listen to music until the last possible moment,"" he told the Guardian in 2005, just after winning six gold medals in the Athens Olympics. ""It helps me to relax and get into my own little world."" The routine seems to work pretty well. Phelps and his team won the relay, earning him his 19th gold medal – but it certainly received a lot of attention. Some worried the swimmer would accidentally jump in with his headphones on. Many coveted a warm-up playlist from the most decorated Olympian – sometimes with their own speculation. Kate Caratenuto (@khcara) Very curious as to what Michael Phelps is listening to in those headphones. Is it Bruce Springsteen? Queen? The Shrek soundtrack? Lmk Sara Benincasa (@SaraJBenincasa) What is #MichaelPhelps hype music? Tim Federle (@TimFederle) Every time I see Michael Phelps in those big Beats headphones I think: Which ""Les Miz"" recording is he listening to?? Phelps hasn’t revealed his playlist this year – though the New York Times wrote that it is a mix of Eminem, Young Jeezy and the country singer Eric Church. He told the Guardian back in 2005 that he likes Eminem, Dr Dre and Notorious BIG. He had even gone to a Snoop Dogg concert in that year and met the rapper the Game backstage. ""I didn’t get to meet Snoop. He doesn’t ‘meet’ people,"" Phelps said. Rolling Stone published a few of Phelps’ warm-up jams in 2012. His ""solid gold hits"" included I’m Me and Right Above It by Lil Wayne – ""That song made me want to finish strong and look forward to life after swimming"" – No Beef by Afrojack and Steve Aoki, Levels by Avicii and Go Getta by Young Jeezy. Phelps and the rest of the USA swimming team did their own take on James Corden’s popular carpool karaoke segment ahead of the games – though it’s unclear if they used his personal playlist. With Phelps at the wheel, he sang along to Chicken Fried by Zac Brown Band. Even a phone call from his mom couldn’t interrupt Phelps from jamming out. During the race in Rio, Phelps sported Beats headphones – a departure from his previous brand of choice, Sol Republic. After he wore Sol headphones at the 2012 Games, the brand came out with a line of Phelps-inspired headphones. In a video from Sol Republic, the swimmer said his first cassette was Green Day and he likes to listen to hip-hop in the morning and techno before workouts. With both sets of headphones, Phelps had to cover the logos with tape for the cameras. Phelps’ son was seen emulating dad at the race on Sunday.

You hear the mom swearing, we’re fearing the worst, then we hear a little voice repeat what her mother said then ask, ""What happened?"" Luckily no one was injured in this crash. We’re not writing this to shame the mother, we’re thankful she and her little ones were saved. But it’s scenarios like this we often overlook and don’t think twice about. It’s one thing if someone else is taking the video, but please do not be the person driving and filming at the same time. Cell phones aren’t going away, and the statistics are scary when you look up how many crashes are caused by distracted drivers. In 2014, 3,179 people were killed, and 431,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers.","Cell phones aren’t going away, and the statistics are scary when you look up how many crashes are caused by distracted drivers"
3060,"Ever wonder what those floaty things in your eyes are? Well, the folks at TED-Ed have an explanation, broken down into understandable terms that anyone — and not just those with biology degrees — can understand. First things first, floaters (scientific name: Muscae volitantes) aren't typically a cause for concern. Floaters only exist in your eyeball, not in the external world. And though they appear to wander in the direction that your eye does, they aren't alive by any means. So what are they? Inside your eyeball, there is a gel known as vitreous humour. Over time, the constituents of the vitreous humour break down and drift away, hence the name ""floaters."" According to TED-Ed, floaters may be bits of protein or tissue, or perhaps red blood cells. These fragments ""cast shadows on the retina,"" and thus, when they're closer to the retina, the stronger the shadow will be. According to All About Vision , floaters will appear more defined when you're looking at a bright backdrop, like a blue sky or a computer screen. In the TED-Ed video, they also discuss the blue field entoptic phenomenon. Ever look at the sky and start to see small dots in your vision? Those small, darting dots are the result of white blood cells moving around the capillaries. Though this phenomenon is unrelated to floaters, it's equally fascinating.","bits of protein or tissue, or perhaps red blood cells"
3063,"Flickr Having a one-inch penis might seem like a nightmare to most men, however for JF (not his real name obviously) that nightmare is a reality. A sexual experience 12-years-ago left JF so scarred that he’s been afraid to seek love since – leading him to write a column in Cosmopolitan calling for people to be more sensitive towards micro-penises. JF’s penis is ‘approximately 1 inch long when flaccid and 2.7 inches long when fully erect’ while also being ‘very thin’. Writing in Cosmopolitan the bearer of this micropenis said: When flaccid, you might say it resembles two raisins flat on top of each other. As it extends erect, I would guess that in length and girth, it would be the equivalent in volume of two cocktail sausages. According to the article, several studies suggest that the average penis in America is around 2.8–3.9 inches flaccid and around 4.7–6.3 inches when erect. Writing about his only sexual encounter, an encounter where he was repeatedly asked ‘is it in?’, he said: I am 35 and have had just one sexual experience (through personal choice), which was humiliating, to say the least. It was more than 12 years ago with a very attractive university student. When I stripped, she stared at my micropenis, giggled, and put her hand to her mouth, muttering simply ""OK"" in a tone that suggested she was taken aback. When it came to actually performing, first I found that the condom wouldn’t stay on, but more frustratingly, my micropenis kept falling out every time I tried to penetrate her. Even when I was inside her, she kept asking me, ""Is it in?"" Every time she asked me that, I wanted to die. It was clear that she was getting nothing out of the experience. I genuinely tried my best to make her happy via oral sex, but she didn’t orgasm or enjoy that either. When at last I finally thought I was making her content, she suddenly huffed in an annoyed way and got up, saying she needed a glass of water. And that was the end of it. Oh dear. Poor JF. JF went onto explain how ashamed of his penis he is, and with shows like Naked Attraction, where men and women will choose somebody to date based on their physical assets, he believes people are too judgemental of them. He added: In the season finale, six guys were lined up in front of a stunningly beautiful woman who seemed to have a nice personality. Before selecting a date, the female presenter asked her if penis size was important, to which she replied: ""Yes. I’ve been in a situation before where a guy treated me like an absolute princess and then when it came down to it, he had the tiniest penis."" As a guy with a micropenis, watching what looked like such an amazing woman say that sliced through my soul. It made me feel totally worthless, and I can’t imagine what that guy she was referring to must have felt like. She was only being honest, but the message was clear: We are not good enough for you. He’s got a good point – hopefully he’ll get over his bad experience and find someone who will appreciate him for what he is.","Writing about his only sexual encounter, an encounter where he was repeatedly asked ‘is it in?’"
3064,"The Detroit home where Eminem spent part of his childhood burned in a blaze Thursday, just days after a woman reportedly offered to purchase it and turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper. Firefighters responded to battle the fire at the small, two-story bungalow just south of 8 Mile Road at 6:20 p.m., the Detroit Free Press reports. The boarded-up home was on a street with numerous other vacant homes and overgrown yards. According to the Associated Press, an immediate cause wasn't known for the fire that damaged the top floor of the house. A Detroit Free Press video shows some of the aftermath: The house will look familiar to fans of the Detroit MC. It appears on the cover of Eminem's 2000 release ""The Marshall Mathers LP,"" and makes a comeback on the cover of ""The Marshall Mathers LP 2,"" released this week. The vacant house has been up for auction through the Michigan Land Bank for months with an apparent minimum bid of $1. But just Monday, MLive reported a Tennessee woman was in the process of bidding on the home, though her offer had not yet been accepted by the Michigan Land Bank. The news site describes 28-year-old Shelly Hazlett as an ""avid Eminem fan"" who wanted to turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper. Before falling into disrepair, the home belonged to Eminem's mother for several years, according to records obtained by the Detroit Free Press. In her book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, Deborah Mathers spoke fondly of the house at 19946 Dresden St. ""Marshall loved it so much that he had a model of it made to take on tour with him,"" she wrote. ""Even though we'd moved a lot, he always said the house on Dresden was his childhood home."" You can see Eminem walking on a dark street past the boarded-up house at the end of his video for ""Survival,"" starting at minute 4:06. It's hard to read the stone-faced rapper's expression, but some might say he almost looks wistful.","The Detroit home where Eminem spent part of his childhood burned in a blaze Thursday, just days after a woman reportedly offered to purchase it and turn it into a museum dedicated to the rapper"

A new study conducted by Oakland University psychologists Justin K. Mogilski and Lisa L.M. Welling suggests lovers who exhibit signs of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism are less willing to let go of exes after breakups. Mogilski and Welling explored the alleged friendships of 861 exes. Along with answering questions about how they got along with their former flames post-breakups, participants filled out surveys intended to measure the prevalence of dark personality traits, like self-admiration, insensitivity and manipulation. The study discovered participants who exhibited more traits of a psychopath were also more likely to keep exes in their lives as ""friends."" As if that weren't enough, their reasons for staying in touch weren't so much sentimental as they were pragmatic and self-serving (sexual access, established loyalty, etc.).

3070,"All of us have used a computer at one point of time or seen someone using a laptop at work or a coffee shop. Some of you might have had a 13 inch laptop for gaming or you might have just had a cheap one to get you through college. You might be fascinated by the moving parts that are assembled in that small case that acts as a truly portable computer, but you got to charge the laptop using the charging cable that it came with and you might have noticed a small cylinder at the end of the cable. You might have not thought of it as something big, but in fact it plays a big role in keeping your laptop working in perfect condition. Find out more in the following article. Laptop or your portable computer that you carry everywhere! A personal computer came into existence in the year 1971. It was a computer that people could afford to buy to be kept in their homes. Soon as the PCs got more famous, people thought of building computers that you could take with you and use wherever you like. The first famous and most commonly used modern laptop was IBM N40 laptop in 1994. With the advent of Microsoft’s Windows operating system, laptops became a rage and since then, everyone has used a laptop now and then. But have you ever thought of the components that complete your laptop? You might have seen a small cylinder on the laptop charging cable that came with the laptop. You must have wondered why the cylinder is there and what is its purpose? How the laptop parts vibrate and resonate? You laptop is made up of many moving parts like the hard disk drive and CD drive that create vibrations as they move and do their work. The laptop comes with a battery that needs to be charged for when you want to use it where there is no power supply. The charging cable has a cylinder near the end of it and it is the most interesting part of the computer. The cylinder is known as a ferrite bead. The moving parts of the laptop can vibrate and produce radio frequencies. These radio frequencies can interfere with things like Wi-Fi router of your home, the dish connection and other things. Though the laptop case dulls those vibrations and keeps them from causing any interference, but the charging cord is something that aids in spreading those vibrations. How the small cylinder stops the vibrations? The charging cable acts as an antennae and broadcasts the vibrations as radio frequencies and even pick up other frequencies and cause interference. Your Wi-Fi may act wildly if these signals compete at the same frequency at which your Wi-Fi works. Here the cylinder comes into the play on the charging cable. The cylinder has Ferrite, which is an alloy of Iron oxide or rust. This ferrite bead kills those signals that the charging cable broadcasts or catches. It is a simple and cost effective way of keeping your laptop from interfering with other electronic devices in your home. So, here you go, the cylinder actually helps you to work without facing any issues. All the laptop users should collectively thank all the laptop manufacturers for taking care of everything so that we don’t face any problems while we work.","The cylinder has Ferrite, which is an alloy of Iron oxide or rust.

3072,"""The hair will become a lot stronger, shinier and healthier""  Whilst some of us do it more often than others, we all have to wash our hair. And you'd be forgiven for thinking there’s not much to it. Wet hair, lather up shampoo, rinse off and out you pop, right?  Apparently not. Smooth waves by Olivia this morning, keeping the week glam @megansophiee @elite_london #thelionandthefox #smoothwaves #glamhair A post shared by The Lion & The Fox (@tlandtf) on Apr 20, 2016 at 9:52am PDT According to top hairstylist Ian Florey, we’re washing our hair all wrong - it’s critical to wash it twice, he says. Whilst many people presume the ‘lather, rinse, repeat’ instructions on shampoos is just a way to get you to use more of the product, Florey waxes lyrical about the benefits of doing so. ""Wet the hair, then wash it twice with a non-sulphate shampoo. The first shouldn’t create much lather but the second one will give a lot more,"" he explains to The Independent. Florey says it’s essential to shampoo twice, rinsing in between, and your hair will be transformed if you do. ""The hair will become a lot stronger, shinier and healthier,"" he says, but adds that the improvement won’t be instantaneous and it could take a few weeks or even months for the change to take effect.   The reason you need to shampoo twice is that the first wash removes all the dirt (and thanks to pollution, dry shampoo and styling products, there can be an awful lot built up), and so you need to wash it again for any of the nourishing properties of the shampoo to get to work.

What’s more, you only need a dollop of shampoo the size of a 20p coin - provided you’re using shampoo of a good enough quality which should lather up easily.  Florey has over thirty years’ experience in the world of hairdressing, has worked on designer fashion shows including Julian McDonald, Erdem and Roksander Ilincic, and now works at the trendy hair salon-cum-art gallery The Lion and the Fox in Clerkenwell, London.  He explains that a lot of people aren’t conditioning their hair correctly either - you should only apply conditioner from the mid-lengths of the hair downwards because otherwise it will make the roots flyaway and flat. The most important step, however, is to comb through the conditioner after applying it. Don’t use a brush, but a wide-toothed comb or a tangle-teaser.  ""Make sure to towel-dry the hair first or at least squeeze the moisture out to ensure the conditioner isn’t diluted and goes on in concentrated form,"" Florey explains. Then, starting from the roots and working upwards, gently comb the hair to get all the knots out and ensure the product is evenly distributed through the hair. Hair is a lot more prone to breakage when wet so it’s critical not to be aggressive. ""You only need a dollop of conditioner the size of a 10p or 50p coin if your hair is long,"" Florey adds.","According to top hairstylist Ian Florey, we’re washing our hair all wrong - it’s critical to wash it twice"

Sleep allows us to wind our bodies down after a hectic, long day. There are many ways to ensure you are getting the best sleep like going to bed at the exact time every night, maintaining the bedroom in a cool temperature setting, and turning off the lights completely. But there is one thing that may be hurting you when you are in dream land and you don't even know. Your sleep position may actually be negatively impacting your overall health and it's relying on one side that is the most damaging. The good news is that you can train your body to move to the correct side. You will be glad you did. People who sleep on the right side of their bodies are causing long term damage. Studies have shown that sleeping on the right side helps the stomach's gastric acid travel to the esophagus. Over time, this increases the risk of developing esophageal and stomach cancer. Switching to your left side will improve your health. The left side of your body is considered the ""dominant weak side."" Sleeping on the left gives the body the opportunity to filter out the toxins, lymph fluid, and waste. This is done through the lymph nodes and thoracic duct. Monica H. Digestion gets extra help when you choose the correct side. Waste moves from the large intestine to the colon partly due to gravity when you turn to the left.

3083,"It was only fitting that Graham Allgood received his summer internship offer from Horizon Media via Snapchat. After all, that's how he attracted their attention in the first place.

He'd been looking for an internship since Christmas, only to find his emails unreturned or résumé shoved into piles. ""Honestly my story to find a summer internship is fairly familiar with lots of other college students.

That's when he decided to do something different to stand out from the crowd. He turned to Snapchat and designed his own geofilter to run an advertising campaign to promote himself as a great hire to the employees of Horizon Media, the largest stand-alone ad agency in the US. Geofilters on Snapchat target a specific location and can be overlaid on a photo. In Allgood's case, he designed the Horizon name to appear alongside his at the bottom of the screen with a small ""Hey Hire Me"" square at the top. He knew that the company posted photos and videos from inside the office on Tuesdays, so he spent $30 to target the company. And it definitely caught the company's attention.

3090,"Rio de Janeiro It didn’t take long for the Brazilians to rewrite the norms of Olympic fandom. The list of Olympic participants targeted by Brazilian boos is long and varied: Russians, due to its doping scandal; Spaniards, as symbols of Latin American colonialism; a tennis ball boy who had butterfingers; favorites—like the poor Romanian women’s handball team—when they played the underdogs; and, of course, anyone from Brazil’s historic rival Argentina, who probably get the worst of it. Pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie was booed by the Rio fans—twice in 24 hours—to the point he was in floods of tears on the podium, leading the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach to take the unprecedented step of saying the crowd’s antics were ""unacceptable at the Olympics."" Pole-vaulter Renaud Lavillenie consoled by Thiago Braz and Sergei Bubka after he was booed at medal ceremony pic.twitter.com/BrMoF3KGA0 — IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) August 17, 2016 The fans were so boisterous at a beach volleyball game between the Brazilian and Czech teams that the public address announcer had to repeatedly admonish them against booing the visitors (link in Portuguese). A normally staid air-pistol event almost turned into a melee when unruly Brazilian fans tried rattling the concentration of foreigners as they pulled the trigger (link in Portuguese). At a tennis match where fans heckled the player from Argentina, there was a scuffle in the stands (link in Spanish)—perhaps the first ever case of tennis hooliganism. In London four years ago, the British fans got behind not only their own country, but every other in the spirit of sportsmanship. Alberto Murray Neto, a Brazilian lawyer who has served in the past on the Brazilian Olympic Committee, says that as Brazilian soccer dominated the sporting culture here, mastering the codes of other sports will be a learning process for many people who have never seen them played. ""This is the Brazilian way, which is different from the very proper English way in 2012,"" he says. At the Riocentro sports complex on Friday night (Aug. 12), the fans were as much the talk of foreign tourists and athletes as the Games themselves. Marian Busch, a German tourist, said Brazilians are wonderful people—as long as you don’t run into them in the bleachers. ""They do things that would be considered unfair and unsporting in Europe,"" she says. While the weightlifters were pictures of concentration as they crouched over their bars, the low roar from the stands never diminished. The seemingly oblivious Brazilian rooters were shooting selfies, gobbling up concession stand snacks and engaging unashamedly in public displays of affection. At one point, when the noise seemed to be distracting a Ukrainian lifter, a group of Ukrainian fans, who looked as pumped up as some of the participants, brusquely told some nearby Brazilians to knock it off. Russian gymnast Alexei Nemov tries to calm the crowd down. (Reuters) In another arena, Australia and Malaysia were doing battle in badminton. For reasons that weren’t clear, a large contingent of Brazilians had adopted the Australian cause that night—more loudly than the Aussies themselves. Sometimes, the fans just seemed to make noise for its own sake. At one point during a ping-pong event, a cheer went up incongruously in the middle of a long volley. It turned out fans were applauding a slender fellow in a track suit who happened to be sauntering past the bleachers. ‘Need to vent’ Olympic organizers have already asked the crowd to rein it in. ""We’ll ask the fans for more silence and elegance during the competitions,"" Rio Olympics spokesman Mario Andrada said last week. ""The passion of the Brazilian fans pleases us all, but it’s necessary to respect the adversary. The Olympics aren’t fútbol games."" Besides the tradition of soccer, the unruly behavior may have something to do with the hard times Brazilians are currently enduring, sports sociologist Mauricio Murad told Quartz. With Brazil’s president facing impeachment while the country endures its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the scream coming from the bleachers is a primal one, Murad says. ""Brazilians need to vent right now, and I think that’s what we’re seeing in the stands at the Olympics,"" he said. The bad behavior in the bleachers is also a consequence of Brazilians’ relatively limited interaction with the rest of the world historically, said Ronaldo Lemos, director of the Institute for Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro. ""The issue here is that Brazil is basically a very closed and insular country,"" he said. ""Brazilians do not live on a day-to-day basis with international people."" Having not traveled very much, he added, Brazilians may believe that their own manners are ""universal."" That is, this is how everyone behaves. Columnist Marcos Sergio Silva wrote that the conduct of fans also reflects the tendency of Brazilians to turn every event into a morality play along the lines of a telenovela, or soap opera. ""At bottom, we’re Manichean in the extreme and we always need to select villains,"" he wrote (link in Portuguese). The German tennis player Dustin Brown, who was getting booed while competing against Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, actually seemed to relish the villain’s role, egging the hostile crowd on. Chinese table tennis player Zhang Jike put his index finger to his lips to quiet the fans (link in Portuguese). Of course, that only made the jeering worse.","""This is the Brazilian way, which is different from the very proper English way in 2012,"""

Her incredible voice and one of a kind storytelling ability helped her win over the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Thanks to her popularity and tremendous career success, Adele managed to amass a net worth of more than $125 million. If you couldn’t guess, that kind of money can get you pretty much anything, including – of course – a pizza from a pizzaria more than 70 miles away. Yup, the 28 year old sent a resort employee on a 140 mile round trip for a slice of ‘za, and to make matters worse, she didn’t even end up eating it. Before you start judging, let’s back track and hear the full story. Adele is widely known as one of the most down-to-earth entertainers in the industry, but even she is seemingly capable of occasionally acting like a total diva. When the superstar was vacationing at a luxury country estate with her partner and 3-year-old son, she apparently had a craving for some pizza. The resort the couple were staying at had a number of on-call chefs, all of whom are capable of preparing a pizza. In fact, a source told Daily Mail that the resort is equipped with some of the best pizza ovens that money can buy, but Adele wasn’t having any of it. She insisted that a member of the resort staff drive to her favourite restaurant in Kensington, to pick up some pizza there. The Soho Farmhouse has a policy of saying ""yes"" to pretty much every whim of their guests, and Adele made sure to take advantage of the fact. It was 11pm when the singer ordered her take out, and by the time the driver made the trip out to London and back, she and her partner were fast asleep. A roomservice team member pointed out that the pizza was still in its box when the room was cleaned in the morning – rendering the entire late-night trip useless for resort staff. Tabloids all over the world picked up on this story and made quite a big fuss about it, seemingly forgetting that Adele isn’t just a regular person. She is a superstar singer and a multimillionaire, so ordering a pizza from a different city isn’t that big of a deal. After all, the employees were paid for their time. Also, pizza is a rare treat for Adele these days. After returning to the limelight with the release of her third album, it became obvious that the superstar lost some significant weight. In fact, Adele revealed that she follows a strict diet regimen, and a custom workout program – despite hating spending time at the gym.","Adele is widely known as one of the most down-to-earth entertainers in the industry, but even she is seemingly capable of occasionally acting like a total diva."
3093,"If you like your crime shows bleak, British and full of David Tennant snapping grumpily at people, then you need to start watching Broadchurch. The ITV drama — which was insanely popular in Britain when the first season was broadcast back in 2013 — has just gotten stuck into its third season. At the time of writing, we're three episodes in. Every time a new season of Broadchurch starts, I become achingly obsessed with it. The characters are great, the acting is flawless, and there's always a messy central mystery that keeps you guessing until the very last minute. If you're already watching it, great. If you've yet to give it a try or you've never even heard of it, let me try and convince you why it's worth a go. As you've probably gathered from that Season 1 trailer, it's not exactly a laugh a minute. But it is addictive viewing. The first season revolved around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a small, seaside town in Britain, and the resulting investigation. The second season was half courtroom drama, half new mystery. The third is about a rape. I don't want to say too much more in terms of plot, because I don't want to give anything away — but it's safe to say that there isn't any one central character (pretty much the whole town is woven into the story), and many of the same people crop up again and again. In that sense, Broadchurch almost has distant echoes of David Lynch or Stephen King: the drama is as much about the core mystery as it is about exposing the dark underbelly of a small, seemingly idyllic town. Broadchurch is one of those rare shows that manages to take an excellent story and execute it almost flawlessly. The first season in particular is perfect television: it's well shot, the characters are real and interesting, and the story marches towards its grim conclusion with a mounting tension that makes it very difficult to stop watching (I still remember the torturous, week-long wait between episodes back when I was watching Season 1 on TV). In my opinion at least, Season 2 is a bit of a mis-step. It's still very watchable and tense, but the court-room action coupled with the resurfacing an old mystery becomes slightly cluttered. Season 3, however, feels like a return to form. There's a new mystery, a selection of new characters, and so far the same old mounting tension that made the first season so damn addictive. Forget Sherlock and Watson, Poirot and Hastings, or Doctor Who and whoever his current sidekick is — it's all about Detectives Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller. Seriously though, they're great. Tennant and Colman are both ridiculously good actors, and their on-screen relationship develops brilliantly over the course of the show. Tennant nails Hardy's grumpy, anti-sociable irascibility, and Colman flawlessly covers pretty much every human emotion under the sun (her character has a pretty harrowing time of it, especially in the first two seasons). They bounce off each other well, too, and their squabbly dynamic adds an occasional, much-needed touch of humour to the show's otherwise near-constant bleakness. In a show with so much drama and emotion, a cast of strong actors is crucial. Luckily, everyone in Broadchurch is great. There are no weak links, and some of the actors — particularly the bereaved father Mark Latimer (Andrew Buchan) and Colman, who I genuinely think is one of the best actors in the world — put in such good performances that they stay with you long after the credits have rolled. Season 3 introduces a bunch of new characters into the mix. It's still early days — three episodes in and some of the characters have had little more than a shady introduction — but so far, things are looking good. If you've never seen any of it, now is the perfect time to begin some serious binge-watching. There are only eight episodes per series, after all, so if you start right this very minute you should be ready in time for episode 4 on Monday. If you're in the UK, Broadchurch Season 3 is currently available to stream on ITV Hub. Seasons 1-2 are available to stream on NOW TV. Season 3 of Broadchurch is currently showing on BBC America, and Season 1-2 are available to stream on Netflix.","If you like your crime shows bleak, British and full of David Tennant snapping grumpily at people,"

This 18-year-old, however, may not be so grateful for what his father did after hearing about his little vaping habit. Talk about tough love Tough love can go a long way, but sometimes it isn’t always the answer. An 18-year-old boy, who has remained anonymous, recently posted on Reddit explaining the god-awful tactics his father used to teach him a lesson. While his mom was cleaning his room, she found his E-cig pen and gave it to the boy’s father to destroy it. This father had a better plan than, though. Rather than smashing the vape, the boy’s father took one step further by actually urinating in his son’s E-cig juice and then casually placed it back in the cupboard for his son to find. But wait, it gets better... Help, please? Something is not right The best part about this story of trickery is that the boy had posted to Reddit about a week earlier with the subject being: ""Help please? I just got a new tank after my old one leaked and now something is not right."" He then explained that when he went to get his E-cig juice for his vaporizer and noticed that the juice ""just sat there,"" and ""looked more liquidy than normal."" If this doesn’t pose a red flag for the kid, then I don’t know what will. Maybe what finally got him was the fact that his juice tasted like ""a mix or dog piss and grape."" The boy also said, ""I tried again and again, gagging at the taste but to no avail. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"" Yeah kid, I’ll tell you what’s going on. Your dad is a total jerk and peed in your E-cig juice. I mean, I agree that nicotine is bad for you, and the father may have been trying to teach his son a ""lesson,"" but no parent should ever have to go that far. Come on, man, that’s just gross. This dad is pissed The boy went back and forth in a text message argument with his father, finally figuring out what his dad had done. He even tried to make his dad feel bad for it but unfortunately, his dad was clearly pleased with his work and his methods of parenting.

3096,"Google's new messenger app is stirring up a debate about whether companies should make strong encryption a default feature for users. (Reuters) Google this week announced a new messaging app with strong encryption, meaning that your communications can’t be wiretapped. But there’s a catch: You have to turn on that feature yourself. The tech titan’s plan to launch Allo this summer without encryption by default has drawn withering criticism from some quarters. Google's decision to disable end-to-end encryption by default in its new #Allo chat app is dangerous, and makes it unsafe. Avoid it for now. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) May 19, 2016 But other privacy advocates are more positive. ""I, too, would prefer that Allo be encrypted by default,"" said Kevin Bankston, director of New America’s Open Technology Institute. But, he added, ""all in all, this is going to be a net increase in the amount of encrypted messaging out in the world. And that is ultimately a good thing."" With Allo’s debut, Google is taking a step toward joining the growing number of tech firms embracing ""end-to-end"" encryption, which protects the privacy of text messages and voice and video calls in such a way that even with a warrant, the government can’t access them. But by requiring users to turn on the feature, Google is lowering the odds that average users will avail themselves of the option, critics such as Snowden say. Apple’s iMessage launched in 2011 with strong default encryption. WhatsApp, Facebook’s messaging app, last month announced it had full, end-to-end encryption by default on all platforms — including Android, iPhone and ­BlackBerry. Apple also launched its video call FaceTime feature in 2010 with default strong encryption. That means that even when served with a warrant, these firms cannot provide law enforcement access to WhatsApp and iMessage chats. FBI Director James B. Comey has endorsed the benefits of encryption. ""I love strong encryption,"" he said in a speech last month. But, he said, ""what’s changed in the last few years is that it’s now become the default, covering wide swaths of our lives and covering wide swaths of law enforcement’s responsibilities."" He has called for a balancing of privacy and public safety needs in which firms maintain a way — usually with a key — to get the government access to the communications it seeks. So Google’s move on balance is welcome, said one law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the issue on the record. ""Having this as an opt-in feature is certainly useful to us."" Google designed Allo without default encryption to make it easier to mesh the chat app with Google Assistant, a new conversation bot that can hold natural-sounding discussions with users, a Google spokesman said. It’s a competitor to Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and the many bots created for Facebook’s Messenger app. Assistant is designed to tap into Google’s wealth of data about users to provide tailored recommendations, from the best movies to see to the quickest route to the theater. Because Google may need to run queries made of Assistant on its own servers, the official said, it’s not feasible to offer end-to-end encryption by default. Users who opt to use the encrypted ""Incognito"" mode may thus lack some Assistant features, he said. Some tech experts said it is possible to combine strong encryption with the artificial intelligence bot feature. ""There’s always a way,"" said Morey Haber, vice president of technology at the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust. Smartphones, for example, could do some of the processing on the device. But, he said, it would be difficult to fully process queries to Assistant without the power of Google’s remote servers, which would need to see the unencrypted queries. ""I don’t think the technology is there yet,"" Haber said. The company said that even the standard chat mode conforms with standard encryption practices; messages between Google and users will be encrypted, but the Google Assistant system will have access to what users are sending. Still, the company’s decision to forgo default encryption has raised questions — even internally. A Google engineer wrote in A Google engineer wrote in a personal blog post Thursday obliquely criticized the lack of default encryption. ""If incognito mode with end-to-end encryption ... is so useful, why isn’t it the default in Allo?"" Thai Duong wrote. He also said he would push for ""a setting where users can opt out of cleartext [unencrypted] messaging."" Both lines were quietly removed later that evening from his post, with Duong adding a note that he erased a paragraph ""because it’s not cool to publicly discuss or to speculate the intent or future plans for the features of my employer’s products."" Google declined to comment on whether it pressured Duong to edit his post. Christopher Soghoian, American Civil Liberties Union principal technologist, said by making the encryption feature an opt-in, ""Google gets the maximum press value out of the encryption tech while guaranteeing that it is used by as few people as possible."" Google, he said, ""has given the FBI exactly what top officials have been asking for."" Bankston said the opt-in will depend on how easy the firm makes it to do so. ""That,"" he said, ""will turn a lot on the design.""",The tech titan’s plan to launch Allo this summer without encryption by default

3101,"While water comes with a bevy of health benefits, it shouldn't be had immediately after meals. It can hamper your digestion process, spiking insulin levels. There has been a lot of debate on the time and amount of water you should be having before, with and after meals. A lot of people have the habit of downing umpteen glasses of water along with their meals, perhaps with the intention of washing down the food and hoping that this aids the digestive process. However, nutritionists across the world dismiss the idea strongly. Various studies show that the practice severely hampers digestion by diluting the essential gastric juices and causes an upsurge in insulin levels. The issue here is three-fold: consuming water before meals, consuming water alongside meals, and consuming water after meals. Renowned nutritionist Dr. Anju Sood says, ""It roughly takes two hours to digest what you eat. The food goes through your esophagus to the stomach, then to your colon before being flushed out of your system. There is a certain fluid-solid proportion in our gastric system. If you consume water before the meals, you are not only disturbing the fluid component by diluting what you eat, you are also fastening the digestion process as the food now enters the large intestine much sooner than it should. Hence it is not advisable to have water just before your meal."" She also strongly dismisses the idea of having water alongside meals, as it not only fastens digestion but also tampers the natural absorption of nutrients after digestion. ""Some people who drink water alongside meals have also shown a tendency to have an expanded colon,"" she said. Coming to the issue of drinking water right after your meals, Dr. Sood notes the ill effects, ""By drinking water right after your meals, you are again tampering the natural time it takes for your food to digest. This also makes you feel hungrier faster than anticipated and results in overeating and bloating."" She recommends a 30 minute window both before and after your meals. ""In these 30 minutes, your system proceeds to the next stage of digestion."" Studies suggest that it is essential to maintain some gap after your meals as this helps in absorption of essential nutrients too. Consuming water right after the meal tends to dilute gastric juice. Though, our stomach is adept at absorbing water, but an excess intake of water after meal dilutes enzymes that are essential for digestion. This is responded by lesser secretion of digestive enzymes that in turn can lead to heartburn and acidity. The hindered digestive process also leaves behind a lot of undigested food behind in the system. The glucose from this undigested food converts into fat and is stored in your body.  This process leads to the upsurge of insulin, which causes a rise in the blood sugar levels of the body, and can lead to diabetes and obesity. Therefore, while it is important to keep yourself hydrated and consume a minimum of two litres of water every day, you must also ensure you follow the right time to gulp down the wonder liquid.","It can hamper your digestion process, spiking insulin levels"

It's a miracle he even noticed it. What was inside the box broke his heart. You can barely see the box here. It blends in with the snow. Even close up, it just looks like a piece of garbage that might have blown in from the road. When he looked inside the box, he saw this depressing scene for the first time: a freezing kitten, shivering next to its frozen food. Behind the first kitten, another kitten huddled close to her brother. Keep in mind: this was out in the middle of nowhere. The kittens had been dumped there, all alone, to slowly die in the cold. He grabbed the box and was determined to help the kittens survive. The cat at the back of the box was sick, but not in as bad shape as her brother. The other cat was in a very bad way. It's likely he would not have survived much longer. The kittens were so traumatized that they were terrified to be without each other and would cry out when they were separated. The cats desperately needed medical attention, but, first, they needed to just make it through the night. Warm blankets helped to raise their body temperatures. They responded so well to their human rescuers; they purred like crazy whenever they were held. The healthier kitten would purr and nuzzle anyone who would let her. The other cat was still in terrible condition, but he did survive the night and made it to the vet as soon as possible. These kittens are well on the road to recovery! It is amazing that these kittens have been through so much and seen so much cruelty in their tiny lives. But it's equally miraculous that they are loving and trusting of their rescuers. What a great, happy ending for these two.","freezing kitten, shivering next to its frozen food"
3107,"CHICAGO -- It’s finally here, a day more than 108 years in the making. The Chicago Cubs usher in a new era Monday, when the team returns to Wrigley Field for the first time since Game 5 of the 2016 World Series. They won that one and two more in Cleveland to break the longest championship drought in professional sports history, and now every visitor to the historic stadium will be reminded of that fact. ""Rings are wonderful, but I love banner raising,"" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said over the weekend. ""That’s symbolically there all the time. Every time a kid shows up at the ballpark, he sees that banner. Hopefully, we’ll be able to see more."" The Cubs are off to a slightly slower start in 2017, but nothing will take away their magical season of a year ago. As the team on the field transformed, so did the ballpark they play in. It’s being upgraded over a five-year plan, which began with a new home clubhouse. In order to add more seats, the iconic bullpens along the right- and left-field foul lines have been moved beneath the bleachers. The lovable losers are now a money-making machine off the field and world champions on it. ""There is good and bad about it,"" reliever Justin Grimm said. ""No interaction with the fans, but I’ll be under the bleachers like a caged animal."" The increase in seats -- and ticket prices -- is the cost of winning. Beloved for so many years as losers, the Cubs are turning into the model franchise for sustained success. For ownership and the front office, it’s the culmination of a vision started when Tom Ricketts bought the team in 2009 and accelerated when Theo Epstein came on board a couple years later. World Series MVP Ben Zobrist is a native of Illinois and gets the significance Monday holds. ""It’s the dawn of a new era for the Chicago Cubs,"" he said. ""To be kind of in the middle of it and experience it is really special. That’s why I signed over here."" That's why Jon Lester, who is pitching Monday night, signed, along with John Lackey after him. That's why Maddon wanted to manage in Chicago: to be part of the team that broke the curse. The Cubs don’t get their rings until Wednesday, so the banner raising and unveiling of a new-look ballpark will be the main attractions in the home opener. ""It will be cool,"" Lester said. ""At first, I didn’t understand why they were doing the ring and banner on two different nights, but now I’m kind of glad. I can enjoy Wednesday without pitching. This hasn’t been done at Wrigley in a really long time. It will be fun to be a part of it."" Until now, the players have tried to keep their focus on 2017, but as any championship team will admit, when the banner goes up, memories from the season before return in spades. Maddon wants his team to embrace it, remember it -- even bottle it. Once you get a taste of winning, it is quenched only by doing it again. ""It’s really a special time, and I would encourage my guys to slow it down, take those mental snapshots, enjoy it,"" Maddon said. ""Don’t let it happen too quickly."" ""Understand this is good. We celebrate achievement. I am looking forward to it."" A whole city awaits, and the Cubs are used to the hoopla. ""It’s been a whirlwind since we won,"" shortstop Addison Russell said. ""Get to take home a gold jersey. That’s something you don’t get to tell your parents every day. And we’re ready to get those rings and then go get another one."" It’s the new normal at Wrigley Field. So is the new look of the ballpark. Although Maddon didn’t love the idea of the bullpens going under the bleachers, he and the players are willing to give it a chance. ""I will definitely miss being on the sidelines, but I can’t knock it too much,"" reliever Mike Montgomery said. ""There’ll be some better things about not being on the side, but after experiencing that last year [after being acquired last July], I really liked that. It’ll be hard to beat that. ""You get to be into the game. It’s a different vibe when you throw inside. It’s not going to be my favorite, but maybe I’ll end up liking it more."" Winning or losing won’t come down to where the bullpens are located; neither will the results of the previous season. Although the Cubs could be distracted from the task of beating the Los Angeles Dodgers this week, they’ll undoubtedly get a pass from their fans. No matter what happens moving forward, no one can take 2016 away. The magic of a 103-win season and a World Series victory takes center stage again Monday. It might not be the World Series, but it’s a tough ticket to find. ""There is something about that feeling in the air,"" Zobrist said. ""When you see the fans there, the electricity is amazing. I can’t wait. It’s my favorite park. It always has been, and it’s never more true than now.""","The Chicago Cubs usher in a new era Monday, when the team returns to Wrigley Field for the first time since Game 5 of the 2016 World Series."
3108,"At this late stage in the superhero game, it's clear that the various studios are intent on shaking up some of the older, more iconic characters. So when it was reported that Disney Channel pop star Zendaya had been cast as Mary Jane Watson in the upcoming Spider-Man: Homecoming, it should have come as no surprise. Yet it was an announcement that didn't set well with fans. Despite having already gone through this same thing with the Ghostbusters, Johnny Storm and Doctor Strange's The Ancient One. From the get-go, Sony and Marvel have stated that they are making this next Spider-Man reboot an all-inclusive affair, with a very diversified cast. Traditionally, Mary Jane Watson is portrayed as a white woman with red hair who is based on Ann-Margret from the movie Bye Bye Birdie. In the original Sam Raimi trilogy, she was played by Kirsten Dunst, who came under fire at the time for not being a natural red head. She was later portrayed by Shailene Woodley in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but her scenes were all cut and she was removed from the movie. Some speculated that online uproar from fans who hated seeing Woodley in the role is what got her canned. On the flip side, Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman, who is an actress, singer, and dancer, has an African-American father and a white mother. Some fans are upset that the dark haired beauty just doesn't fit the traditional Mary Jane template. The controversy stems from her race, but Shailene Woodley certainly got it way worse when she was cast as Mary Jane, and the first set photos emerged of her in character, which showed her as a motorcycle riding tomboy. So it's clear that Mary Jane is just one of those characters that is going to cause an uproar no matter who is cast in the role. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 director James Gunn certainly noticed the most recent controversy brewing. He's not shy when it comes to social media. So he decided to post his thoughts on this controversy on Facebook. He starts by saying this. ""People get upset when something they consider intrinsic to a comic book character changes when adapted for a film. I get this. There are movies I dislike because I think there's a basic misunderstanding of the story or the character when the comic is transferred to film (I still hate how in the first Batman movie the Joker was revealed as the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents, for instance.) That said, I do not believe a character is the color of his or her skin. When Michael B Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm I didn't understand the uproar. The primary characteristic of Johnny was not, to me, that he was white, or that he had blonde hair, but that he was a fiery, funny, big-mouthed braggart of a hero. I was happy that he was going to be played by one of the finest and most charming young actors out there."" Fair enough. Once people saw how bad Fantastic Four was, Michael B. Jordan was actually cited as one of the movie's bright spots. And once it was seen how the character was handled, most fans forgot there even was a controversy. But this type of fan outcry isn't always about race. Many believed Shailene Woodley wasn't sexy enough to play Mary Jane, and a whole lot of people thought having Ben Affleck suit up as Batman was a horrible idea. Those same people changed their tune once they saw what the Oscar winner was capable of delivering under that cape and cowl. James Gunn goes onto say this. ""Yesterday, a rumor broke out that the character of Mary Jane was being played by a young black woman, Zendaya, and all hell broke out on the Internet (again). I tweeted that if people find themselves complaining about Mary Jane's ethnicity they have lives that are too good. (For those of you who think this means I'm confirming that Zendaya IS playing MJ, realize that although I've read the Spidey script, and I've met the actress in question, I have no idea what her role is. There's a good chance someone told me at one time or another, but, if so, I can't remember. I'm going to find out when I go into Marvel this afternoon, but I feel free to speak until that time because it's about the concept about a black woman playing Mary Jane, not the actuality or hypothesis of it.) I got a thousand or so responses to my tweet. Most of them were positive. Some folks disagreed - they thought the character should look like what she looks like in the comics - but were thoughtful. And a handful were flat out racist."" The director does acknowledge that not everyone upset about Zendaya playing Mary Jane is a racist, that they simply don't want their favorite comic book characters changed. He goes onto address those particular fans, trying to calm them down with some insight. He says this. ""I can't respond to the racists - I'm not ever going to change their minds. But for the thoughtful majority of you out there: For me, if a character's primary attribute - the thing that makes them iconic - is the color of their skin, or their hair color, frankly, that character is shallow and sucks. For me, what makes MJ MJ is her alpha female playfulness, and if the actress captures that, then she'll work. And, for the record, I think Zendaya even matches what I think of as MJ's primary physical characteristics - she's a tall, thin model - much more so than actresses have in the past. Whatever the case, if we're going to continue to make movies based on the almost all white heroes and supporting characters from the comics of the last century, we're going to have to get used to them being more reflective of our diverse present world. Perhaps we can be open to the idea that, although someone may not initially match how we personally conceive a character, we can be - and often are - happily surprised."" As he states, Marvel and Sony have not yet confirmed that Zendaya is in fact playing Mary Jane Watson. There's a chance she's not. Which means this uproar is all for nothing. Over the course of Comic-Con, director Jon Watts announced that Zendaya was playing a character named Michelle. There are a lot of actors in Spider-Man: Homecoming, and the producers behind this rebirth of the franchise have tried to make it as diversified as possible, especially to reflect the type of realistic high school community that currently exists in New York. Chances are Zendaya is playing Mary Jane.

I love having some sliced in the fridge for whenever I need a cool-down snack for myself or friends. But after I slice it I do one very simple thing: I season the watermelon with salt. I know, I know, it might sound odd to sprinkle a watery fruit like melon with salt, but think about why the classic Italian pair of prosciutto and cantaloupe works so well; prosciutto is salty AF. A small sprinkle of salt doesn't just offer a salty-sweet kick, it also brings out the sweetness in the watermelon, making this the perfect hack for when you dig into a lackluster slice. Trust me, I've had people FREAK over this simple trick; it's a game-changer.",season the watermelon with salt
3110,"So you want to work in Japan? Great! I thought the same thing about eight years ago — and I still haven’t left. I’ve taught English, got married, had a kid (well, my wife did most of the heavy lifting there), started working as a translator and now I do my best to help people all over Japan improve their work life or get hired in the first place. I’ve learned a lot about myself and had a hell of a lot more fun than I ever thought I would. Sure, there have been some tough times mixed in as well, but overall I’m extremely happy with my choice. I’ll admit: It wasn’t a cakewalk for me to get that first job in Japan. While I was full of enthusiasm and had sufficient credentials (a degree in anything), my first resume resulted in exactly zero interviews. I was at a loss. I wrote about how much I loved Japan, how interested I was in the culture, mentioned my degree in passing, and noted how I was willing to work anywhere in the country — even the deep inaka (countryside) like I had heard hiring departments would want to hear. But it wasn’t working out. Nobody was giving me a second look. I thought my quest to work in Japan was over, but then I got some sage advice that I’d like to share with you. While I was lamenting my fate, I showed my CV and cover letter to a college friend who had already been accepted into the JET program and asked for his thoughts. The first words of his response were: "" ""Everyone applying wants to work in Japan, bro."" "" I read through my cover letter again and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Every paragraph was some form of me talking about why I was interested in Japan. I wrote about all of the things I planned on doing to become a true ""cultural ambassador."" I spent many sentences going on about how hard I would study Japanese, and how I would strive to become a part of whatever community I found myself joining. I mentioned the travels I already had planned for when I arrived. Basically, I told them all about why I wanted to work in Japan. It was a page-long essay about my love of Japan — nothing more. I wrote only minimally about the skills I would bring to the table in performing the job. I gave no information about my past experience teaching people. I didn’t once talk about my desire to help people learn. "" ""Basically, I provided nothing that would convince my future employer that I was anything more than someone who wanted someone to pay them to move to Japan."" "" So I started over from scratch, limiting my still considerable interest in Japan to a single paragraph. I spent the rest of my cover letter explaining why I would be a valuable asset for their organizations. Before long, I was able to nab an interview and then lock down a position. It wasn’t until years later that I would learn just how common this resume-writing mistake is — and it’s easy to understand why. While you’re in your home country, the fact that you want to work in Japan seems like a big deal. And to you, it absolutely is. It’s the thing that’s prompting you to search for jobs thousands of miles away . But the companies you’re applying to? Well, guess what? They’re already in Japan. They don’t care how much you might enjoy their country — they want to know if you can do the job. So if you’re living outside Japan and trying to apply for that first job to get your foot in the door, keep this in mind: While it’s great to mention how enthusiastic you are about the country, if you can’t tie it into how that will help you be a great JET, ALT, translator, CIR, or whatever, it’s just wasted space. The people making the hiring decisions are ultimately looking for people that can help them fulfill their companies’ goals. Would they like to hire someone who’s got a genuine interest in Japan? Sure. Would they like for that person to also have a boatload of relevant experience? Hells yes! Bear this in mind when applying for jobs in Japan and you’ll be way ahead of the game — unlike me all those years ago.",how enthusiastic you are about the country
3114,"Friends has, for the most part, sent its stars down distinct, easily defined paths. Jennifer Aniston is a star. Matthew Perry will play the quirky, quippy lead in mediocre sitcoms until he dies or gets bored, and Courteney Cox will draw eyeballs on TV when she wants to (though she’s taking a justified break after the end of Cougar Town). Matt LeBlanc bounced around for a while (Episodes comes to an end next year) and is now hosting Top Gear. Lisa Kudrow continues to do weird, beautiful projects that get prematurely cancelled (The Comeback). But David Schwimmer has had, perhaps, the oddest, quietest career and after a few years of doing seemingly very little, he’s returned to TV with a pair of high-profile roles in FX’s OJ Simpson drama and now in his own vehicle, Feed the Beast. Whisper it, but after the McConaissance (Matthew McConaughey) and the Reesening (Reese Witherspoon), the Schwimmnaissance is finally here, and it’s been overdue. The Friends reunion was a total car crash Besides some theater work, Schwimmer’s big move after the end of Friends was providing the voice of Melman the giraffe in Madagascar. In an interview, Schwimmer explains why he was cast as Melman by describing the character as ""neurotic, and a hypochondriac, and paranoid"". Then, jokingly acknowledging his affinity with the character, Schwimmer swivels his head around as if hunting for the person who tricked him into being complicit in his own typecasting. Many of his other TV roles have boiled down to similar caricature, like an extended bit playing himself in the fourth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where Schwimmer is brought in to replace his Madagascar co-star Ben Stiller as Leo Bloom in a production of The Producers in which Larry plays Bialystock. (Schwimmer mostly exists to fight with Larry about the cashew-raisin ratio in a bag of mixed nuts.) This seems ridiculous with time, as Stiller has remained a huge star, but it wasn’t so out of the question at the time – Curb’s fourth season aired in 2004, the same year Friends went off the air. However, Schwimmer’s best post-Friends performances are largely against-type. As struggling actor Jared-turned eco-icon Greenzo on 30 Rock, he’s an out-and-out asshole, rather than the asshole who thinks he’s the nicest guy in the world. And the dramatic pinnacle of his career is a turn in Band of Brothers as the small-minded, petty Captain Sobel, where Schwimmer’s capacity for resentment found a full outlet. But roles like this didn’t keep coming, or at least Schwimmer didn’t keep taking them. Add that to the internet’s hatred for Ross Geller, and it seems clear: Schwimmer is a character actor trapped by the reputation accrued in a mistaken leading role. So it makes sense that he turned to directing, though this didn’t prove a much better choice. Take his debut: Run Fatboy Run, a Simon Pegg vehicle about a cowardly man who leaves his pregnant fiancee at the altar, then wins her back by running really hard. The script is rather bleak, and it would be easy to imagine a version of the movie that underlines the absurdity of the whole premise. But Schwimmer directs Run Fatboy Run as a totally straight, inspirational story without only a hint of the misanthropy and surrealism the material seems to demand. David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian, Cuba Gooding Jr as OJ Simpson aka The Juice. It was a long few years in the wilderness, but Schwimmer was saved by another 90s icon: OJ Simpson. As Robert Kardashian in The People v OJ Simpson, Schwimmer manages to take the pathetic quality of Ross Geller – the hangdog look, drooping eyes, open mouth – and channel it into misplaced moral superiority as the only person in the courtroom who is actually convinced of OJ’s innocence and thinks it matters. It helps that Schwimmer’s committed performance has produced one of the best memes in a show committed to generating memes: a supercut of Schwimmer saying the word ""juice"". Schwimmer, sadly, does not say ""juice"" in Feed the Beast, the mob-chef drama that seems like it arose from the early brainstorming sessions for Burnt. He remains steadfastly unable to do a straight performance, without veering into meme territory. Schwimmer plays Tommy, a widower single father in the Bronx who works as a wine representative while drowning his dream of being a sommelier in a bottle and is struggling to raise his mute biracial son while dealing with his fresh-out-of-prison best friend, Dion (played by Jim Sturgess). His best moments on Feed the Beast are comic, responding to the gleeful mania of Jim Sturgess’s Dion with a beat-down shrug. It’s closer to the energy he has on 30 Rock or Curb. The bulk of Feed the Beast reads closer to Schwimmer’s first big dramatic role: Duane Hopwood. The movie stars Schwimmer as the title character, a struggling casino pit boss in Atlantic City at odds with his ex-wife (Janeane Garofalo) and her new boyfriend (John Krasinski), navigating male bonding with his aspiring comedian friend (Judah Friedlander). Also, he’s dealing with the fallout from a DUI, which forces him to ride a bike to work. For all the supposed seriousness of Duane Hopwood, the image of Schwimmer on a bike is indicative of the ways the movie is irrevocably of its time (a montage is set to Rockin’ the Suburbs). It’s one of several mid-00s vaguely whimsical dramas about men navigating adulthood with the tools of childhood, but one of the only ones that takes its project so seriously. (Duane begins to overcome his alcoholism after a single AA meeting, mystically lets go of his ex-wife, and doesn’t even get that much blowback for driving over 80mph drunk with his daughter in the car.) Schwimmer plays Hopwood as an empty shell of a man, redeemed mostly because the script says so, and because it would be too depressing if he wound up alone. Like Duane Hopwood and much of his post-Friends career, Feed the Beast makes David Schwimmer a square peg in a role hole. He has to express serious levels of grieving, engage in complicated business transactions with his character’s estranged father, and most dangerous of all, parent his child (who receives The Talk about cops in one of the series’ more strained moments). None of these are flattering things to ask of Schwimmer, who has a strong skill set in other areas. (Namely, playing hyper-earnest parts that are easily digestible into memes. Sorry.) If the Schwimmnaissance is to have any hope of sticking, he’ll have to find something a lot more square. (Namely, playing hyper-earnest parts that are easily digestible into memes.) This explains why Schwimmer’s recent lip sync rap battle with James Corden was so successful – late-night talk shows are now essentially incubators for hyper-earnest memes.","after the McConaissance (Matthew McConaughey) and the Reesening (Reese Witherspoon), the Schwimmnaissance is finally here"

3119,"1. You like to keep your sheets clean For those who despise doing laundry, bed sheets stay cleaner longer if you only sleep on them right after a shower. If you climb into bed with the day's grime still covering your body, you'll need to wash the sheets much more frequently. 2. You like to relax before bed Just like how morning showers can stimulate creativity, night showers can help you unwind after a long day. A nice hot shower can relax your muscles and give you a chance to be alone with your thoughts, which can also help you fall asleep faster. 3. You have dry skin or wear a lot of makeup Those with oily skin may benefit from a shower first thing in the morning, but for people with dry skin morning showers can just exacerbate the problem. And if you wear makeup, it's important to remember to wash it off every night. While simply washing your face at night is usually enough to keep clean, the steam from the shower can help deep clean your pores more effectively. 4. You accumulate lots of dirt during the day If you barely break a sweat all day, you may not have much to wash off before bed. But if you have a physical job or work outside during the day (or even if you live in an especially polluted area or spend a lot of time on public transportation), it's much more hygienic to cleanse away the day's filth before hitting the hay. If you don't, it could lead to clogged pores, according to Bethanee Schlosser, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Women's Skin Health Program for Northwestern Medicine.","But if you have a physical job or work outside during the day (or even if you live in an especially polluted area or spend a lot of time on public transportation), it's much more hygienic to cleanse away the day's filth before hitting the hay."

3126,"Justin Morrice with daughter Annabelle (left), Gerber Lil’ Crunchies (right) A father was feeding his daughter the same popular puff snacks he’s always given her when she began acting odd. Frantic to fix what was happening, the dad had to save her life when she stopped breathing. After she was stabilized, he noticed an alarming message he had never seen before on the back of the snack container. Had Justin Morrice’s little girl Annabelle not nearly died, he would have never thought to look at the misplaced message on the Gerber Lil’ Crunchies container, but now he’s bringing a lot of attention to it. The 10-month-old had never had a problem with the puffs until this incident that could happen to anyone if they don’t follow this simple word of advice that the baby food company should have made more apparent. In a now viral Facebook post , Justin explained that his daughter was eating the light and airy snack when she suddenly stopped breathing. Within 10 seconds, the baby’s lips had already started turning blue. ""She was trying to cry but no sound was coming out,"" Justin recalled. ""I rushed over and picked her up and turned her over and slapped her back (as we were taught) for what seemed like forever. I still could not hear anything."" The father’s survival mechanisms kicked into high gear, and he jammed his fingers down Annabelle’s throat to break apart anything that was blocking her airway. The only reason this happened is because of a little-known issue with what happens to the puffs after five days of opening the can. After hearing her cry and knowing that she survived the choking incident, Justin started to investigate the snacks and saw a rather hidden warning on the can that said, ""Use within five days after removing seal for optimal freshness."" He grabbed a snack out of the can and bit into himself when he realized that the puff was hard as a rock when it should have dissolved quickly on its own. ""The ones in the can she choked on I can only describe to be like a foam ear plug. I could squish it but it would expand back out and would not break apart,"" he explained in the post. ""The ones in the new can crumbled with ease."" He hadn’t had the can for weeks or months, as staleness set in almost immediately after the 5-day expiration time. Within two weeks, Justin’s post has been shared over 40,000 times, getting the word out about this serious concern since the company didn’t make it more known. For a snack to expire in five days of opening is far sooner than anyone would expect and a fact that Gerber should have probably made clearer. Maybe now that a baby nearly died from the suddenly stale puffs, the company will put the warning in bigger print and avoid a future lawsuit.","""Use within five days after removing seal for optimal freshness."""

3131,"Santa Claus is coming to town, or actually, the internet.  Like so much of the planet, the jolly red man has found a home online. Booking gigs, talking with fans, finding the perfect red suit — it all happens there. But like many of us mere mortals, Santa's social life and work life are two different worlds that just sometimes merge. That's where secret online communities come in.  Yes, there are Santas on LinkedIn and others marketing themselves on social media, but ""Santa groupies"" and a need for more privacy have driven many to connect in hidden online groups.  SEE ALSO: Take this festive virtual tour of Santa’s house at the North Pole Whenever there's a public Facebook group dedicated to working Santas, they become ""overwhelmed with Santa groupies"" John Chilson, a Santa from Colorado, told Mashable, defining ""Santa groupies"" as ""people who just want to hang out with Santas, know everything about them."" It's a real problem. And like anyone else, sometimes Santa just wants to talk with his friends.  ""There are a lot of Santa groups on Facebook where you have to become a member,"" Norm Gerring, a cofounder and administrator of a web-based haven for Santa-style socializing in Michigan, said. ""I think they deserve a right to talk with each other openly and freely."" Gerring's site, called Michigan Association of Professional Santas, or MAPS, can only be accessed by members. And to become one, you must usually be recommended by another Santa. ""For those who are referred to as a 'real bearded Santa,' it is a lifestyle."" On the site's blog, Santas can post about things like liability insurance tips or the gigs they can't do. Dave Downs, who cofounded the site and goes by the name ""Big Wave Santa,"" said postings for jobs  are picked up ""usually within hours or minutes."" But it's not just professional networking happening behind the scenes. The Santas share stories and photos and commiserate with one another, too.  ""For those who are referred to as a 'real bearded Santa,' it is a lifestyle,"" Gerring said, adding the pressure can be tough when representing the iconic Christmas figure. ""You have to be very careful when you're out in public because people look at you."" In fact, not too long ago during the pre-internet days, it was very different. ""It was a lonely job,"" Gerring said. Gradually, little groups started forming around the country and the online communities grew, he said. The web was a game-changer: ""I believe it has helped immensely,"" he said. Now, the online world of Santa has been whittled down to tight-knit communities.  Members can freely talk about what it's like to be Santa, from the naughty to the nice and everything in between. They can also plan meet-ups.  Through the MAPS website, Santas from around Michigan get together for casual breakfast gatherings or the organization's annual dinner in January, when dozens talk about the last Christmas and cap off the night with cookies and milk. Last year's event drew 85 Santas, Downs said.  So what do these guys talk about? Well, being Santa is kind of like being in Fight Club. But some Santas would share a few general tidbits about their experiences. For one, there are mall Santas and then there are other Santas, a distinction made clear by professional Santas Mashable spoke with. Being a mall Santa is tough work, requiring 8- to 12-hour days, quick and sometimes unflattering photos and often traveling significant distances to hold down the gig.  ""I don’t do malls. I got friends that do,"" Downs said. ""I hear the horror stories ... I prefer home visits, where I have a chance to talk with the kids.""  What else do they talk about? Children's trust, and well, their pee. Jim Manning, a full-time professional Santa Claus, gave his tips on avoiding the pee of children during an AMA on Reddit in 2013. And apparently, it's all in the parents' body language as they hand the child to you with ""arms outstretched, elbows locked."" One of the Santas' biggest challenges, though, is that inevitable question: ""Is Santa real?"" That's got to be a toughie for anyone, but a good Santa is always prepared. And it's actually a question that gets asked ""almost everyday,"" Keith ""SantaFinn"" Makela of Rochester, Michigan said. His response is simple: ""Are you a real child? Are you a real kid?""  Makela attended the CW Howard Santa Claus School in Midland, Michigan, as well as the International University of Santa Claus. He learned about the history of Saint Nicholas and Santa Claus, proper dress and make-up, live reindeer habits and ""Santa Sign Language.""  From the pricey clothes to the priceless patience, there's a lot that goes into being Santa. But a lot of them will tell you they aren't just doing it for the cash. Rather, it's for something else. And it's something they can't usually find elsewhere. ""I had no idea before becoming Santa what it was like to walk around where there was no negative energy anywhere,"" Makela said. ""Wherever Santa goes, there’s nobody being negative about anything. That’s an interesting way to walk around."" So it turns out Santa does exist, and he's living life to the fullest IRL and online. You're just not invited to his private group.","there are Santas on LinkedIn and others marketing themselves on social media, but ""Santa groupies"" and a need for more privacy have driven many to connect in hidden online groups."
3134,"Pixabay August 21, 2017. Mark it in your diaries folks, as this is the day that the Earth will definitely, definitely, definitely begin its painful and miserable end, apparently. Well, that’s what a group of pretty radical Christian folk think, claiming that on that very date – perhaps the darkest date in world history – a worldwide solar eclipse will plunge the Earth into darkness and the end of the world will begin. According to The Sun, a total lunar eclipse will hit America on August 21 before a similar eclipse takes over mainland Europe – however, a hardcore Christian website, Unsealed, have used this eclipse to suggest it will be the beginning of the end of the world. Flickr Apparently, the website is keen to link to some specific passages from The Book of Revelations which claim a woman who is clothed in the sun, with the moon at her feet, will be hunted by a Satanic seven-headed dragon looking to eat her unborn child. The scripture claims that the child will be born and taken up to God where an army of angels defeat the dragon. Wikimedia Unsealed also use the establishment of Israel as a state as proof for the end of the world. Israel was founded back in 1947, when the UK announced their withdrawal from Palestine, and Biblical writings refer to the establishment of Israel when referring to the end of the world. Next year will mark the 70th year birthday of Israel – a full Biblical generation. Wikimedia The Christian group also point towards the 12th-century Rabbi, Judah Ben Samuel, who said the end times would come in 2017. Unsealed predict that while the end of the world will begin next year, it will only officially end in Autumn 2024, so that’s a good seven years of pain, torture, torment and misery to look forward to before death finally seeps in and destroys us all. Surely, one day an apocalyptic prediction will actually come true – but I can’t see this being the one.","According to The Sun, a total lunar eclipse will hit America on August 21 before a similar eclipse takes over mainland Europe – however, a hardcore Christian website, Unsealed, have used this eclipse to suggest it will be the beginning of the end of the world."
3137,"This post contains spoilers for Captain America: Civil War. If you haven’t seen the film yet or don’t want to be spoiled on anything, now is that time to go. Spoilers ahoy after one more firm warning from Cap. If you’re not deep into internet culture, you may be unaware of the intensely devoted section of the Captain America fan base who consider Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), not Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), to be the true object of Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) affection. Oh but they’re out there. Just search Bucky/Steve and you’ll see what I mean. But make sure you have the safe search mode switched on first. When Captain America: Civil War directors Joe and Anthony Russo went on a publicity tour for the latest installment in Marvel’s Avengers franchise, they were very careful not to throw cold water on the popular fan theory that Steve ""Captian America"" Rogers and Bucky ""The Winter Soldier"" Barnes were more than friends. ""People can interpret the relationship however they want to interpret it,"" Joe Russo said while visiting China. ""People have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it’s great to see people argue about it what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it they can interpret it."" Even Evans and Stan seemed happy to throw fuel on the Bucky/Steve theories during the publicity tour. But despite what Joe Russo said, doesn’t Captain America: Civil War go out of its way to ""define"" Bucky and Steve’s relationship when Cap smooches Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) while Bucky looks on approvingly? Where’s the room for interpretation in that moment? And, leaving aside the vague creepiness of Steve making a move on Peggy’s (very willing) niece, the moment itself wasn’t necessary to the flow of the movie at all. As was the case in Captain America: Winter Soldier, VanCamp is a hugely appealing (if slightly underused) member of the cast. The film even gave her one of Captain’s most iconic comic book speeches when Sharon and Steve are mulling over how to move forward in the shadow of Peggy’s death. It’s a great moment for her and for the story. And while I think Agent Peggy Carter would have encouraged Agent Sharon Carter to join in the big fight on the tarmac, in general Sharon’s insider access to the government served the story very well. But did they have to throw in that kiss? Romance has never been hugely successful in the world of The Avengers. With the exception of the bittersweet distance between Cap and Peggy and the very useful friction between Tony and Pepper in Iron Man 3 and Civil War, the Avengers love stories have fallen rather flat. Jane and Thor were so spark-less that Natalie Portman’s absence in Thor 3 is neither surprising nor all that damaging to the franchise. The brewing love story between Vision and Scarlet Witch (yeah, it’s in the comics) is frankly rather creepy given the relative ages of Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olson. And Black Widow’s half-hearted love affair with the Hulk was one of the many things that didn’t work in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In fact, Scarlett Johansson’s hugely popular character is the most fun when she nowhere near romance but, rather, palling around with Hawkeye and Steve. Perhaps it’s Joss Whedon’s influence on Phase 2 of Marvel’s superhero universe, but these characters seem destined to not be happy in a relationship unless, like Hawkeye, they take their love stories completely off the grid. But Marvel seems to think it has to have its heroes in heterosexual love affairs in order to maximize audience appeal. But with the franchise slowly making room for women to be more than girlfriends and sidekicks (seriously, Sharon should have been on that tarmac), a love story just for the sake of some kisses and yearning seems out of place in these spirited adventures. Sure, the Sharon and Steve connection served a narrative purpose. It showed that Cap was finally willing to close the door on Peggy. Something he could never do while his Agent Carter was alive. But, honestly, there was more juice in Bucky ogling Steve’s bulging bicep as Cap struggled to ground a helicopter using only gumption and sinew. So while Marvel was likely never going to make the homoerotic subtext of Cap and Bucky into text, would it really have hurt to keep their relationship more ambiguous? As if to put the nail in the coffin of speculation, Bucky and Cap paused for a moment in the middle of snowy Siberia to reminisce about their days chasing skirts in pre-War Brooklyn. It’s a sweet, human bonding moment but one that also bristles with heterosexual virility. If Disney isn’t inclined to give audiences a gay superhero, couldn’t they have at least left us the dream of Bucky and Cap?","So while Marvel was likely never going to make the homoerotic subtext of Cap and Bucky into text, would it really have hurt to keep their relationship more ambiguous?"

3143,"The older woman, who struggled into the taxi office one morning, made me catch my breath in pity and anger. Reliant, as many of we pensioners are on the local cabbies, we get to know them well and they’re often happy to chat. On this particular morning, the taxi controller had remembered it was this lady’s 80th birthday at the weekend. ‘Is your daughter taking you somewhere nice for lunch?’ he asked. The pained look on her face gave him his answer. ‘Maybe,’ she said. ‘If she can fit it in. The little one’s got a swimming gala. They’re always so busy, they both work, and the grandchildren have so many clubs. I hardly see them these days. But you know how it is, you daren’t say anything.’ I was upset enough hearing how this lovely lady might be spending her birthday on her own, while her family lived less than five miles away. Then I heard that final remark... you daren’t say anything. Could it be that this woman was actually afraid of her own daughter? Time and time again we are told of the epidemic of loneliness in this country. One in ten over-65s feels chronically lonely all the time, yet most suffer in silence, through fear of appearing a nuisance. More often than not, these are not old people cut off from their families or left alone without surviving relatives. Many have family who are simply too caught up in their own lives to make time for them. I was reminded of this by a poignant letter in this paper recently. It was short, but it spoke volumes about the abysmal way we treat our elderly in this country. ‘You can also be a long-distance granny when your family live close-by,’ she wrote. ‘I live about 25 miles from my four grandsons but so far in 2017 we have seen two of them for about three hours.’ And the final cri de coeur: ‘Just a phone call would be welcome.’ As a journalist, I wanted to know more and speak to this lady, to hear her story. But she didn’t want to cause a fuss or be a nuisance. She didn’t want them to stop calling completely. It broke my heart. Having just become a grandmother — my son Elias and daughter-in-law Eva presented me with a granddaughter, Amber Ann, on November 29 — it seems to me one of the cruellest ironies of today that families can exacerbate loneliness among the elderly rather than protect them from it. Fear of being seen as a nuisance, or upsetting someone and being shunned, is creeping into these relationships like a virus. It can almost feel in some families that time is used as a bargaining tool. One ride out to the seaside for tea and scones once a month, in return for a helping hand with the school fees? Surely not. I’m lucky, my son married a Polish girl. She frequently tells me she finds the British attitude towards the elderly utterly incomprehensible. She has told me quite emphatically that any grandchildren will be ‘trained’ to look after me ‘when I’m old’ (I’m 76, and enormously flattered she still considers me youthful). She also says I’m welcome to move in with them whenever I need to. I feel very lucky. But this, sadly, in our country, is an antiquated view. Now our children are placing their parents squarely at the bottom of their priority list in their busy lives. Too often I see feisty grandparents cowed. They daren’t suggest or guide, never utter a direct or ‘tactless’ word. They just keep quiet. ‘You’re always walking on egg-shells,’ one 75-year-old grandmother explained to me, during a pre-granddaughter ‘pep talk’. ‘Whatever you suggest, it will be wrong. They do things differently today. You mustn’t say a word.’ I’ve witnessed polished women, the sort who might have gone to finishing school, smiling feebly as their grandchildren piggishly shovel food into their mouths, wipe their noses on their hands and vandalise furniture. They’re so grateful to be invited they ‘daren’t say anything’. How many grandparents (or parents) do you know who feel they can just ‘pop in’ to see their children or grandchildren? Many have to make ‘appointments’ (often lasting about as long as the routine GP appointment). If they’re lucky they are ‘invited’ (often months ahead) to a meal or gathering, where they’re largely ignored, as children and grandchildren alike barely look up from their phones. One 60-year-old described how she delivered birthday presents to her grandchildren — and was barely acknowledged. She had to call to ask how they liked them. It wasn’t always thus: growing up in the Fifties, I may not have always looked forward to the obligatory weekly family get-together — either sitting round a coal fire in my grandmother’s modest kitchen, or sat on stiff- backed horsehair chairs in the ‘front room’ — but I always went and I always behaved myself. I may not have liked my mother badgering me to write thank you notes the second I received a gift, or to send birthday cards to all my vast horde of relatives. I used to complain that this ritual card-sending, calls, and so on substituted real feeling, but at least it showed someone had thought about them. Those relatives were never isolated, always included in everything. Even in advanced stages of illness, geriatric wards or care homes would have been unthinkable — considered akin to the workhouse. I remember grandparents and elderly aunts being cared for at home. They were family and had a right to love and care, and somehow their presence added colour and richness to our lives. My widowed grandmother — my father’s mother — was taken in by both my family and another son, and her presence was very much felt. She was certainly not scared to speak up, and I know she went through a few rough patches with her daughters-in-law. But cowed? Frightened of being left isolated and lonely? Unthinkable. She was included in everything, however difficult and demanding she could be. Then there’s that feeling of being surplus to requirements. In my day, when elderly relatives lived at home, they were expected to muck in as much as they were able and became an essential component of the family. One friend complained to me recently that she felt her children would treat her better if they needed her more. She hardly ever saw them, but with nannies and cleaners propping up the family, didn’t see any opportunities to make herself useful. I think it’s time for families to schedule a meeting and talk —really talk. Not skirt around each other, or slot in a quick chat on the way to hockey practice. Children and grandchildren need to recognise that loneliness kills, that it impoverishes and damages society just as much as economic hardship or unhealthy life choices. In neglecting your old folk, you’re not just being thoughtless — you’re threatening their lives. And we grandparents have to play our part, too. We have to stop being so meek and reclaim our role as involved elders. We must not swallow the myth that somehow we’re undeserving, that we all had it easy, sitting pretty in our big houses, with our free university education and guaranteed jobs. We can make demands and not always fear rejection or abandonment. We can make our loneliness and deepest fears known. I now let my children — both Elias and his sister, Mina — know what I expect from them. This ranges from insisting they call and visit regularly — they call in at least once a week, and we speak or email every day. I’ve learned to ask them if there’s something I want. It hasn’t all been plain sailing. I’ve sometimes come a cropper and been sent to Coventry for a while after I’ve read them the ‘Riot Act’ when the phone calls have lapsed, but better to make feelings known than suffer in silence. To end loneliness and cultivate compassion, we must stop being cowed by our children and start making demands. Because, as the slogan says, we’re worth it...

3144,"I will never forget the day my daughter told me that Bethany, a girl in her 4th grade class, was annoying her. ""What is she doing to you?"" I questioned, instinctively protective. ""She’s following me around on the playground and sitting by me at lunch!"" she quipped, as if that would sum things right up and get me squarely on her side of the matter. ""You mean she’s trying to be friends with you?"" I asked incredulously. I realized immediately that I had a problem on my hands. I was raising my own worst nightmare. Smack dab in the middle of my brood of five kids, was a charismatic, sassy, leggy, blonde, dance-y, athletic girl oozing confidence ... and apparently annoyance, directed toward another little girl that wasn’t lucky enough to be her. Inconveniently for my daughter, her own mother WAS Bethany in grade school. Freckled of face and frizzy of hair, I was an Army brat, always the new girl clamoring for a friend, drawn to the natural confidence of girls like my daughter. This conversation found me vacillating between heartache and fury, but one thing I knew for sure: Mama was about to put her money where her mouth had been all these years. The battle of two very strong wills ensued at my home the next morning. It wasn’t pretty, but I prevailed. My daughter attended a private Catholic grade school, where on any given day, she and a handful of her cohorts ruled the roost. One quick phone call to Bethany’s mother that same evening confirmed my worst fears. My daughter and her posse were using everything short of a can of ""Cling Free"" to rid themselves of the annoying Bethany. I’m sure there are parents out there who will say I overreacted. But, I firmly believe we’ve got to start to address our country’s bullying epidemic right at the heart; by re-defining bullying at its very core. To me, the rejection and complete lack of interest my daughter and her ""clique"" displayed toward Bethany was the beginning of a subtle type of bullying. It is true (confirmed to me by Bethany’s mom and teachers), that there was no overt unkindness or name-calling, etc., just rejection; a complete lack of interest in someone they wrongly concluded had nothing to offer them. After experiencing childhood myself and raising five of my own, I’ve been on every side of the bullying social dynamic, and I am convinced this is where it begins. A casual assessment and quick dismissal of an outsider. We would serve our children well, in my opinion, if we had a frank conversation with them about Social Darwinism and what motivates human beings to accept and reject others. It happens at every age and stage of life, race, creed and religion. It has its roots in our own fears of rejection and lack of confidence. Everyone is jockeying for their own spot on the Social Food Chain. I feel like I have experienced demonstrable success with my children by tabling this dynamic right out in the open. Parents need to call it by name, speak it out loud, shine a bright light in its ugly face. We need to admit to our children that we too experience this, even as adults. Of course it’s tempting to ‘curry favor’ and ‘suck-up’ to the individual a rung of two above you on the Social Ladder, but every single human being deserves our attention and utmost respect. In spite of this, we have to constantly remind our children and ourselves that everyone can bring unexpected and unanticipated value to our lives. But we have to let them. It’s simply not enough to instruct your children to ""Be Nice!"" You’ve got to be more specific than that. Kids think if they aren’t being outright unkind, they are being nice. We know better. Connect the ugly dots. Explain the Darwinistic social survival instinct that’s often motivating and guiding their impulses. I promise you, they can handle it. They already see it on some level anyway. They just need YOU to give it a voice and re-direction. As for my girl, I instructed her that she was going to invest some time and energy getting to know Bethany. I assigned her to come home from school the next day and report three cool things she found out about Bethany, that she didn’t previously know. My strong-willed child dug in. She did not want to do that. I dug in deeper. I refused to drive her to school the next morning, until she agreed. It seemed that, at least until now, I had the car keys and the power. Her resistance gave us time to have the Social Darwinism conversation. I walked her through my ""ATM Machine Analogy."" I explained to her that she had social bank to spare. She could easily make a withdrawal on behalf of this little girl, risking very little. ""Let’s invest!"" I enthused and encouraged. She got dressed reluctantly and I drove her to school. She had a good day—what was left of it. But, she was still buggy with me when I picked her up, telling me that her friends’ mothers ""stay out of such matters"" and let their daughters ""choose their own friends!"" (Such wise women.) And then she told me three cool things about Bethany that she didn’t previously know. I checked back in with Bethany’s mother by phone two weeks later. It’s called follow through. (I don’t think enough of us are doing that. We ""helicopter"" over our kids’ wardrobes, nutrition, sleep schedules, hygiene, science fair projects and then pride ourselves on how ""hands off"" we are on social issues. If I had a dollar for every time I wanted to say, ""Seriously? You micro-manage the literal crap out of every thing your child does from his gluten intake to his soccer cleats, but THIS you stay out of?"" No wonder there’s zero accountability and a bullying culture!) Bethany’s mother assured me that she had been welcomed into the fold of friendship and was doing well. Bethany’s family moved to another state a few years later. My daughter cried when they parted ways. They still keep in touch through all their social media channels. She was and is a really cool girl, with a lot to offer her peers. But the real value was to my daughter, obviously. She gained so much through that experience. She is now a 20-year-old college sophomore, with a widely diverse group of friends. She is kind, inclusive and open to all types of people. When she was malleable, impressionable and mine to guide: —She learned her initial instinct about people isn’t always correctly motivated. —She learned you can be friends with the least likely people; the best friendships aren’t people that are your ""type!"" In the world of friendship, contrast is a plus. —She learned that there are times, within a given social framework, that you are in a position to make a withdrawal on behalf of someone else. Be generous, invest! It pays dividends. But, most importantly, she learned that, while I may not be overly-interested in what she gets on her Science Fair project, couldn’t care less if she’s Lactose Intolerant or whether her long blonde hair is snarled, she’s going to damn well treat people right. Parents—your kids are going to eventually develop the good sense to wear a jacket and eat vegetables, invest your energy in how they interact within society.

3146,"Can Drinking Bleach Help You Pass a Drug Test? Never drink undiluted household bleach. Mark Gallagher, Wikipedia Commons There are all kinds of rumors about ways you can beat a drug test. Obviously the easiest way to pass the test is to avoid taking drugs in the first place, but that’s not going to be much help if you’ve already taken something and are facing a test. According to Snopes, some people drink bleach believing it will somehow clear their system of drugs. While it is unclear where this idea originated, the rumor is out there. Will it work? Will drinking bleach hurt you or kill you? Here’s the lowdown: Drinking Bleach to Pass a Drug Test Household bleach consists of about 5.25% sodium hypochlorite in water. Specifically, Clorox says their bleach contains water, sodium hypochlorite, sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and sodium polyacrylate. They also make scented products that include fragrances. Bleach also contains small amounts of impurities, which aren’t a big deal when you’re using the product for disinfection or cleaning, but could prove toxic if ingested. None of these ingredients binds to drugs or their metabolites or inactivates them such that you would test negative on a drug test. What Happens If You Drink Bleach? So, of course you are wondering what happens if you drink bleach. People have done this and lived to tell the tale. Drinking a small amount of bleach won’t kill you, particularly if you dilute it in water, but it is corrosive and can irritate or damage your mucous membranes and esophagus. Ingesting a few milliliters of bleach most likely will irritate your eyes, nose and throat and may cause nausea and vomiting and possibly diarrhea. Vomiting a small amount of bleach is not recommended, since this re-exposes your esophagus to the chemicals and may worsen the damage. Drinking a larger volume of bleach can hurt or kill you. The toxicity results from the chlorine gas that is produced, the corrosivity of bleach and ingestion of sodium (hypernatremia). Chest pain, low blood pressure, shock and possibly coma or death may result from either inhaling too much bleach or drinking it. The Bottom Line Drinking bleach won’t help you pass a drug test and may make you sick or dead. Share Your Bleach and Drug Test Experience Have you tried drinking bleach to pass a drug test? You’re welcome to post a reply to share your experience. Comments David says: I hadn’t heard the blech myth but I had heard of vinegar. Any chance? I never believed it but then I never needed to worry about it. stoner says: Bleadh works in small small amounts if dilluted and with a good drink to wash it down Nick420 says: the stoner is correct. dont chug, just about 4 driples into some carbonated dark pop. indeed it does work. but only in a light dosage. cant stress that enough. after that drink a gallon of water. do all of this the day befor your test. Jay says: It works!!! One cap x one half gallon does the trick, just be sure to use bathroom once before the test and the next load should be ok. Remedy has worked three times for me. mar says: hey stoner, will this method work with proxies joe blogs says: yeah i tasted bleach and it tasted yum Jae says: You people have the intelligence of a circus monkey. Actually, scratch that....I’m sure a circus monkey would be smart enough not to drink bleach. IDIOTS.... Whitedog says: Who in their right mind would ever drink bleach?? Cant you just put a few drops into the urine thats being tested Silhouette says: Are you people especially dense or something. The woman just said don’t try it at all because it can make you extremely ill or even kill you and here you all still go giving the desperate saps of the world ways to attempt to get around the inevitable. I mean why bother? If you took drugs in the first place then you don’t value your brain or body much anyway! So go ahead, try it! Listen to the addicts of the world and drink one teaspoon of bleach per half gallon of water. While we’re all watching your sad story on the news shaking our heads about the new craze, your family will either be making medical or burial arrangements for you. Hollywood says: Well I jus, drank it n hope I dont die hope I passs my test too Myra says: Silhouette, you’re right.Maybe those who said that its still ok to drink bleach are an addicts. Anyway,for sure,they are old enough for them to know what’s good and what’s bad to health. If they took dangerous drugs, knowing that it’s harmful, then why avoid bleach knowing it’s also harmful? Guys do you love your mom? then give value to yourself? Your mom didn’t carried you in a womb for 9 months then just to kill yourself. Life is a gift! ARCpoint Labs of Columbia says: All bleach would do is give you a false reading. It would not get you off the hook. Not to mention, who would want to risk the potential health problems. brandon says: DO NOT DRINK THE BLEACH why do people think that’s what the bleach method is?!?! you put it in the vial after you pee in it! Branden says: Will I die from drinking bleach MattRed says: Hey IDIOTS drinking the gallon of water a day before and almost up to the test day is what’s making you clean.... I HIGHLY doubt its the bleach LOL!!!!!! When you drink the gallon of water you are essentially urinating the water because your body is trying to get rid of the water overload. How or why bleach would work is beyond me because you need to time when the bleach would be passed through the urine and even then who says bleach would clean your urine from the inside? I would imagine the bleach would be gone right away and absorbed and contained somewhere in the human body never even making it to your bladder. It is also possible it could be removed from your body as stool. Especially in small amounts..... Just because you drink something it does not mean your body would automatically push it out as urine.This is pretty stupid! Just don’t do drugs. Or at least be smart and stop while being tested, or just drink water only, TONS of it. MsJaye Willz says: If you drink tons of water then you will look obvius becus then it will only show tht ur hydrated but also ur urine will lose coloring duhh ur jus pushing it out and refiltering it but bleach works also. everybody have there own method but the only thing tht matters is who pass it.... now stop blowin down cus sum people prefer to use bleach. h2eartz says: i dipped my toothbrush in bleach to whighten my teeth swollowd some with my spit by accident. Im fealing tingle fealing in both arms they are weak and cant make a fist all the way when i do feel like throwing up sleeping all day watery eyes nausious dizzy fealing loss of apetite. i think im die fealing sick i called poison control the lady said i will feal tingle fealing in my arms but she said im not goin to die!! i will be visiting the doc today cus their has to be something to clean me out now so i can go on with my normal life. star says: i drank bleach and it wiped out I MEAN EVERTHING EXCEPT A FAINT LINE OF CRACK Trevis says: I jus drank a very small amount of bleach diluted with water an passed a drug test Mommy74 says: How about not doing drugs while you are looking for a job, knowing that any respectable company will give you a drug test when they want to hire you? If you really want a job, quit smoking for couple of weeks and you don’t have to be an idiot and drink bleach! jmc says: I’ve drank a capful in a glass of chocolate milk and passed just fine never drinking any water at all. DaveO says: I smoked pot just before I had to take a drug test . I drank a gallon of water also before the test and passed the test... water is the best way to pass a drug test... drink water till you pee water.... works every time. DaveO says: I have a friend that mixed milk with bleach and says she passed the drug test with coke weed and zanex in her system I try to tell her to not do that. But she swears that it works.. ? haley says: this is a lie!!! you CAN pass a drug test by drinking bleach. i put two or three drops in a glass of water and passed my urine test. i only had pot in my system tho. idk if it works for anything else. but i DO know it works. izzy blackberry says: R u guys idot bleach dose not help u pass a drug test it will just case u damege in later life like drugs will so stop with th f**king drugs ok and bleach isn’t going to get u anywere so if ur on drugs get a life and go get help insted of covering it up if ur on drugs test u need help not bleach just get bloody help Sweet Jesus says: There are some g***mn idiots on this page. former stoner says: Hey dumba%%es saying you will be suspicious if you piss water in a drug test. just eat peanut butter and it will put color back in your piss. and you will be fine Drinking Bleach and Drug Tests Last modified: April 1st, 2016 by Anne Helmenstine",won’t help you pass a drug test and may make you sick or dead

3152,"A top Republican in Washington wants Facebook to explain exactly how it chooses the news in its ""trending"" topics section. The Commerce Committee, led by Republican John Thune of South Dakota, asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg to respond to anonymous allegations that former contractors suppressed news about conservatives and links to right-leaning websites. The controversy, first published by Gizmodo, is now trending on Facebook. In a letter on Tuesday, Thune demanded to know who is ultimately responsible for approving stories for the ""trending"" box on the Facebook home page; what steps Facebook has taken to investigate the claims of bias; and how Facebook keeps records of its editorial decisions. ""Please provide a list of all news stories removed from or injected into the Trending Topics section since January 2014,"" Thune's letter said. A Facebook spokesman confirmed that ""we have received Sen. Thune's request for more information about how Trending Topics works, and look forward to addressing his questions."" It remains to be seen just how forthcoming Facebook will be. In its role as a quasi-journalistic publisher of information, the company may shirk at the prospect of handing over information about its editorial processes. ""Facebook is free to reveal what information it chooses about its decision-making process and to defend its editorial process as it chooses,"" First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams told CNNMoney. ""Members of Congress and others may take issue with those decisions. But the First Amendment leaves no room for Congress to investigate or otherwise insert itself into Facebook's editorial decision-making."" While Facebook does not employ journalists who gather news, its News Feed is a powerful distributor of news stories from sources around the world. Teams of journalists and writers, known internally as ""news curators,"" are in charge of managing the trending topics box. Gizmodo's report on Monday said that ""Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network's influential 'trending' news section, according to a former journalist who worked on the project."" Other anonymous former Facebook workers disputed the account. And there is no concrete evidence of systemic bias at Facebook. But it is possible that some individual workers may have rejected specific stories. ""Trending Topics is designed to surface popular conversations — no matter where they fall on the political spectrum — and our guidelines require the review team members to allow all points of view,"" Facebook's Tuesday afternoon statement said. Indeed, the trending box regularly includes news about conservative news sources. ""We have seen allegations that people did not honor the intent of those guidelines. Although the allegations are anonymous, we take them seriously. We are continuing to investigate whether any violations took place,"" the Facebook statement continued. ""As we investigate, we will also keep reviewing our operational practices around Trending Topics — and if we find they are inadequate, we will take immediate steps to fix them."" Thune says he wants to know more about the operational practices. ""Social networks such as Facebook are an increasingly important source of news for many Americans and people around the world,"" he wrote. ""Facebook has enormous influence on users' perceptions of current events, including political perspectives.""

(With one gold medal for every 9.3 million citizens, we rank behind Greece, Singapore, and our North American rival, Canada.) Adjust the gold-medal count for GDP in the second table at the bottom of this article, and we plummet to No. 50 (trailing Romania, Argentina, South Africa, and Japan). If that doesn’t make even Katie Ledecky, Michael Phelps, and Simone Biles’ remarkable wins this year look rather paltry, consider this: Usain Bolt may have Jamaica grinning, but small island nations as a whole—especially Grenada, New Zealand, Fiji, Cuba, and the Bahamas—have also done well for themselves.

3157,"Why The Late Show Didn't Really Work At The Beginning, According To Stephen Colbert By jessica rawden People have kept a close eye on Stephen Colbert over the past year, as he's struggled to find his voice in the late night realm. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has been open about reworking the entire tone of the series over the past few months, and largely the tide has seemed to be turning for the late night host. Recently, Stephen Colbert explained why he thinks The Late Show really didn't work in the beginning. Here's what he had to say: People were watching me learn to play a new instrument in public. Now I really don't care and it's so much more fun. I tried so hard to be myself that I kept on fading away. I've surrendered to my natural instincts, and to how I actually feel on a daily basis. There were a lot of complaints early on that Stephen Colbert was stiff and really wasn't bringing anything new to the table. Even other celebrities had a few choice comments about the post-Letterman Late Show. For instance, Chelsea Handler memorably called Colbert's late night program ""not interesting"" and basically a carbon copy of everything else out there. Stephen Colbert's recent comments to the New York Times pretty much directly address the concerns people have had about his show in the past, also saying he looks forward to the future. Figuring out what direction The Late Show with Stephen Colbert should go in wasn't easy peasy, however. CBS heads actually sat down with Colbert to see what changes could be made to make the host's role easier. Changes in producers also occurred, with Meredith Bennett stepping down and Chris Licht took over as the showrunner on the series, working with the network and its late night host to figure out what will work best for all involved parties. The show has begun incorporating a bit more of Stephen Colbert's fun-spirited comedy antics---similar to what he used to do on The Colbert Report. In addition, several live episodes have also helped to jazz the show up a little bit more. All of it, Stephen Colbert reports, has helped the show to just be more fun---both for himself and for viewers. He's come to the realization that his former cable persona is still a part of him, and that's ok, as well. It is all me. Of course it's me. I thought of the character. It's my humor... If I do things that are like the old show, it was a good show. Fall TV is just now kicking off, and with it comes a brand new season of late night. There will be silly interviews and avid ones, viral videos and live shows. There will be great musical guests and terrible ones. Hopefully, in the middle of all of this, Stephen Colbert will finally pull away from the pack. New episodes of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert air on weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET.

3164,"English grammar, beloved by sticklers, is also feared by non-native speakers. Many of its idiosyncrasies can turn into traps even for the most confident users. But some of the most binding rules in English are things that native speakers know but don’t know they know, even though they use them every day. When someone points one out, it’s like a magical little shock. This week, for example, the BBC’s Matthew Anderson pointed out a ""rule"" about the order in which adjectives have to be put in front of a noun. Judging by the number of retweets—over 47,000 at last count—this came as a complete surprise to many people who thought they knew all about English: Things native English speakers know, but don't know we know: pic.twitter.com/Ex0Ui9oBSL — Matthew Anderson (@MattAndersonBBC) September 3, 2016 That quote comes from a book called The Elements of Eloquence: How to Turn the Perfect English Phrase. Adjectives, writes the author, professional stickler Mark Forsyth, ""absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac."" Mixing up the above phrase does, as Forsyth writes, feel inexplicably wrong (a rectangular silver French old little lovely whittling green knife...), though nobody can say why. It’s almost like secret knowledge we all share. Learn the language in a non-English-speaking country, however, and such ""secrets"" are taught in meticulous detail. Here’s a page from a book, published by Cambridge University Press, used regularly to teach English to non-native speakers. An English teacher in Hungary sent it to us. From English Grammar in Use—a self study reference and practise book for intermediate students by Raymond Murphy, published by Cambridge University Press in 1994. (Cambridge University Press) The book lays out the adjective order in the same way as Forsyth’s surprising illumination. Hungarian students, and no doubt those in many other countries, slave over the rule, committing it to memory and thinking through the order when called upon to describe something using more than one adjective. The fact is, a lot of English grammar rules only come as a surprise to those who know them most intimately. Learning rules doesn’t always work, however. Forsyth also takes issue with the rules we think we know, but which don’t actually hold true. In a lecture about grammar, he dismantles the commonly held English spelling mantra ""I before E except after C."" It’s used to help people remember how to spell words like ""piece,"" but, Forsyth says, there are only 44 words that follow the rule, and 923 that don’t. His prime examples?

3172,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It wasn’t long after the Michigan men’s basketball team won the Big Ten tournament this month when the moment arrived for the Wolverines to claim their polyester scalp: to bring out the ladders and let each player, coach and staff member take part in cutting down the nets. When the assistant coach Billy Donlon’s turn came, he made his snip, retreated down the ladder and handed off the scissors to his fellow assistant Jeff Meyer — gripping the blades and offering the handle, the way he and everyone else were taught in kindergarten. But when Donlon looked down moments later, he recalled last week, he saw his palm covered in blood. Donlon blamed ""adrenaline"" for his injury, a combination of his holding on to the scissors too tightly and Meyer’s grabbing them too forcefully. The wound required three stitches. Cutting down the nets is one of college basketball’s distinctive traditions, a rite of spring. When teams win a conference tournament, a regional title or a national championship, the scissors come out, the ladders go up and the nets are cut down. Television viewers saw the process play out multiple times this past week as four men’s and four women’s teams punched their tickets to the Final Four. Nike-sponsored teams even wore shirts printed with ""CUT THE NETS."" Yet the ceremony also has built-in (if rarely evident) danger, combining as it does excitement and a feeling of indomitability with a ladder and a sharp object. And just as Michigan’s Donlon emerged with a cut this March, North Carolina Coach Roy Williams sustained a similar one during a regional championship celebration last year. Williams is back in the Final Four this week, only two wins from his third national title — and yet another net-cutting. ""I’ve got some vertigo issues and I was up there on the ladder, and I felt like it was sort of moving a little bit as I was trying to cut the net,"" Williams recalled last week in Memphis of his experience last year. ""And I missed the net and cut my finger, and then I tried to macho it real well and hide it from everybody. And it was bleeding like crazy down there, and they ended up putting four or five stitches in it in the locker room."" The striking thing about the net-cutting ceremony may be not that there are injuries, but that there aren’t more. Officials who have spent many years with the Connecticut women’s basketball team — which has cut down a few nets given Coach Geno Auriemma’s 22 conference tournament titles, 18 Final Fours and 11 national championships — could not, for instance, recall a single injury from its previous celebrations. Phil Knight, the 79-year-old Nike co-founder and Oregon benefactor, who took his turn after Oregon beat Kansas last weekend, acknowledged the risks when he told a reporter afterward, ""They waited till I was really old, and it was scary up there."" But the Oregon sophomore Tyler Dorsey, who is also more than a half-century younger than Knight, brushed off concerns. He has partaken of two ceremonies with the Ducks: last year after winning the Pacific-12 tournament, and again Saturday night after booking a Final Four trip. ""There’s so much enjoyment, excitement — you’re not really worried about the scissors,"" Dorsey said. ""You handle scissors all the time."" The tradition has roots in Indiana high school basketball, according to Tim Peeler, the self-described ""unofficial historian"" of North Carolina State sports who now works for the university. When the Wolfpack won the Southern Conference tournament in 1947, Peeler said, their coach, Everett Case, a Hoosier, exported the tradition to Tobacco Road, where it spread throughout the college game. (Decades later, another N.C. State coach, Jim Valvano, famously had his players practice cutting down the nets in order to condition them to being winners — a tactic that perhaps paid off in their unlikely run to the 1983 national championship.) Those with more neurotic temperaments will be relieved to know that some precautions have been taken. During the net-cutting, the N.C.A.A. restricts the area inside the 3-point line to members of the team and its travel party, according to a spokesman, ""so that we keep the crowd by the basket as small as possible."" It also should come as little surprise that the N.C.A.A. has official scissors and ladder suppliers. This is the ninth year that Fiskars has supplied the official net-cutting scissors for the N.C.A.A. men’s and women’s championships (its trademarked orange-handled ones). A spokeswoman noted that the company includes consumer warnings on all of its packaging, which advise keeping the blades ""away from fingers and body"" and ""out of reach of children."" Presumably, 18- and 19-year-olds no longer qualify. But it is Werner, the ladder manufacturer also in its ninth year sponsoring both championships, that really appears to have gone above and beyond for the cause of safety this season. ""Being in the ladder business for as long as we have, climbing safety and climbing safely is part of our DNA,"" said Chris Filardi, the company’s vice president of marketing. Werner offers consumers a Podium series with an extended guardrail and a large platform for standing, but the version used in this year’s tournament is not for sale. ""We worked with the N.C.A.A. and did some averages of player height and size and weight,"" Filardi said, ""and our engineers worked with it."" The result is a ladder optimized for college basketball players — that is, exceptionally long-legged young men and women. The custom model also comes equipped with scissor-storage options, Filardi said, in the form of a magnet and a toolholder. No one seemed to take advantage of those safeguards over the weekend, though, and more than a few Oregon players here could be seen passing scissors to each other blades first. Ultimately, for the lucky teams that cut down the nets after winning national championships, there will be little excuse for injury. Not that injury is automatically a deal-breaker. ""If we get a chance to cut down the nets,"" said North Carolina’s Williams, ""I won’t give a flip if I cut my finger halfway off again.""","When the assistant coach Billy Donlon’s turn came, he made his snip, retreated down the ladder and handed off the scissors to his fellow assistant Jeff Meyer — gripping the blades and offering the handle, the way he and everyone else were taught in kindergarten.

3174,"© Carlo Allegri Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at Turnberry Golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, June 24, 2016. Shocked at the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, American political observers can't help but wonder: Will this help Donald Trump? Trump certainly thinks so. Saying ""people want to take their country back,"" the Republican presidential candidate told a news conference Friday in Scotland: ""I really do see a parallel between what's happening in the United States and what's happening here."" And while there are good signs for Trump in the Brexit vote, there are also signs it won't make much difference. ""Nobody really knows,"" Trump himself acknowledged. Among the good signs for Trump in the wake of Brexit: • It shows what potent issues immigration and free trade have become for voters who are struggling economically; these issues are at the heart of Brexit and the ongoing Trump campaign. • British politics have been known to presage developments in their former colony. Nearly four decades ago, conservative leader Margaret Thatcher overturned the British political establishment by becoming prime minister in 1979 — one year before Ronald Reagan did much the same thing by winning the American presidency. • Nationalism has re-emerged as a major political force in politics worldwide, and that bodes well for a candidate whose slogan is ""Make America Great Again."" • Both Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and President Obama supported British membership in the European Union; are they misreading the American political mood as well? There are also signs that Brexit won't matter in the United States in November: • This was an election unique to Europe, with few ramifications for the United States. • Markets in the United States and other countries are likely to take an economic hit over Brexit, at least in the short term, and there will be other unforeseen consequences; the blowback could hurt Trump-style politics. • Elections are about individuals, and Trump and Clinton are already well-known by American voters. New polls show Trump slipping behind Clinton; while the New York businessman is competitive in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio, he is struggling in must-win Republican states like Florida, Arizona, and Utah.","And while there are good signs for Trump in the Brexit vote, there are also signs it won't make much difference."

Popularity aside, there's also a fair amount of controversy surrounding Diet Coke's impact on the human body. In a thorough refuting of the most prominent Diet Coke damage theories, the Outline's Yvette d'Entremont is calling bullshit on the demonization of America's favorite aspartame vessel. Ever peeped an article about Diet Coke causing cancer and/or multiple sclerosis? You probably have. However, as explained in the Outline's detailed rebuttal, these claims are thus far ""full of shit."" Initial concern regarding an increase in various types of cancers actually began eight years before aspartame was introduced to consumers, with additional testing showing no causal relationship between the sweetener and cancer. As for MS fears, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society says there's currently ""no scientific evidence"" supporting claims of aspartame causing the chronic disease. The same goes for claims of Diet Coke causing depression, claims which arguably peaked upon publication of a 2013 study by the American Academy of Neurology. The study, which the Outline describes as ""an example of correlation and causation gone horribly awry,"" found that 4.3 percent of participants reported being diagnosed and treated for depression within a 10-year period. That study, as noted by the British Dietetic Association's Gaynor Bussell to BBC News at the time, was a ""one-off"" and should not be viewed as proof that such sweeteners cause depression. So Diet Coke allegedly gives you no cancer, no multiple sclerosis, and no depression? Damn. But it's definitely making everyone fat, right? Nah. The swath of articles out here placing the weight gain blame on Diet Coke, d'Entremont explains, typically all share one fatal flaw: the only variable is soda consumption. Additionally, many studies that end up being cited in articles with sensationalized headlines often fail to have participants thoroughly report their caloric intake. The full rundown of Diet Coke slander can be peeped here, though ending this post without some advice from a leading H2O enthusiast would just be unfair: Water holds the information and energy Drink more water.

3185,"TORONTO — The remains of a bustling port and barracks for sailors or military troops have been discovered near the Giza Pyramids. They were in use while the pyramids were being built about 4,500 years ago. The archaeologists have been excavating a city near the Giza Pyramids that dates mainly to the reign of the pharaoh Menkaure, who built the last pyramid at Giza. Also near the pyramids they have been excavating a town, located close to a monument dedicated to Queen Khentkawes, possibly a daughter of Menkaure. The barracks are located at the city, while a newly discovered basin, that may be part of a harbor, is located by the Khentkawes town. Several discoveries at the city and Khentkawes town suggest Giza was a thriving port, said archaeologist Mark Lehner, the director of Ancient Egypt Research Associates. For instance, Lehner's team discovered a basin beside the Khentkawes town just 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the nearest Nile River channel. [See Photos of Amazing Discoveries at Giza's Pyramids] This basin may be ""an extension of a harbor or waterfront,"" Lehner said at a recent symposium held here by the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities. Lehner said his team also found at Giza charcoal remains of cedar, juniper, pine and oak, all trees that grew in a part of the eastern Mediterranean called the Levant, along with more than 50 examples of combed ware jars, a style of pottery from that region. Additionally, large amounts of granite from Aswan, located on ancient Egypt's southern border, have long been known to be at Giza, and these could have been brought down the Nile River to Giza's port. ""Giza was the central port then for three generations, Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure,"" said Lehner in his presentation, referring to the three pharaohs who built pyramids at Giza. A military presence Where there is a port there are sailors. At the city the archaeologists found evidence that a series of long buildings called ""galleries"" held troops who could have participated in voyages to the Levant and possibly guarded VIPs while at Giza. These galleries were about 23 feet (7 meters) high and each set was at least 113 feet (34.5 meters) long, north to south. Archaeologists once assumed galleries like these held pyramid workers, something that recent discoveries call into question; in recent excavations of the galleries Lehner's team found charcoal remains from wood, particularly cedar, that was originally from the Levant. [Photos: The Lost City of the Pyramid Builders] ""What was all this cedar from the Levant doing in a common workers barracks?"" Lehner asked. In fact, these troops are represented in the tombs of highly placed officials and in pyramid temples. ""You have representations of these gangs, these troops, repeated over and over again,"" he said, adding that the word for them can be translated as ""escort"" or ""the following."" Each individual gallery could hold about 40 people comfortably, which is a unit these troops could be organized into, Lehner said. ""I wonder if we are basically seeing barracks not of the workers, but of elite crews of ships,"" Lehner said. A pharaoh named Sahure had images in his valley temple (part of his pyramid complex) of troops near the king's ""ship of state,"" he noted. Lehner's suspicions that the galleries were meant for troops were reinforced in 2012 when the archaeologists discovered a broken hippo hip. In ancient Egypt, hippos were considered nuisances, as the animals ate crops at night. ""The young troops go out and they harpoon them and spear them,"" he told the Toronto audience. There's actually a ritual in which a captured and bound hippo is harpooned to death. This ritual could have taken place at Giza at a public place such as the harbor, the hippo meat (apparently quite tasty) being consumed afterwards by the troops in the galleries. These troops didn't always get the best food. The hippo meat would have been a nice respite from their everyday diet. The bones the archaeologists found in the galleries indicate they consumed lots of goat and sheep as well as oily, bony, catfish, said Richard Redding, chief research officer at Ancient Egypt Research Associates, in another symposium presentation. The troops didn't get as much cattle or Nile perch, which were considered the more desirable forms of meat and fish. Redding is also a research scientist at the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology at the University of Michigan. Where are the pyramid builders? The recent discoveries at Giza leave a mystery in their wake: Where were the dwellings of the pyramid builders, the regular workers, located? The answer may be on the pyramids themselves. ""We could probably be correct imagining workers staying on the immense ramps, on the unfinished pyramid as it rose,"" said Lehner in an email to LiveScience, adding that they could also have been living in the quarries in simple dwellings akin to ""lean-to's."" The remains of these workers can be found in ancient dumps near the pyramids. ""In 2004 we helped the Giza inspectors salvage material from an immense dump off the northern side of the Great Pyramid,"" said Lehner in the email. ""We did not find remains of workers huts or lean-to's, but we did find old cattle bone, strips of cloth, rope and string of all gauges, fragments of wood, including part of a hammer, and other material of the workers.""",remains of a bustling port and barracks for sailors or military troops

Tesla's struggling stock rebounded on Thursday, a day after the company revised its sales forecast for 2016 upward, to 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles. There's a lot of hype around the Model 3 -- some drummed up by the company, and some created by the media. With the announcement that Tesla will begin accepting orders next month, some news reports said motorists would pay as little as $25,000 for the Model 3. Those enticing predictions bank on consumers receiving tax incentives. The federal government gives a $7,500 tax credit to electric car buyers, and some states have additional rebates. Sounds great, right? The federal program, however, is limited to the first 200,000 vehicles sold by a manufacturer, according to Bloomberg. Then, it gradually gets eliminated. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he wants the company to sell 500,000 cars by 2020, so the opportunity for Tesla buyers to cash in on the tax incentive is clearly limited. There's also a question of whether the company will deliver the Model X on time. Blowing deadlines has troubled Tesla before. The Model X debuted in September, about two years behind schedule. A Morgan Stanley analyst told Bloomberg he believes the Model 3 will launch a year late in 2018. Unlike the Tesla's Model X, there will be no limited-edition ""signature series"" version of the Model 3 with special features, Musk tweeted.","limited to the first 200,000 vehicles sold"

In fact according to the thousand women who were surveyed for the video, not one woman in a thousand considered the penis the sexiest part of the man, an opinion I think we can all agree on. Women love a man with good hair According to Marni Kinrys, who hosts the video for self help site the winggirlmethod.com , women do consider the penis sexy, just not when it’s just hanging there . But don’t worry guys because the shocking news is that almost every other part of a man is considered sexy by some women. Marni for examples is a big fan of a man who can make her laugh, saying she finds a sense of humour sexy, but that she’s also a fan of sexy hands (great news for all you hand models reading this). or a great butt... Other contenders were a man’s smile, eyes, abs, chest, butt, hair, wit, brain with Marni noting that women tend to look at men as a whole package rather than a stack of meat with a dick attached, our words not hers. Yeah we know that was a cop out but there’s some solid advice here which is work with what you’ve got because there’s someone out there for everyone.",almost every other part of a man is considered sexy by some women
3193,"If you're a vegetarian, we have some good news for you: Munching on all those plants may cut your risk for colorectal cancer -- the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. -- by about 20 percent. For the study, published in the March 9 online edition of JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers kept track of 77,000 men and women over the course of seven years. Roughly half the participants were meat-eaters, and the others fell into four vegetarian-like groups: Semi-vegetarians (ate meat less than once a week), pesco-vegetarians (ate fish but not other meat), lacto-ovo vegetarians (ate eggs and dairy but no meat) and vegans (no meat, no dairy, no eggs). Researchers found that after seven years, there were 380 colon cancer cases and 110 rectal cancer cases among the group. As it turns out, vegetarians were less likely to develop the disease compared to participants who ate meat, but pesco-vegetarians, in particular, were the real winners. ""All vegetarians together had on average a 22 percent reduction in the risk of developing colorectal cancer, compared with non-vegetarians,"" lead researcher Dr. Michael Orlich said, according to CBS. Those who ate fish, on the other hand, saw a 43 percent reduction rate. However, it should be noted there's still no concrete evidence that this reduction in colorectal cancer is due to diet. ""That's the problem in dietary studies of cancer. We don't know exactly what the connection is,"" Dr. Alfred Neugut, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center said, according to CBS. CNN points out that participants in the study sample are Seventh Day Adventists, ""a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco."" Colorectal cancer risk aside, there are plenty of other reasons to stick to a plant-based diet. Not only do vegetarians have a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and high blood pressure, but they can maintain a healthy weight more easily. ""Let face it. If you are eating a lot of plant foods, many of which have only 10 to 50 calories per cup, you are going to lose weight,"" Carole Bartolotto, RD, wrote in a blog post for The Huffington Post. ""If you eat these foods instead of fast, fatty, processed, and sweet foods, you will cut out a ton of calories -- and the best part is, you will feel full!""",may cut your risk for colorectal cancer -- the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. -- by about 20 percent
3194,"If You See A Purple Butterfly Sticker At The Hospital, This Is What It Means... Written by Faye Lee Millie found out she was pregnant and she and her partner Lewis were completely thrilled. But when they got the results of the of her ultrasound they learned she would be having twins and it was a dream come true for them. Millie wasn’t incredibly surprised as twins ran in her family so she was extremely proud to be passing on the tradition. However, as they were celebrating the wonderful news, the doctor came to them with information that would break their hearts. According to her doctor one of her unborn twins had a condition called anecephaly, which meant that the child would be unlikely to survive after being born and if it did, it wouldn’t live for a long time. The condition causes a portion of the brain to be underdeveloped. So the parents prayed hard for their unborn child, that both twins would survive. Tragically, God took one of the twins and she died soon after the emergency C-section Millie underwent. A woman who was unfortunately clueless about what Millie had just gone through commented to Millie that ‘You’re so lucky you haven’t got twins...’ According to her doctor one of her unborn twins had a condition called anecephaly, which meant that the child would be unlikely to survive after being born and if it did, it wouldn’t live for a long time.

Posted by Star Wars on Thursday, April 16, 2015 Has Facebook stunning video ascendancy over the past year stolen rival YouTube’s advertising thunder just as it was gaining momentum? Has the fact that Facebook now delivers 4 billion views a day convinced advertisers that the site is a potentially viable alternative to TV? No, not yet, according to advertisers. Though they do acknowledge that Facebook’s video business can’t be ignored. Major ad buyers say that Facebook’s video view numbers are undoubtedly impressive. But in terms of actual ad inventory, Facebook still pales in comparison to YouTube, which features pre-roll ads (something Facebook has shied away from) and has a more developed video ad business. ""The growth of video views on Facebook is staggering,"" said Adam Shlachter, chief investment officer at Digitas. ""But it’s still not 100% clear what the opportunities are to capitalize on that."" To that end, Facebook held its non-Newfront, NewFront-like presentation for advertisers last night in New York, during which is shared details on Anthology, the company’s branded video content initiative. The affair, held at Facebook’s New York office, included presentations from companies such as Vice, Tastemade and Funny or Die. The Anthology gathering was timed just a few days before the kickoff of the NewFronts, which are anchored by YouTube and its usually splashy event, and a few weeks before the major broadcast networks present their schedules for the coming season. All are competing for major advertisers’ marketing budgets. While Facebook got in front of advertisers first, it hasn’t necessarily taken the wind out of YouTube’s sails–or sales. ""I don’t think what [Facebook is] doing throws a wrench in anything YouTube is doing,"" said John Swift, Omnicom Media Group’s chief executive of North American investment. To be sure, YouTube’s ad strategy is far from perfect (as WSJ reported recently, the site has struggled to reach profitability). But the Google-owned video behemoth has made great strides over the past few years catering to advertisers’ demands for more TV-like data and buying options, while also making a concerted effort to market its biggest stars. And there’s no question that video ads posted on Facebook–like the ""Star Wars"" movie trailer–can take off like wildfire. Of course, those instances don’t always consist of solely paid media efforts. Let's catch that teaser trailer again! Marvel's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" in theaters May 1, 2015. Posted by Avengers on Thursday, October 23, 2014 For example, Visible Measures looked at 82 Web video campaigns released in March that in aggregate reached 437.5 million people through a combination of paid advertising or organic, people-driven sharing. More than half of those campaigns used Facebook. Among all the campaigns released in March, Facebook accounted for 35% of total viewership, versus 65% for YouTube. At the end of last year, Facebook’s share was in the single digits, found Visible Measures. ""There is a huge opportunity for Facebook to grab video ad dollars because of its targeting,"" said Brian Shin, Visible Measures’ chief executive. ""But we don’t see those dollars coming from YouTube."" Yet Facebook doesn’t seem to be in a huge rush to fully monetize its 4 billion daily video streams. Executives declined to provide much in the way of detail about the company’s long-term plans for its video ad business during yesterday’s earnings call. In the near term, the Anthology-branded partnership deals provide a way for the company to learn what its users like in terms of video alongside content creators and marketers. One interesting note from last night’s gathering, according to several executives in attendance, is that Facebook and its Anthology partners spoke about using the social network’s rich data set to inform what sort of programming gets developed through these deals. ""Facebook’s focus on real identity allows for rich creative development [and] personalization at scale,"" stated Steven Kydd, co-founder of Tastemade.",it hasn’t necessarily taken the wind out of YouTube’s sails–or sales
3196,"The Kansas City, Kansas Police Department are searching for a teenager and not for the reason you might think. Officer Rance Quinn and a coworker went out to a Chili’s for lunch and were surprised by a teenager approaching them. She laid a napkin on the table and walked away before anyone could say anything to her. It read, ""Thanks for keeping us safe."" KCK Police Department’s Facebook posted further details about what transpired after their meal. When they asked for the check, the wait staff informed the pair that the teenager’s family had settled their bill already. Following that, Quinn and his coworker were approached by a mother and her two young children. Her son was deaf and had always looked up to police officers and really wanted to meet one. The woman herself also possessed an admiration of the police force, but because she was deaf, she was unable to join. The officers happily obliged them, and chatted with the family a while. As they got up to leave, the woman handed them a gift card. She had really wanted to pay for their meal, but the other family had beat her to the punch. The officers were touched by this tidal wave of kindness and appreciation. Officer Quinn keeps the napkin in his pocket for inspiration. When morale is low and his job starts to get to him, he remembers the napkin. ""It’s a good reminder."" The original Facebook post urges people to ""please share in hopes that these gestures make it back to the people who did them so they will know just how appreciated and POWERFUL their actions were."" Take a look at the touching message below. It’s often the simplest things that mean the most.","It read, ""Thanks for keeping us safe."""
