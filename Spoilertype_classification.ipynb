It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up., But Brady’s definition of \"catching up\" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal \"catching\" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension., \"I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ \" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. \"And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ \", Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy., \"That’s the only thing we really have planned,\" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. \"It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something.\", Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough.]</td>\n",

Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco., The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer., They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer., \"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what's wrong with your car's engine without lifting the hood.\", Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others., \"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC., LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable., By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery., \"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\"]</td>\n",

Specially, those surveyed said intellectual stimulation accounts for 18.5 percent of their job satisfaction., That's compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money., \"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade's chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\", Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy:, Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don't say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do., Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don't want or need it., Offer employees extra money, security and social opportunities. However, only to the extent they say these things matter to them., \"If there is a major takeaway here, it's that we can finally prove that money doesn't buy happiness, and that happiness isn't as elusive as we might think,\" said Cangrade CEO Michael Burtov., The study was based on surveys of nearly 600 U.S. employees.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[It’s common wisdom. Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness:  , \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\" , In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\" , That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. , Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong. , Here are seven habits you need instead. , Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:, \"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" , Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? , Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. , Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" , Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. , Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:, \"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" , Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. , The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" , And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots. , Sleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \"No’s.\" , Angela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:, \"After you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\" , We all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely.  , The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\" , What accounted for this reversal of expectations?  , Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another. , Liran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io:, \"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what’s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it’s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\" , The only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be. , Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky. That’s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable. , Where passion disconnects us from reality, planning — especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety — drives home the true state of affairs.  , That true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \"The question when you’re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn’t be, ‘What going to go right?’ It should be, ‘What’s going to go wrong?’\" , Jason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.:, \"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\" , Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. , \"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. , Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves. , Troy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did:, \"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\" , Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion. , Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. , How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. , Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:, \"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\" , Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. , Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\" , Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh.  , Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\" , Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes. , Cal Newport’s prescription was skill: passion is the result of excellence, not it’s source.  , Far from a magic bullet, passion can mislead us, blind us, and even turn us in on ourselves. Newport was right: \"‘Follow your passion’ might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn’t burn out ... but endures. , Aaron Orendorff is the founder of iconiContent and a regular contributor at Entrepreneur, Lifehacker, Fast Company, Business Insider and more.

That is, slightly more water than rice in the pot as the water fills in the nooks between the grains of rice., 'Turn it on. Wait. Delicious rice! You can tweak a little bit if you like your rice fluffier or firmer.', Susan Shao also had some top tips for using a rice cooker - but many can apply to boiling rice using a pan as well., 'When using a rice cooker, I follow these steps and the rice always comes out perfectly., 'If you're not making sushi, wash the rice by rinsing it in cold water with your hand, making swirl motions three times.

She also advises adding just enough water to cover the rice. , But Jireh Tan offers an alternative for those who don't have a rice cooker, or don't want to invest in the equipment., Saying this technique has 'never' failed him, he advises washing the rice first, before measuring rice and water into a pot at a ratio of one cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water., He adds: 'With pot uncovered, bring water to the boil, and boil for an additional two minutes., 'Place the lid on the pot, reduce heat to lowest possible. Simmer for another eight minutes., 'Take the pot off the heat. With the lid on, let the rice rest for another 15 minutes. , 'Remove the lid and fluff the rice, allowing any excess moisture to evaporate.' , He adds that the lid should not be removed when taken off the heat, as otherwise the bottom of the pan may end up black and burnt with rice sticking to it. ]</td>\n",

radio station that he contacted Brady because he’ll be in town for Sunday’s game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium. It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up., But Brady’s definition of \"catching up\" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal \"catching\" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension., \"I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ \" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. \"And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ \", Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy., \"That’s the only thing we really have planned,\" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. \"It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something.\", Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough.]   \n",

full recovery. Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco., The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer., They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer., \"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what's wrong with your car's engine without lifting the hood.\", Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others., \"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC., LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable., By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery., \"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\"]   \n",

money isn't the key to employee happiness, new research finds., A study by hiring software provider Cangrade revealed that being intellectually stimulated is the most important aspect of an employee's job satisfaction. Specially, those surveyed said intellectual stimulation accounts for 18.5 percent of their job satisfaction., That's compared to money, which accounts for just 5.4 percent of how happy an employee is with the job. Achievement and prestige, power and influence, work-life balance and affiliation and friendship were all rated more important to job satisfaction than money., \"These findings are quite surprising, because employers often assume things like income are the strongest drivers of happiness in the workplace,\" said Steve Lehr, Cangrade's chief science officer. \"In fact, our research shows that it may be the weakest.\", Researchers developed a three-part formula for employers who are eager to keep their staff happy:, Try to ensure that jobs provide intellectual stimulation and task variety. Give employees some autonomy, influence and opportunities to acquire prestige and recognition. Employers should give employees these things even when they don't say they need them. Give them even more if they say they do., Employers should give all employees a break now and again, including the consummate workaholics who say they don't want or need it., Offer employees extra money, security and social opportunities. However, only to the extent they say these things matter to them., \"If there is a major takeaway here, it's that we can finally prove that money doesn't buy happiness, and that happiness isn't as elusive as we might think,\" said Cangrade CEO Michael Burtov., The study was based on surveys of nearly 600 U.S. employees.]   \n",
       "3  [It’s common wisdom. Near gospel really, and not just among young people and founders. Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness:  , \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\" , In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\" , That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. , Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong. , Here are seven habits you need instead. , Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:, \"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" , Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? , Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. , Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" , Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. , Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:, \"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" , Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. , The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" , And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots. , Sleep on it. Reach out. The sun will rise tomorrow. And be ruthless with your \"No’s.\" , Angela Duckworth, author of Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance:, \"After you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year.\" , We all love shortcuts. The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely.  , The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\" , What accounted for this reversal of expectations?  , Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another. , Liran Kotzer, CEO of Woo.io:, \"Passion is indeed very important, but what most people don't know is what’s needed to achieve their true potential. Whether it’s to acquire new skills, get a promotion, or achieve what they want, it all starts with having a plan based on real data and real-world options.\" , The only word less sexy than practice is planning. And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be. , Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky. That’s one of the reasons platform like Woo, which lets you get feedback from companies and headhunters anonymously, are so valuable. , Where passion disconnects us from reality, planning — especially planning of the SMART goal and number-crunching variety — drives home the true state of affairs.  , That true state rescues us from false expectations, show stoppers, and resentment. As a good friend of mine likes to say, \"The question when you’re trying to bring a dream into reality shouldn’t be, ‘What going to go right?’ It should be, ‘What’s going to go wrong?’\" , Jason Stone, founder of Millionaire Mentor Inc.:, \"Passion can only take you so far. After that, if you don't have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\" , Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. , \"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. , Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves. , Troy Osinoff, author of My Bad Parent: Do As I Say, Not as I Did:, \"People that think they completely understand their world are the most susceptible to overlook new opportunities. Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\" , Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion. , Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. , How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. , Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:, \"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\" , Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. , Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\" , Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh.  , Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\" , Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes. , Cal Newport’s prescription was skill: passion is the result of excellence, not it’s source.  , Far from a magic bullet, passion can mislead us, blind us, and even turn us in on ourselves. Newport was right: \"‘Follow your passion’ might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn’t burn out ... but endures. , Aaron Orendorff is the founder of iconiContent and a regular contributor at Entrepreneur, Lifehacker, Fast Company, Business Insider and more.

                      [Boiling rice may seem simple, but there is a very fine line between under-cooked crunchy grains and mushy over-cooked stodge., But now the perfect way to cook the rice has been shared on question-and-answer website Quora - and all it requires is one piece of equipment., Users were responding to the question 'How does one cook rice properly?' - proving that the basics are not always as simple to cook as we may think., Scroll down for video , The top voted answer for how to cook perfectly, which has been used more than 4,000 times, was refreshingly simple - but it does require some investment., Several commenters agreed that the best way to cook rice is in a rice cooker, which you can pick up from most high street stores for between £15 and £20., Cliff Chang wrote: 'Seriously, it's so much easier than any other method I've tried., 'Take your rice, wash it a bit - not too much - add enough water so that the waterline is twice as high as the rice-line. That is, slightly more water than rice in the pot as the water fills in the nooks between the grains of rice., 'Turn it on. Wait. Delicious rice! You can tweak a little bit if you like your rice fluffier or firmer.', Susan Shao also had some top tips for using a rice cooker - but many can apply to boiling rice using a pan as well., 'When using a rice cooker, I follow these steps and the rice always comes out perfectly., 'If you're not making sushi, wash the rice by rinsing it in cold water with your hand, making swirl motions three times. If you're making sushi rice, repeat this process 10 times instead of three., 'When you add rice, the general rule of thumb is half a cup of rice per person.' She also advises adding just enough water to cover the rice. , But Jireh Tan offers an alternative for those who don't have a rice cooker, or don't want to invest in the equipment., Saying this technique has 'never' failed him, he advises washing the rice first, before measuring rice and water into a pot at a ratio of one cup of rice to 1.5 cups of water., He adds: 'With pot uncovered, bring water to the boil, and boil for an additional two minutes., 'Place the lid on the pot, reduce heat to lowest possible. Simmer for another eight minutes., 'Take the pot off the heat. With the lid on, let the rice rest for another 15 minutes. , 'Remove the lid and fluff the rice, allowing any excess moisture to evaporate.' , He adds that the lid should not be removed when taken off the heat, as otherwise the bottom of the pan may end up black and burnt with rice sticking to it. ]   \n",

It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up.', 'But Brady’s definition of \"catching up\" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal \"catching\" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension.', '\"I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ \" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. \"And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ \"', 'Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy.', '\"That’s the only thing we really have planned,\" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. \"It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something.\"', 'Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough.']</td>\n",

The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer.', \"They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer.\", '\"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what\\'s wrong with your car\\'s engine without lifting the hood.\"', 'Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others.', '\"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC.', \"LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable.\", 'By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery.', '\"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\"']</td>\n",

If you haven\\'t found it yet, keep looking. Don\\'t settle.\" ', 'In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\" ', 'That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment. ', 'Newport’s not alone. In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong. ', 'Here are seven habits you need instead. ', 'Ryan Holiday, author of Ego Is the Enemy:', '\"Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" ', 'Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? ', 'Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. ', 'Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" ', 'Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. ', 'Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:', '\"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" ', 'Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head. ', 'The blinding effect of passion leads us unthinkingly into projects and meetings that, in truth, are dead ends. Worse, they sap time and energy that would otherwise move us forward. When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" ', 'And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots.

The allure of getting more by doing less is seductive. But are there times when doing more equals more? Absolutely.  ', 'The classic illustration comes from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s Art and Fear where a ceramics teacher divided his class into two groups. The first was told they’d be graded on quality. The other, quantity. To get an A, the quantity group was required to produce fifty pounds of clay pots. Not exactly an artistically inspired assignment. And yet, when grading time came, \"a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.\" ', 'What accounted for this reversal of expectations?  ', 'Easy: while the quality group held back — laboring under perfectionism — the quantity group got busy. They practiced. And that’s good news. If greatness came down to passion — or worse, talent — then it’d be reserved for only a select few. Practice means greatness is doable ... one tiny step after another.

And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be. ', 'Optimism is wonderful when it comes to our dreams. However, when it comes to what’s next — the nitty-gritty actions that’ll get us there — optimism kills. Infected with passion, our plans lose touch with reality. We overestimate strengths and underestimate challenges. Beyond the \"real data and real-world options,\" we build castles in the sky.

After that, if you don\\'t have the skills, the tools, the resources, the knowledge, and the track-record to move forward, take risks, and expand. Otherwise, you won’t be able to position yourself as an authority. Positioning is key to make sure you are ready when opportunity strikes!\" ', 'Humans are associative creatures. We think and act not in isolation but by comparing and contrasting. ', '\"The basic approach of positioning,\" wrote Al Ries and Jack Trout in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, \"is not to create something new and different, but to manipulate what’s already up there in the mind, to retie the connections that already exist.\" This is especially true when it comes to how other people see us. ', 'Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next. It embraces the associate nature of other people and — while it still leaves room for confidence — acknowledges that how others perceive us is more real, at least to them, than how we see ourselves.

Peripheral is about establishing an unwavering curiosity to use your existing knowledge in uncovering new patterns and trends both for the sake of your personal development as well as the success of your business or career.\" ', 'Passion makes us myopic. We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion. ', 'Adopting a peripheral perspective forces us to examine the margins. It widens our view. Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. ', 'How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life. Likewise, so is putting ourselves in new situations, reading books outside our passions, and intentionally pursuing people who have nothing to do with what it is we think we want. ', 'Brian D. Evans, founder of Influencive and Inc. 500 Entrepreneur:', '\"The person who calls themselves a student is more a master than those who try to wear the title. Get up when you get knocked down. Come back stronger, faster, and (above all) smarter. The constant desire to learn and overcome has helped me achieve everything. You must persevere.\" ', 'Although it might sound odd, perseverance is as much about putting in effort as it is battling ego. Drunk on passion, masters are doomed to repeat failures in the name of \"pushing through.\" In contrast, students do more than hone their craft; they learn from their mistakes. ', 'Asked if the Patriot’s historic comeback in Super Bowl LI was his \"greatest game ever,\" Tom Brady replied: \"[W]hen I think of an interception return for a touchdown, some other missed opportunities in the first 37, 38 minutes of the game, I don’t really consider playing a good quarter-and-a-half, plus overtime as one of the ‘best games ever’ but it was certainly one of the most thrilling.\" ', 'Certainly Brandy persevered, and it’d be nice if that guaranteed success. But sometimes you won’t come back to win it. At least, not in the moment. Jobs will be lost. Pitches turned down. Relationships ended. And reviews harsh.  ', 'Failure, however, isn’t just an inevitable stepping stone toward success. Rejection is part of success itself. As Louis CK put it to a budding comedian, \"The only road to good shows is bad ones. Just go start having a bad time and, if you don’t give up, you will get better.\" ', 'Understood rightly, no. But as the be-all-and-end-all? Yes.

Newport was right: \"‘Follow your passion’ might just be terrible advice.\" Thankfully, these seven habits put passion in its place so that the fire Jobs spoke of doesn’t burn out ... but endures.

times this weekend for Tom Brady and Wes Welker.', 'Welker revealed Friday morning on a Miami radio station that he contacted Brady because he’ll be in town for Sunday’s game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium. It seemed like a perfect opportunity for the two to catch up.', 'But Brady’s definition of \"catching up\" involves far more than just a meal. In fact, it involves some literal \"catching\" as the Patriots quarterback looks to stay sharp during his four-game Deflategate suspension.', '\"I hit him up to do dinner Saturday night. He’s like, ‘I’m going to be flying in from Ann Arbor later (after the Michigan-Colorado football game), but how about that morning we go throw?’ \" Welker said on WQAM, per The Boston Globe. \"And I’m just sitting there, I’m like, ‘I was just thinking about dinner, but yeah, sure. I’ll get over there early and we can throw a little bit.’ \"', 'Welker was one of Brady’s favorite targets for six seasons from 2007 to 2012. It’s understandable him and Brady want to meet with both being in the same area. But Brady typically is all business during football season. Welker probably should have known what he was getting into when reaching out to his buddy.', '\"That’s the only thing we really have planned,\" Welker said of his upcoming workout with Brady. \"It’s just funny. I’m sitting there trying to have dinner. ‘Hey, get your ass up here and let’s go throw.’ I’m like, ‘Aw jeez, man.’ He’s going to have me running like 2-minute drills in his backyard or something.\"', 'Maybe Brady will put a good word in for Welker down in Foxboro if the former Patriots wide receiver impresses him enough.']   \n",

when NASA scientists are predicting the hole in the ozone layer might finally make a full recovery. Researchers announced their conclusion, in addition to other findings, in a presentation Wednesday during the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.\", 'The team of scientists specifically looked at the chemical composition of the ozone hole, which has shifted in both size and depth since the passing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The agreement banned its 197 signatory countries from using chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that break down into chlorine in the upper atmosphere and harm the ozone layer.', \"They found that, while levels of chlorine in the atmosphere have indeed decreased as a result of the protocol, it's too soon to tie them to a healthier ozone layer.\", '\"Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,\" Susan Strahan of NASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center explained in a media briefing. \"That assumption is like trying to understand what\\'s wrong with your car\\'s engine without lifting the hood.\"', 'Instead, the scientists believe the most recent ozone hole changes, including both the largest hole ever, in 2006, and one of the smallest holes, in 2012, are primarily due to weather. Strong winds have the ability to move ozone in large quantities, effectively blocking the hole some years, while failing to block it in others.', '\"At the moment, it is winds and temperatures that are really controlling how big [the ozone hole] is,\" Strahan told the BBC.', \"LiveScience reports weather is expected to be the predominant factor in the ozone hole's size until 2025, at which point CFCs will have dropped enough as a result of the Montreal Protocol to become noticeable.\", 'By 2070, however, the ozone hole is expected to have made a full recovery.', '\"It’s not going to be a smooth ride,\" Strahan cautioned the Los Angeles Times. \"There will be some bumps in the road, but overall the trend is downward.\"']   \n",

Across generational lines, sentiments like those from Steve Jobs’ 2005 commencement at Stanford have been engraved into our collective consciousness:  ', '\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\\'t found it yet, keep looking. Don\\'t settle.\" ', 'In other words, follow your passion. There’s just one problem: \"‘Follow your passion’ is dangerous advice.\" ', 'That’s a troubling claim, but it comes straight from Cal Newport’s investigation into \"the details of how passionate people like Steve Jobs really got started\" as well as what scientists say predicts happiness and fuels great accomplishment.

In recent years, a host of leaders, academics, and entrepreneurs have all come to the same startling conclusion: nearly everything you’ve been told about following your passion is wrong.

Because just as often, we fail with — no, because of — passion. ... [P]urpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.\" ', 'Until about a century ago, passion was a dirty word. Classical philosopher like Socrates and Marcus Aurelius saw passion as a liability not an asset: an insatiable and destructive force. Why? ', 'Chiefly because passion is dangerously self-centered. In fact, our own modern descriptions of passion betray this inward bend: \"I want to [blank]. I need to [blank]. I have to [blank].\" In most cases, whatever word finishes those sentences — regardless of how well meaning it might be — is overshadowed by the first. ', 'Purpose, on the other hand, is about them, not me. It reorients our focus onto the people and causes we’re trying to reach, serve, help, and love. In The Happiness Hypothesis, psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes this pursuit as a \"striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\" ', 'Passion makes us bigger. Purpose connects us to something bigger and in doing so makes us right sized. ', 'Shaa Wasmund, author of Stop Talking, Start Doing:', '\"‘No’ is a far more powerful word than ‘Yes.’ Every ‘Yes’ said out of obligation or fear takes time away from the things and people we love. When an opportunity appears connected with your passion, it’s even trickier. Instead of snatching up everything that might get your closer to the life you want, give yourself the space to pick carefully.\" ', 'Good is the enemy of great. That’s how Jim Collins put it anyway. Learning to say \"No\" is easily one of the most vital skills we can cultivate. And yet, even if you’ve mastered \"No\" to the obvious stuff, passion rears its head.

When Tim Ferriss asked journalist Kara Swisher what message she’d put on a billboard for millions to see, her answer was a single word, \"Stop.\" ', 'And that’s what picking is all about: slow down, pause, evaluate, weigh, and only then make a clear-headed choice. Picking involves, first, putting a time buffer on our decisions, particularly decisions that appear \"connected with your passion.\" Second, running our choices by an objective third party: a friend or colleague who can call out our blind spots.

And yet planning is a golden thread woven through the lives of artists, leaders, and entrepreneurs alike. The trick here is that plans need not be grandiose. Rather, they shouldn’t be.

', 'Passionate people often come off as self-inflated. They’re legends in their own minds. Positioning means leveraging who you are and what you’ve done as a springboard to what’s next.

We become so focused on the desire inside us, we lose sight of what’s around us. Objectivity — the ability to see the world as it truly is — atrophies in the blinding light of passion.

Rather than rush headlong into disaster, we’re able to spot not just the pitfalls but the opportunities we would have otherwise missed. ', 'How? By cultivating curiosity. Questions like, \"What am I missing? What am I ignoring? Who could give me a fresh take?\" are vital in every area of life.
